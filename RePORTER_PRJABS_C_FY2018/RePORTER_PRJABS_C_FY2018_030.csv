"9446753","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that affects the lungs in 90% of patients resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. The disease has variable outcomes including persistent and/or progressive and remitting disease, and there are no reliable or validated clinical tools available to predict these outcomes. The goal of this study is it investigate changes in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) CD4+ T cell phenotype and specific T cell lineage gene expression prospectively to understand the role of Th17.1 and Treg cells with disease course. We will expand upon our novel findings that the most prevalent T effector cell in sarcoidosis lung lavage are Th17.1 cells, capable of significant interferon? (IFN?) production (and may be a source of additional mediators yet undefined). We also found that the abundance of Th17.1 cells were inversely proportional to Treg cells, so that the highest frequencies of Th17.1 and the lowest frequencies of Treg cells were found in patients with advanced disease. Our hypothesis is that the dynamic relationship of multiple T cell effector lineages (Th1, Th17, Th17.1, Treg cells) affects the variable pathobiology and outcomes in sarcoidosis. We hypothesize that sarcoidosis subjects with remitting disease have a decrease in BAL Th17.1 cells and increase in Treg cells over time. This is accompanied by dynamic changes in the transcriptional signatures of the T cell lineages, which regulate their activity and plasticity. Using a longitudinal bronchoscopy study design that has not been undertaken in sarcoidosis, we will prospectively enroll recently diagnosed sarcoidosis subjects and sample BAL cells at two time-points to address our aims. Aim 1 will examine T cell lineage diversity changes during sarcoidosis pathogenesis longitudinally in subjects with progressive vs. remitting disease. In paired lung and blood samples, we will use multi-parameter flow cytometry analysis to compare the frequencies of Th1, Th17, Th17.1, and Treg cells with clinical course (PFTs, chest x-ray, organ involvement). In Aim 2, we will analyze alterations of T cell lineage activity during sarcoidosis pathogenesis via genome wide transcriptional profiles of isolated Treg, Th17, Th17.1 and Th1 cells using low-input RNA- sequencing. Flow sorted lung T cell populations will be used for low-input RNA-seq to compare longitudinal changes to transcriptional signatures between T lineages cells with clinical course. Next, paired total lung and blood RNA-seq analysis will be compared to identify overlapping signatures, which correlate with disease outcomes. In aim 3, we will construct computational tools from T cell lineage diversity and gene expression data to define and/or predict sarcoidosis endotypes using bioinformatic deconvolution and biostatistical methods. The coupling of clinical, genomic and bioinformatic analysis will identify cellular and transcriptional patterns that can be used to define novel sarcoidosis endotypes. These endotypes may impact future therapeutic trials targeting specific cells in the immune response to achieve disease remission."
"9516363","ABSTRACT  The perinatal period, defined as the period from pregnancy through the first postpartum year, is a critical time for weight management intervention and provides a unique opportunity to understand factors associated with weight and eating behaviors. In response to PAR-16-304, we propose to leverage our ongoing efforts to evaluate sequences of weight management across the perinatal period by evaluating the contribution of behavioral phenotypes to perinatal obesity. Specifically, we propose to examine the link between impulsive phenotypes and perinatal weight. Impulsive phenotypes are associated with higher body mass index, greater weight gain over time, and poor response to weight management interventions. The effects of impulsive phenotypes on weight changes also are bidirectional. However, the role of impulsive phenotypes on weight trajectories over the perinatal period, and how these phenotypes may affect response to perinatal weight interventions, is unknown. Our work, and that of others, has documented strong links between weight and impulsive phenotypes characterized by: (1) disinhibited behavior, (2) attentional deficits, (3) impulsive decision- making, and (4) cognitive inflexibility, though it remains unclear whether and how these impulsive phenotypes predict weight trajectories and eating behavior over the perinatal period or response to perinatal intervention. Accordingly, we plan to assess these impulsive phenotypes among women with overweight or obesity enrolled in a perinatal weight trial. Women with overweight or obesity before pregnancy are currently being recruited and followed in a sequential multiple assignment trial designed to evaluate sequences of perinatal weight management interventions associated with improved maternal weight and health one year postpartum (R01HL132578). Women are enrolled at the beginning of prenatal care and randomly assigned to intervention that addresses the unique challenges of weight during pregnancy or a comparison condition involving treatment as usual. At delivery, women again are randomized to postpartum weight intervention or treatment as usual. We propose to add behavioral tasks and questionnaire assessments of impulsive phenotypes and eating behaviors to capitalize on the data collected in this parent trial. The specific aims are to (1) examine impulsive phenotypes as predictors of perinatal weight trajectories across the postpartum year, and (2) evaluate relationships among impulsive phenotypes, perinatal interventions and weight loss outcomes and eating behaviors. We also will explore the joint trajectories of weight and impulsive phenotypes from pregnancy through 12-months postpartum. Assessing impulsive phenotypes within a study of perinatal weight intervention will enhance the understanding of behavioral and cognitive factors associated with weight trajectories across the postpartum year. These data will support efforts to personalize weight management interventions and contribute to the development of novel behavioral perinatal interventions to improve longer-term health."
"9465529","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Impaired arm function is a major cause of chronic disability among stroke survivors. A number of treatment approaches have been developed to facilitate the recovery of arm function, targeting stroke induced motor impairments such as paresis, spasticity and losses of independent joint control that result in involuntary elbow, wrist and finger flexion while lifting the arm (i.e., the flexion synergy). However, our understanding of how muscle adapts to these impairments over time is not clear at this juncture nor how changes in muscle properties impact the functional use of the paretic arm. Therefore, we propose to determine the extent of structural changes in the skeletal muscles of the paretic arm due to the persistence of a prominent flexion synergy, paresis, and the associated disuse of the paretic upper limb. Subsequently, we propose to demonstrate the effects of these secondary musculoskeletal changes on the ability to generate functional arm movements by using novel simulations of combined arm and hand motion. We postulate that the flexion synergy, paresis, and the chronic disuse of the paretic upper limb that results from the stroke, induce substantial changes in both passive and active muscle properties, thus limiting the ability to generate functional arm movements, even if normal neural drive from the brain would be restored. In Aim 1, we propose to investigate the relationship between the abnormal flexion synergy and increases in passive stiffness that result in more flexed arm postures in individuals with stroke. In Aim 2 we propose to characterize changes in muscle architectural parameters (i.e., fascicle and sarcomere length, and muscle volume) following stroke and determine the effect of any structural deviations from age-matched able-bodied individuals on maximum isometric force generation ability, as indicated by calculating muscle physiological cross-sectional area, a standard anatomical measure of an individual muscle's ability to generate force. Finally, as part of Aim 3 we propose to employ state-of-the-art forward dynamics simulation techniques using an upper limb model that integrates the arm and hand to determine the extent to which altered muscle properties (Aims 1 & 2) and abnormal muscle co-activation patterns (Aim 1) account for the severe limitations in functional use of the upper limb experienced by individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that determining the exact role of altered muscle properties on functional use of the paretic upper limb following chronic hemiparetic stroke will allow for the design of more effective rehabilitation interventions This will change the way clinicians approach the rehabilitation of the paretic upper limb by highlighting the relative importance of the various musculoskeletal changes which combined with the proposed measurement tools provide the means to design and test therapies to reduce or prevent detrimental changes in muscle following stroke."
"9539327","Project Summary The overarching goal of the Academic Industrial Partnership grant is to develop a population risk-stratification tool that will allow efficacious and cost-effective lung cancer screening. Lung cancer represents an ideal malignancy for screening because of its prevalence, identifiable risk groups (current/former smokers) and ability to surgically cure the disease if diagnosed early. However, there are no robust screening techniques with options such as low-dose CT (LDCT) scans fraught with cost and harm from large numbers of false positives. In order to make lung cancer screening viable, it is imperative to develop a test to pre-screen for LDCT by identifying the subset of patients who are likely to harbor lung cancers and would benefit from LDCT. The test must be sensitive to early disease (e.g. Stage I), low-cost, and able to be carried out in a primary care setting. The goal of this project is to develop such a test. One attractive approach is to exploit field carcinogenesis, the concept that the same genetic/environmental milieu that results in a lesion in one area of the lung will impact upon the entire aero digestive mucosa. The buccal (cheek) mucosa is a ?molecular mirror? of lung carcinogenesis, although current techniques are inadequate to translate this phenomenon into a minimally intrusive screening test. The preliminary data show that the alteration of nanoscale architecture in buccal cells is exquisitely sensitive to field carcinogenesis and hence may serve as a robust biomarker for lung cancer. These nano-architectural changes can be detected in a practical and highly accurate fashion via a novel biophotonics technology, partial wave spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy (?nanocytology?). In this study, PWS technology will be refined and a prediction rule developed based on the PWS-detectable nanoscale alterations that is optimized for early stage, curable lung cancer. The goal of the proposed project is to finalize the remaining technology development aspects to translate nanocytology into a practical, accurate, and low- cost test, bring it to the point where it is viable for population screening, and conduct a pre-definitive clinical validation. The team envision that upon completion of this project, nanocytology will be ready for a definitive clinical trial leading to a launch in clinical practice. This novel paradigm could transform the clinical practice of lung cancer screening and thereby mitigate the large toll of this malignancy in Americans."
"9459997","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to study the neurobiological mechanisms of affective resilience to anxiety and stress, and to identify strategies for enhancing resilience specifically in highly vulnerable individuals. Our general hypothesis is that epigenetic mechanisms are critical predisposing factors that shape responsiveness to negative valence and impact vulnerability to chronic anxiety disorders. More specifically, we focus on the Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) which serves as a master molecular organizer that is critical during development and continues to be active in shaping affective responsiveness throughout life. This proposal tests the hypothesis that FGF2 is an endogenous resilience molecule that is not only a target of epigenetic mechanisms but is itself a modifier of these mechanisms that, in turn, fine-tune affective responsiveness.    The proposed series of studies relies on two lines of rats that we have genetically selected based on their propensity to explore a mildly stressful novel environment. Our breeding strategy over 40 generations has resulted in contrasting behavioral phenotypes that capture a stable bias towards negative valence responsiveness versus positive valence responsiveness. In particular, bred Low-Responder rats (bLRs) exhibit greater basal anxiety and depression behaviors, greater fear conditioning, greater responsiveness to chronic and social defeat stress, lower levels of hippocampal FGF2 and a distinct epigenetic profile when compared to bred High Responders (bHRs) that are significantly more resilient. Thus bLRs are a model of vulnerability to negative affective disorders and a target for resilience enhancement.  Aim 1 uses direct administration of FGF2 to promote resilience during early life and in adolescence. It also investigates environmental complexity (EC) as a strategy for promoting resilience during adolescence. It studies the impact of these interventions on two molecular master organizer genes in hippocampus- FGF2 itself, which reduces anxiety and the glucocorticoid receptor GR, which enhances anxiety behavior.  Aim 2 characterizes the basal epigenetic profiles associated with the bHR/bLR phenotypes and the impact of resilience induction on these profiles both at the global level and in association with FGF2 and GR promoters. These studies will be extended to anatomical analyses using a range of tools including Clarity.  Aim 3 addresses at a mechanistic level the functional bidirectional relationship between FGF2 and epigenetic mechanisms and their impact on resilience--- be it basal resilience (in bHRs) or induced (in bLRs). It uses virally-mediated, targeted RNA intervention strategies to knockdown either FGF2 or histone modifying enzymes in the hippocampus and determine whether they play an essential role in the induction of resilience.  Together, these studies will provide a highly targeted approach to understanding and harnessing epigenetics as key factors in affect regulation."
"9470845","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops for an unknown and variable amount of time before its symptoms fully manifest. But, when the symptoms become clinically observable, a significant neurodegeneration has already taken place. Thus, there is a largely unmet need for technologies that can aid the effective early diagnosis and prognosis of AD in an in vivo and more objective manner. The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes of brains with multimodality neuroimaging for both early diagnosis and prognosis of AD. AD is a highly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with complex pathophysiology, thus very challenging to pinpoint its subtle pathologies without any aid from advanced computational technologies. To this end, we propose the following four specific aims to identify those subtle disease-induced alterations, derive robust diagnostic conclusions, and predict future disease trajectories. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop a multi-view feature representation technique to robustly extract complementary information from neuroimaging data with multiple representative atlases, and then identify a small subset of most discriminative features for AD diagnosis. This novel multi-atlas technique will deviate from the conventional single-atlas approaches in feature representation, which are often susceptible to inter-subject structural variability, registration error, and atlas selection bias. In Aim 2, we will further devlop two novel multi-view feature mapping techniques for collaborative fusion of multimodality information by explicitly considering the distribution heterogeneity of different categories of features extracted from different modalities. This will significantly avoid the unnecessary complexity of feature distributions after our collaborative fusion, thus increasing the efficacy of subsequent diagnostic classifiers. Specifically, a deep learning technique (with deep multi-layered architecture) will be adopted to hierarchically mine multimodality information that resides nonlinearly both within each modality and between different modalities. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-task sparse learning technique for joint prediction of diagnostic status and clinical scores (e.g., ADAS-Cog and MMSE) by considering the inherent correlations between features and between training samples. This will also allow us to exploit the latent structure underlying the data for robust estimation of these highly variable clinical scores. Finally, in Aim 4, we will jointly predict clinical scores of each given subject in multiple future time points, by developing coupled random forests that can take advantage of all training subjects with complete or even incomplete multimodality data and further enforce temporal consistency of those estimated clinical scores.  All the above-proposed techniques will be evaluated by a large image set of elderly subjects in ADNI. We expect that the successful completion of this renewal project will result in a comprehensive and effective diagnosis/prognosis framework for improving early detection of AD. The respective software tools will be released freely to the research community, as we have done with our HAMMER software, which has been downloaded by >5200 users from >20 countries."
"9631564","Contact PD/PI: Laurencin, Cato , T. Regenerative Engineering of Complex Musculoskeletal Tissues and Joints -- 1 DP1 AR068147-01  Over the past 20 years, the P.I. has performed substantial work in the development of engineered systems for the regeneration of musculoskeletal tissues. Systems inspired by his work in the area of bone and soft tissue have now been implanted in man. Now I will use the collective expertise and insight I have obtained to test a bold, new hypothesis that complex tissues and joints can be created and similarly find their way to clinical use in man. For this I will use principles of Regenerative Engineering, concepts recently published in Science, Translational Medicine that refer to the use of new advances in materials science, stem cell science and the understanding of cues from developmental biology in heuristic approaches toward complex tissue regeneration. I will explore integrating the individual component tissues developed via the regenerative engineering approach using expertise in developing matrix and cell-matrix constructs for engineering tissues. As the next step we will develop what I term integrated graft systems (IGS) such as osteochondral, osteoligamentous, muscle/tendon and vascularized tissues. Subsequent steps will examine the integration of peripheral nerve into the tissue systems and to develop additional component tissues. Cues are important. I will use experience in drug delivery and investigate the use of biological effector molecules such as the bone morphogenetic proteins as cues for differentiation. We have recently described a group of molecules we term inducerons?small molecule inducers of differentiation that may be particularly suited for musculoskeletal regeneration. Working with our collaborator, we will utilize cues from developmental biology, particularly limb regeneration as an important part of our work. Finally, we have gained substantial expertise in electrical/biomechanical cues for tissue regeneration. I believe we can utilize these cues for the generation of new functional joint tissues as well as integrated graft systems. The ultimate goal of the work is to use new insights in biomaterials including nanomaterials, stem cell technologies, and developmental biology, along with particular strength areas of the P.I., such as bioreactor based enhanced fluid and nutrient transport, to bring the possibility of whole limb regeneration to reality. While the P.I. has substantial experience in the area, the integration of tissues to the level this complex has never been performed, and represents quite a new direction for him. There is substantial risk in the research, as issues of adequate nutrient and oxygen transport to developing tissues, successful interfacial integration of constructs, and meeting functional requirements will need to be tackled. If successful however, this Pioneer Award Research project will usher in the new era of regenerative engineering, providing revolutionary clinical solutions to millions.

"9460372","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Muscle sarcomeres contain a number of giant polypeptides (0.7-4 MDa). Much is currently known about the function of the largest of these polypeptides, vertebrate titin. Much less is known about the newest vertebrate member of this family, obscurin. The pathogenesis of one form of muscular dystrophy may involve obscurin. Obscurin is the homolog of UNC-89 in C. elegans. Essential features of UNC-89 as a signaling / scaffolding protein crucial for A-band/M-line assembly were discovered before obscurin was reported. To understand how UNC-89 is localized, and how it functions, we are taking a systematic approach for identifying and studying the function of its binding partners. We discovered that the Ig1-3 segment of UNC-89 interacts with CPNA-1, a copine domain protein. Although CPNA-1 is not required for initial assembly of UNC-89 at the M-line, it is required for it retention. CPNA-1 is located at both M-lines and dense bodies, whereas UNC-89 is located only at M-lines. Therefore, we hypothesize that there are proteins which direct assembly of UNC-89 solely to the M-line. UNC-89 Ig9-11 interacts with CUL-1 (cullin 1), and UNC-89 Ig2-3 interacts with MEL-26, a substrate recognition protein for CUL-3 (cullin 3). Cullins are scaffolds for assembly of the ubiquitination machinery. One function of the CUL-3/MEL-26 complex is to promote degradation of MEI-1 (katanin). Independently, the coI of this proposal, Stephan Lange, found that in mouse heart, degradation of sAnk1.5 is promoted by a cullin 3 substrate recognition protein, KCTD6, and this is dependent upon obscurin. We hypothesize that UNC-89 (obscurin) negatively regulates the activity of cullin complexes in muscle. We further hypothesize that UNC-89 interacts with other cullins or cullin 3 adaptor proteins, and there are substrates in addition to MEI-1. In humans, muscle atrophy is associated with immobilization, chronic diseases and advanced age. Since in muscle atrophy, degradation of sarcomeric proteins is upregulated, our studies have medical relevance. Also, our collaborator and coI of this grant, Ken Norman, has found that a key function of obscurin for organization of the SR, is conserved for UNC-89. In addition, UNC-89 was found to have a physiological role in EC coupling, and this involves the conserved RacGEF, VAV-1. We hypothesize that UNC-89 and VAV-1 interact, and that VAV-1 localization and function is dependent on UNC-89. Finally, we hypothesize that the binding partners and functional mechanisms discovered for UNC-89 in C. elegans are biologically relevant for mammalian striated muscle. Specific aims are: (1) determine mechanisms which direct assembly of UNC-89 solely to the M-line; (2) determine if other cullins interact with UNC-89, if there are additional substrates for MEL-26, and determine the biochemical effects of the UNC-89 to MEL-26 interaction; (3) define the biochemistry and functional consequence of interaction between UNC-89 and myosin; (4) investigate the molecular mechanism underlying UNC-89's role in calcium regulation; and (5) determine if functional interactions and molecular mechanisms identified for nematode UNC-89 are conserved for mammalian obscurin."
"9432021","Project Summary Cardiopulmonary failure due to acute respiratory failure or shock is the most common syndrome necessitating intensive care unit services. Patients with cardiopulmonary failure often develop burdensome neurocognitive sequelae that threaten both short and long-term outcomes. In the short-term, these patients frequently develop delirium, a severe alteration in attention and cognition that is associated with increased mortality as well as longer durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. After recovering, 1 in 4 survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment (LTCI) similar to dementia. Despite the impact delirium and LTCI have on these patients, there are currently no proven pharmacologic therapies aimed at preventing these neurocognitive sequelae. Sepsis accounts for over 1 million hospitalizations per year and is the most common cause of cardiopulmonary failure, making it an ideal population to investigate the underlying mechanisms of delirium and LTCI. Our group and others have shown that delirium and LTCI are characterized by injury to the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Animal models show a similar pattern of neuronal injury, and implicate alterations in glutamate homeostasis and kynurenine metabolism as key downstream pathways of neuronal injury that can be therapeutically targeted. However, a lack of data on these pathways in humans and an inability to identify which patients would most likely benefit from early therapy are key knowledge gaps limiting the translation of these findings to clinical trials. To address these knowledge gaps, this proposal will investigate the role of glutamate and kynurenine dysregulation in an ongoing cohort of septic patients with cardiopulmonary failure who are followed prospectively for delirium and subsequent cognitive impairment. In addition to the proposed research, the candidate will engage in a rigorous training program designed to support his transition into an independent scientist. The specific objectives of this proposal are to: 1) determine the association of glutamate and kynurenine dysregulation with delirium and cognitive impairment in septic patients with cardiopulmonary failure, 2) identify risk factors for cognitive impairment and develop a predictive tool that could be used to guide enrollment in future clinical trials, 3) train the candidate in cognitive neuroscience, mechanisms of neuronal injury and repair, cohort study design and conduct, molecular laboratory techniques and advanced statistics, and 4) provide the candidate with individualized mentoring to support his transition to independence. The candidate's attainment of specific research and training benchmarks will be regularly reviewed by his mentors and advisory committee. Through completion of this proposal, the candidate will enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of delirium and LTCI in these patients, and position himself to successfully compete for R01 funding of future projects aimed at testing neuroprotective therapies."
"9456520","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mechanisms Underlying Heterotopic Ossification Heterotopic ossification (HO) is bona fide bone formation outside of the normal skeletal system. The precise mechanisms underlying HO are unknown, although numerous signaling pathways and cellular components, local and systemic, have been implicated. Our previous work demonstrated that dysregulation of the neuroinflammatory factor, substance P (SP), along with mast cells and macrophages, leads to elevated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling that triggers the pathological process. Glast and Tie2 expressing mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) respond to the inductive signals and form ectopic bone through endochondral ossification. Our central hypothesis is that unlike normal skeletogenesis, the process of HO is an injury/inflammation induced, abnormal local morphogenic phenomenon. Specifically, multiple disease specific contributing factors, including both cellular and extracellular molecular elements, co-ordinate with each other to form a unique hierarchical microenvironment, similar to endogenous stem cells niches, to induce and propagate HO. In the niche, MSCs recruited from local tissues are the cells of origin of HO, and specific local supportive cellular (e.g. local neres, mast cells) and molecular (e.g. SP) components are crucial to regulate the stereotyped self-renewal, proliferation, chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of these MSCs. Thus development of therapeutic approaches must consider the role of the local innervation and mast cells as well as local sources of cells of origin of HO. This requires an interdisciplinary approac to study the niche as a minimum functional unit, the goal of this proposal. Understanding the characteristics of the cells of origin of HO will be necessary for precise therapeutic targeting to prevent or limit the disorder. The first part of the proposed studies will examine the niche dwelling cells that directly participate in HO. The second part will study the niche supportive cells and key molecular components that initiate and propagate HO. A major focus will be to examine the therapeutic effectiveness in preventing or limiting HO by inhibiting factors, such as SP, that play a central role in the HO niche. Thus the overall goal is to develop a therapy for thi debilitating disorder for which there currently is no effective treatment."
"9457228","Brain imaging studies have found alterations in striatal dopamine D2R binding in several mental disorders associated with altered motivation including schizophrenia, ADHD and drug addiction. In spite of these observations it is still unclear how changes in D2R levels alter striatal circuit function and motivation. In the first 4.5 years of this RO1 project we have found that D2R overexpression in the ventral striatum (Nucleus accumbens core; NAcc) of the mouse enhances motivation. We further identified a new mechanism by which D2Rs could regulate motivation: Like presynaptic D2Rs in dopamine neurons inhibit dopamine release, we found that D2Rs inhibit collateral transmission from indirect to direct pathway neurons. The direct pathway is one of the two functionally opposing output pathways of the striatum. It promotes thalamo-cortical activity, thereby relaying a ?go? signal, whereas the indirect pathway inhibits thalamo-cortical activity, thus relaying a ?no go? signal. We hypothesize that decreased collateral inhibition will enhance direct pathway activity thereby promoting motivated behavior. The same mechanism that regulates synaptic transmission at intrastriatal collaterals should also affect transmission at the main indirect output terminals in the ventral pallidum (VP). We therefore hypothesize that D2Rs in the NAcc enhance motivation via two mechanisms, dis- inhibition of direct pathway activity and inhibition of indirect pathway output. To develop new therapeutic strategies for disorders of motivation it will be crucial to understand how ventral-striatal D2Rs regulate motivation at the molecular level. D2Rs signal via two downstream pathways one that is G-protein dependent and one is G-protein independent and involves arrestin. Here, we will compare the efficiencies of functionally selective D2Rs in their ability to enhance motivation and to inhibit indirect pathway transmission. Since G-protein signaling is required for D2R-mediated inhibition of dopamine release we hypothesize that G-protein but not arrestin signaling is necessary for inhibiting indirect pathway transmission leading to enhanced motivation. Whether decreased indirect pathway transmission disinhibits direct pathway and downstream VP activity is unknown but essential for understanding how D2Rs regulate motivation. We will therefore measure neuronal activity selectively in the VP as well as in the direct or the indirect pathway during motivated behavior. We will use the Cre/loxP system in combination with Cre-dependent viruses to selectively overexpress wild-type or mutated functionally selective D2Rs in the indirect-pathway of the NAcc and employ patch clamp slice physiology, in vivo calcium imaging and a behavioral analysis to address the following aims: Aim 1: To determine the function of NAcc D2Rs in VP inhibition and motivation Aim 2: To identify the signaling pathway(s) by which NAcc D2Rs regulate motivation"
"9505072","Abstract/Summary Cutaneous wounds create significant health problems for Veterans, including wartime trauma, diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and pathological scar formation. We aim to devise novel methods to stimulate self- repair mechanisms and to promote scar-less wound healing/full tissue regeneration in humans. We use a combination of loss-of-function mouse genetics, parabiosis (where the circulatory systems of two mice are surgically connected), mass cytometry, flow cytometry, genomics, lineage tracing, and molecular biology to study ear tissue regeneration in mice. Our prior work and current preliminary data demonstrate that in two different physiologic contexts, skin-secreted SDF1 regulates the switch between scar formation and tissue regeneration. In Aim 1, we will study how SDF1 promotes scarring and fibrosis. The canonical receptor for SDF1 is CXCR4. After injury, we hypothesize that skin-secreted SDF1 recruits CXCR4+ immune cells, which produce paracrine factors that induce fibroblasts to form fibrous tissue and scar. Recruited cell types will be defined and functionally tested. In Aim 2, we translate our findings directly into humans. While pathologic scar formation (keloids and hypertrophic scars) is more common in certain ethnicities, the genetic basis of keloid formation remains unknown. We hypothesize that increased SDF1 promotes formation of human pathologic scars. Indeed, human keloid tissue contains higher amounts of SDF1. We propose to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms in the SDF1 gene of keloid-prone and control patients. Identified polymorphisms will be introduced and functionally tested in an ex vivo human skin organoid system. This proposal seeks to understand how SDF1 regulates wound healing and tissue regeneration and to decipher the genetic basis for pathologic scar formation in humans."
"9465193","SUMMARY Although solid tumors oftentimes arise from the uninhibited growth of a single aberrant cell, the population of cells within a tumor are genetically and molecularly heterogenous. This makes it very difficult to evaluate a therapy?s efficacy when using bulk population measurements. Furthermore, recent research has implicated microRNAs (miRNAs) as drivers of progression and malignancy in many tumor types. MiRNAs, small non- coding RNAs that are typically about 20 nucleotides long, can modulate target gene expression by binding to mRNA, signaling for its degradation or inactivation. The relationship between miRNA and target genes becomes even more complex since miRNAs can target multiple mRNAs, and most of what is known about miRNA targets is theoretical and based on sequence-based predication algorithms. It is the correlation between miRNAs and target protein that therapy developers need to be able to monitor to tell if their therapy is going to be effective for a certain tumor type. The only way to quickly discover accurate correlations between RNA and proteins, is to monitor the transcriptome and proteome on a single cell level. This will tell drug developers, exactly what the relationship is between a specific miRNA and protein of intertest, and in what cell types these correlations are most prevalent. The IsoPlexis Single-Cell Barcode (SCBC) is the only technology that currently exists that can obtain this correlation data from single cells, measuring up to 42 secreted or intracellular proteins along with up to 4 phenotypic surface markers from a single cell making our technology able to measure 10-fold more proteins per cell than our competitors and requires only a few thousand cells to provide significant, and importantly quantitative, results. Our platform has recently been further developed to lyse cells on-chip in a cell specific manner, allowing for the capture of circulating RNA species, including miRNA and mRNA. Herein, we propose to use this phase I grant to develop a new tool, using the IsoPlexis SCBC platform, for multi-omic analysis that can (i) make highly multiplexed measurements from a single cell (ii) while being able to gather both proteomic and transcriptomic data from the same cell (iii) in a manner that is high throughout and capable of being fully automated. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1. Develop and optimize SCBC flow cell for dual capture of protein and RNA on-chip. Aim 2. Deliver validation for ability to monitor multi-omic GBM biomarkers from a single-cell using 10 patient samples in collaboration with UCLA and Caltech."
"9462773","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (PITT-ADRC) has shown a clear scientific evolution over the past three decades. Since our inception, we have advanced the areas of AD neuropsychiatry, the natural history of AD, validation of clinical criteria, and clinico-pathological correlations. We have pioneered new PET techniques for amyloid imaging. We have used a multidisciplinary approach to better understand the transition from normalcy to dementia, have explored the biology of more aggressive forms of AD characterized by psychosis, and have made and contributed to new insights in genetics. This solid scientific background has allowed the PITT-ADRC to develop areas of excellence, which will serve as the basis for the future of the Center. These are reflected in the Center's cores and projects, and most notably in the large number of studies we support in Pittsburgh and at the national and international level. Equally important, the availability of a rich, multidisciplinary training environment along with dedicated, skilled mentoring creates the perfect laboratory to develop and advance young investigators.  With our Projects, we are committed to remain at the forefront of the scientific efforts to understand the pathological processes involved in the etiology of AD. Project-1 takes a comprehensive neuroimaging approach to studying subjective cognitive decline (in the context of personality factors), with a focus on amyloid PET imaging as the putative earliest indicator of AD pathology. Project-2 will combine amyloid PET and tau PET (with T807) to examine fundamental characteristics of the T807 tracer with particular interest in the tau status of cognitively normal control subjects who are amyloid-negative but already show hypometabolism or hippocampal atrophy suggestive of suspected non-amyloid pathophysiology (SNAP).  Project 3 will examine the pathological basis of psychotic symptoms in AD patients, which have a tremendous effect on the quality of life of the patients and their families, and are risk factors for rapid clinical progression of the disease and mortality. The PITT-ADRC, through its pilot projects, engages and involves as many clinical and basic researchers as possible. This extends to all aspects of research relevant to AD and related dementias.  The PITT-ADRC is highly committed to leverage the strengths of the network of centers to provide large numbers of samples and standardized clinical data collection from our participants. The PITT-ADRC has designed novel methodology that improves the accessibility to its database to local and national researchers, and it has been a key player in multiple studies that advanced the understanding of AD pathology and its possible implications for the development of novel treatments and other symptoms. Therefore, we provide an excellent environment that enhances cutting-edge research by bringing together a multidisciplinary team of investigators to study AD and other dementias, and to improve health care delivery."

Golub, MD, an assistant professor of otolaryngology?head and neck surgery at Columbia University Medical Center, with mentored career development to establish an independent research career in the study of the relation of hearing loss (HL) to Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Age-related HL is the third most common chronic condition in older adults and is associated with ADRD, cognitive decline, and brain atrophy. However, the mechanisms underlying these associations are unknown. The goal of this career development award is to advance Dr. Golub?s research career in HL and ADRD by (a) providing mentored career development and training in patient-oriented research (POR); and b) conducting research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the association of HL with ADRD in an ancillary study of an ongoing project, in which the primary mentor, José Luchsinger, is the principal investigator. This project will inform the development of future POR in HL and ADRD. Career development will be provided through an experienced team of mentors spanning the disciplines of aging, geriatrics, neuropsychology, neuroimaging, epidemiology, and otolaryngology. Training will occur in 6 key areas: (1) aging and ADRD; (2) implementing hearing assessments in POR; (3) brain imaging; (4) cognitive testing; (5) biostatistics and epidemiology related to POR in ADRD; (6) professional development. Modes of learning will include meetings with mentors, formal courses in career development, formal courses in epidemiology and biostatistics, seminars in aging and ADRD, training and participation in primary data collection, scientific meetings, and training in the responsible conduct of research. Preliminary studies from the applicant revealed a 70% increased risk of ADRD in the elderly with observed (not measured) HL compared with those without observed HL. The research goal of this award is to examine the associations of objectively measured HL with imaging markers of ADRD and cognitive performance in late middle aged persons. This will be the first step towards elucidating the mechanisms of the association between age-related HL and ADRD. We will accomplish this by adding an audiometric hearing test to an existing longitudinal study of imaging markers of ADRD in late middle age. This study includes longitudinal ascertainment of AD, neurodegeneration, and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) on brain imaging, as well as cognition. AD is ascertained as whole brain amyloid ? with 18F-Florbetaben positron emission tomography (PET). Neurodegeneration is ascertained as tau in inferior and medial temporal lobes with 18F-THK5351 PET, and brain atrophy with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CVD is ascertained as white matter hyperintensities and infarcts on MRI. Cognitive testing includes memory and executive function. We hypothesize that HL is associated with AD, neurodegeneration, and CVD, and these associations mediate the association between HL and worse cognitive performance. The proposed career development activities and research project will help propel a career to clarify whether HL is a cause, consequence, or correlate of ADRD."
"9630409","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive reserve refers to the ability to buffer against brain pathology, including types commonly found post mortem in the brains of people diagnosed with Alzheimer?s disease (e.g., amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles). I hypothesize that reserve is a key reason why some older adults have normal cognitive function despite the presence of neuropathology. Recently, researchers have begun to empirically investigate reserve as the discrepancy between neuropathology and brain function, as measured with cognitive tests. Studies have found a relationship between a disadvantaged early life environment and later life clinical dementia, including Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias. However, it is not known if an advantaged early life is related to greater later life reserve or lower levels of neuropathology itself. As brain development is particularly accelerated through age 5 years, early life could be a sensitive period for cognitive reserve. I propose to use four unique datasets that contain information on early life social environment, later life cognitive tests, and autopsy-based neuropathology measures from geographically diverse study populations: the Adult Changes in Thought Study, the Honolulu Asia Aging Study, the Religious Orders Study, and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. I test the hypotheses that an advantaged early life environment, independently of and synergistically with adult social advantage, is related to greater later life cognitive reserve, even in the presence of significant neuropathology. I will be able to test also whether early life environment is related to actual levels of cognition and neuropathology. My background in demography and epidemiology, including 3 years as a postdoctoral fellow and 5 years as a junior faculty member, prepares me to lead these projects, under the guidance of a team that reflects the leadership of the proposed studies, local experts in neuropathology and epidemiology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, a local expert in the analysis of cognitive measures, and a leading expert in the integration of social and life course epidemiology. The proposed training and research experiences in this project will be integral in building a foundation in the analysis of cognitive outcomes and resilience to dementia, and enhancing the experience of my existing skills in life course and aging epidemiology that will allow me to lead future projects at the intersection of these fields."
"9462570","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Gene therapy is a promising approach to treating Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). However, current methods typically require the addition of extra dystrophin genes to the genome or the lifelong re- administration of foreign genetic material that works transiently to restore dystrophin expression, both of which have significant safety and practical concerns. Furthermore, these strategies have been limited by an inability to deliver the large and complex dystrophin gene sequence. An appealing alternative to these gene replacement approaches is the targeted repair of the endogenous mutant dystrophin gene. This concept, known as genome editing, represents a potential cure to DMD without the need for permanent integration of or repeated exposure to foreign biological material. Furthermore, it corrects the problem at the source by correcting the mutation to the naturally occurring dystrophin gene. Genome editing has been made a reality for human gene therapy by the recent development of transformative technologies that use engineered enzymes to cut and paste DNA sequences at specific sites in the genome. In fact, genome editing is now in clinical trials for treating cancer and HIV. The most recently developed genome editing technology, known as CRISPR, is much more robust than previous technologies and has rapidly transformed all areas of biomedical research and biotechnology in less than two years. Several efforts are underway to use CRISPR to correct genetic diseases, and we have demonstrated that it is possible to restore dystrophin expression in muscle cells from DMD patients. However, for this to be viable for clinical translation, we must demonstrate successful genome editing in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue in animal models of the disease. In this study, we will use adeno- associated virus to delivery CRISPR to skeletal and cardiac muscles of a mouse model of DMD and a mouse model carrying the human dystrophin gene. The overall objective of this research proposal is to develop methods to restore dystrophin expression via targeted genome editing in vivo. The central hypothesis is that nuclease-mediated gene correction will lead proper dystrophin expression and function in mouse models of DMD. This research plan is innovative because it capitalizes on the unfulfilled potential of the CRISPR genome editing technology to address the fundamental limitations of conventional gene therapies and the unmet need for a safe and effective permanent cure to DMD. Importantly, this approach is also broadly applicable to numerous genetic diseases in addition to DMD. Thus in addition to identifying a lead candidate nuclease and delivery method for treatment of DMD, this work will also lead to additional development and refinements of the CRISPR technology to broadly benefit patients affected by hereditary disorders. Finally, the development of technologies for in vivo genome editing in skeletal and cardiac muscle will be broadly useful for biotechnology and basic scientific research."
"9526961","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Africa has the largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world and a rapidly aging population. In recent years, with expanded availability of ART, many adults are aging with HIV, and further, increasing numbers are acquiring HIV at older ages. Despite these population concerns, research on the impact of the HIV epidemic on older South Africans is scarce. The overall goal of HIV after 40 (HIV40) is to examine life course and contextual variation in HIV risk and protective behaviors in a rural sub-Saharan African population among a largely neglected demographic in HIV/AIDS research: adults aged 40-80.  We seek funding to analyze data from the longitudinal Agincourt Health and Socio-Demographic Surveillance System (AHDSS) in rural South Africa and quantitative and qualitative data on HIV and sexual behavior among middle-aged and older adults nested within the AHDSS and collected by our research team. Our innovative and novel integrated multi-method dataset draws on five data sources including: (1) AHDSS data collecting annual censuses of 90,000 people in 27 villages followed from 1992-2014; (2) nested cross- sectional survey data of 5080 individuals (of whom 2080 are aged 40+) on sexual behavior with HIV and chronic disease biomarkers (2010-2011); (3) 60 nested life history interviews with HIV positive and negative adults aged 40-80 (2013); (4) community focus group data from 77 respondents (2013); and (5) key informant interview data from health workers in 3 local health clinics (2013). Guided by an innovative life course approach, we use these data to examine HIV risk and protective behavior in the transition from middle to older ages and the role of social context in shaping individual behavior.  HIV40 is significant in its focus on life course variation and contex in HIV risk and protection in the transition to older ages. It offers cutting edge scientific advancement in the HIV and gerontology literature that will inform approaches to HIV prevention for older adults. It is also innovative in its use of a unique multi-method longitudinal and cross-sectional nested dataset. Our research will be conducted by a strong team of investigators with complementary strengths and collaborative experience working on the substantive areas and methods proposed here. Finally, we expect our work to contribute to and directly impact HIV prevention programming in rural South Africa by leveraging over twenty years of community relationships in Agincourt."
"9459294","Abstract Honoring patient preferences is a keystone of high-quality end-of-life (EOL) care. An important pathway to improve the likelihood of preference-concordant care at EOL is advance care planning (ACP), which has been shown to align treatments with documented patient preferences, as well as have other benefits to quality of care and survivor outcomes. Discussions in which patients express their wishes for EOL care are known as informal ACP (IACP). Most research to date has focused on formal (legal) ACP, or on ACP in older adults exclusively. In contrast, little is known about early IACP: discussions of EOL care preferences that take place in healthy middle age and older people, who are not yet facing imminent health threats. This study will used a mixed methods approach to characterize and document the prevalence of IACP conversations in healthy middle age (55-64) and young-old adults (65-74), focusing on the content and triggers of conversations, describing conversation partners, and identifying the extent to which IACP conversations overlap with other types of age-related planning, such as retirement planning. By focusing on middle age and young-old adults, this research will explore how IACP conversations begin and develop over time, and how health care planning is or is not similar to other conversations or planning people make for older age. Findings may inspire novel interventions to boost rates and quality of IACP, an important pathway to improving EOL care."
"9462092","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emotional distress, including depression and diabetes-specific distress (e.g., feeling overwhelmed by living with diabetes, feelings of failure related to diabetes self-care), is a significant and prevalent problem for patients with type 2 diabetes. Both depression and diabetes distress have been associated with metabolic/glycemic control, diabetes complications, mortality, and quality of life. Recent findings further suggest tht risk for emotional distress is influenced by diabetes treatment. The GRADE study (Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study) is generating prospective data that will provide a unique opportunity to examine the relationships between emotional distress, diabetes treatment, and outcomes in an experimental design. The GRADE study is a randomized clinical trial that will compare the metabolic effects of four common anti-diabetic drugs when combined with metformin. This sub- study will recruit a total of 2,500 patients who are within 10 years of diagnosis and are being treated with metformin monotherapy at the time of enrollment. The study will examine patient-level variation in baseline emotional distress as a predictor of glycemic control and other health outcomes, independent of treatment effects. The study will also provide a rigorous experimental examination of treatment regimen effects on emotional distress over time as part of the"
"9440345","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element in human nutrition due to its presence, in the form of selenocysteine residue, in 25 selenoproteins. Selenoproteins participate in diverse biological processes, but their key roles are to regulate cellular redox homeostasis. These redox activities are modulated by the level and chemical form of dietary Se in a selenoprotein- and organ-specific manner. Selenoprotein status has been implicated in a variety of physiological processes and diseases, but the function of Se that attracted the most attention is its role in cancer. There are numerous studies, including clinical trials, which support the role of Se in cancer prevention, but there are also studies that found no such role. The consensus is that Se may be beneficial under conditions of low Se status, when selenoprotein levels are suboptimal, whereas this micronutrient is not effective in cancer prevention when Se levels are above that needed to saturate selenoprotein expression. Our research revealed a dual role the 15 kDa selenoprotein (Sep15) in cancer. We hypothesize that Sep15 and its homolog selenoprotein M (SelM) serve as redox gatekeepers for disulfide-rich proteins that pass through the endoplasmic reticulum. This hypothesis will be addressed using cell culture and mouse models. We will determine redox targets of Sep15 and SelM, characterize consequences of their deficiency, profile immunoglobulins in selenoprotein knockout mice and examine their maturation status. In addition, we found that high-throughput analyses of selenoproteins in a large panel of human cancer cell lines provides direct insights into the functions of these proteins in the context of human cancer, control of redox homeostasis and dependence of various cancer types on selenoproteins. We will characterize the human selenoproteome and selenocysteine machinery for their roles in human cancer by analyzing coexpression patterns and dependence of various cancer types on selenoproteins and drugs, and will link this information with genotype and expression patterns. This information will define the roles of selenoproteins in human cancer and provide critical information for the development of approaches for personalized use of dietary selenium to modulate cancer prevention and progression. Overall, these studies will provide critical insights into the role of selenium and selenoproteins in cancer."
"9453703","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent racial disparities in neonatal mortality rates are a major public health concern. Black neonates are more than twice as likely to die as white neonates. In previous research in New York City (NYC) hospitals, we found nearly a three-fold variation in risk-adjusted very low birth weight (VLBW) neonatal mortality rates among hospitals and black infants were much more likely to be born at higher mortality hospitals. The factors that influence wide variation in mortality rates among hospitals are not known. Why black women are more likely to deliver at higher mortality hospitals is also unknown. The objectives of this study are: 1) To examine risk- adjusted neonatal mortality among New York City hospitals over the past decade and assess the extent to which variations in hospital quality contribute to VLBW mortality disparities for blacks and Latinos; 2) To use an innovative mixed methods approach to explore processes of care, unit characteristics, patient factors, and organizational factors that explain differences in hospital quality as measured by overall and cause-specific risk-adjusted mortality rates and use of evidence-based practices; 3) To explore patients' perspectives on barriers to receipt of high quality care by exploring barriers to timely care, communication, availability of high risk obstetrics care, knowledge, decision-making regarding delivery hospital, and perception of risk; and 4) To create specific strategies with key stakeholders to promote uptake of best practices at hospitals caring for VLBW infants including patient-centered strategies to minimize barriers to receipt of high quality care. Methods: In Phase 1, we will use NYC Vital Statistics records linked with New York State Discharge Abstract Data to develop a risk-adjusted VLBW neonatal mortality model. We will use this model to rank hospitals based on risk-adjusted mortality. We will then examine the distribution of black, Latino, and white births among hospitals. In Phases 2 and 3 we will use both quantitative and qualitative methods to determine which hospital factors and practice patterns may explain the wide variation in mortality outcomes among hospitals and to explore why black mothers deliver in higher mortality hospitals. We will then convene leaders of obstetrics and neonatologists, hospital quality leaders, community leaders, NYC and State Departments of Health, and patients to discuss our results and explore interventions to improve care for VLBW infants. Information from this study will provide a better understanding of quality in neonatal care in hospitals and reveal specific processes of care that can be improved upon to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in neonatal outcomes."
"9462224","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Engage is a novel therapy for late life depression, a disorder that worsens the outcomes of most medical illnesses, promotes disability, increases expense, and complicates medical care by clouding the clinical picture and undermining treatment adherence. Late-life depression has a modest response to pharmacotherapy, and although problem-solving therapy (PST) was found efficacious, it is rarely utilized by community clinicians. Engage targets behavioral domains of late-life depression grounded on neurobiological constructs using behavioral strategies of known efficacy selected for their simplicity. Reward exposure is the principal treatment vehicle of Engage. The first 3 sessions consist of direct reward exposure but the therapists search for barriers in 3 behavioral domains, i.e. negativity bias, apathy, and emotional dysregulation, and add strategies targeting these domains when needed. Engage uses a structured, stepped-care approach and makes personalization part of the treatment itself. The primary hypothesis of the study is that Engage is non-inferior to problem solving therapy (PST), a treatment with demonstrated efficacy in late life depression. Its secondary hypotheses postulate that Engage requires fewer training hours than PST, is non-inferior to PST in reducing disability and in inducing remission of depression. Exploratory analyses will focus on long-term efficacy of Engage (over 26 and 52 weeks) as well as mechanisms and predictors of its effects. The participants will be 300 (150 from each Center) older (>60 years) non-psychotic, non-demented persons with unipolar major depression who will be randomly assigned to 9 sessions of Engage or PST. We bring to this project two research groups with a history of a successful collaboration in 2 two-center R01 supported psychotherapy studies, complementary expertise in clinical biology, intervention development, clinical trials, and experience in directing multicenter studies. This application responds to two IOM reports, which predict that the workforce in geriatrics will be overwhelmed by the aging population, a problem that will reach cataclysmic proportions when the Affordable Care Programs come into being. Older adults seek services in community settings where the providers of initial care for depression are social workers and nurses without in-depth training in psychotherapies. Engage is designed for such clinicians and, therefore, may have broad scalability (used by many professionals) and reach by offering to many depressed seniors access to effective psychotherapy. The stepped approach to personalization used by Engage may make it applicable to other populations."
"9433617","The reduced bone density and quality that occur in osteoporosis and the associated fracture risk is a major clinical problem in the aged population. Current therapies are aimed at modulating osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation to maintain bone mass and until recently the osteocyte was overlooked. However, osteocytes are now known to be key regulators of bone mass through controlling the activity of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. An exciting new paradigm in cell-cell communication is that extracellular vesicles (EV) (exosomes and microvesicles) may provide a novel mechanism for commun- ication between cells. These are membrane-bound particles shed from cells that carry a cargo of proteins, mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs). They dock with a target cell, delivering their cargo and altering the function of the target cell. Using a novel transgenic mouse expressing a membrane-targeted GFP in osteocytes, our preliminary live cell imaging data has shown that embedding osteocytes release EV from their cell body and dendrites. We have isolated EV from osteocyte-like cell lines and shown that they contain protein, mRNA and miRNA cargo, are enriched for sclerostin and contain RANKL. These EV have potent effects on osteoblasts to induce differentiation towards an osteocyte phenotype. Based on these novel observations, the overall hypothesis for the proposed studies is that osteocyte derived extracellular vesicles (EV) provide a novel mechanism for regulation of osteoblast and osteoclast function and potentially for molecular crosstalk with cells at distant sites from bone. This exploratory R21 will test this hypothesis using complimentary in vitro and in vivo approaches. Aim 1 will determine the role of osteocyte EV in regulating osteoblast and osteoclast function. EV will be isolated from osteocyte cell lines and their effects in in vitro assays of osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation determined. Live cell imaging will determine the kinetics of EV uptake in osteoblasts and osteoclasts and siRNA and miRNA hairpin Inhibitors will be used to define the mediators of EV effects. In vivo experiments will be performed in mice to confirm the functional effects of osteocyte EV on bone cells in vivo. Aim 2 will use intravital imaging in mice expressing a membrane targeted GFP in osteocytes and DsRed or TdTomato reporters in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. We will determine the dynamics of osteocyte EV release in vivo, whether the EV are shed into the circulation and/or released from bone matrix during bone resorption. Aim 3 will examine whether osteocyte EV provide a mechanism for signal propagation by transferring gene expression changes induced by stimuli such as PTH and oxidative stress to a naïve cell population. Proteomics and miRNA profiling will define the cargo of osteocyte EV and its regulation by PTH. These studies may shift paradigms about cell-cell communication in bone and pave the way for exploiting osteocyte EVs as circulating biomarkers and novel therapeutics for diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis and other bone diseases."
"9522328","Project Summary Dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) provide essential modulatory signals to the forebrain limbic system and cortex to facilitate learning and motivational processes. Disruptions in dopamine signaling are broadly implicated in mental illness and likely contribute to a spectrum of behavioral dysfunction through distinct cortico-limbic pathways. The heterogeneity of dopamine neurons in the VTA has long been appreciated, but therapeutic strategies targeting the system are still based on a monolithic perspective. Recent advances in mapping the input/output relationships of distinct dopamine pathways have attempted to resolve the basic organization of the VTA, but have yielded little in the way of establishing how specialized subdivisions might be organized. Unraveling the basic anatomical and functional organization of the VTA is essential if precision therapeutics are to be achieved for treating specific behavioral dysfunctions. We hypothesized that the dopamine system in the VTA can be organized based on peptidergic modulation to gate information through specific output pathways. We have mapped the projections of dopamine neurons in the VTA that express distinct neuropeptide receptors and discovered a remarkable specialization of these outputs. Here we propose to establish the basic electrophysiological, anatomical, and behavioral function of these pathways using novel Cre driver mouse lines in combination with advanced techniques in viral-based circuit dissection. We will also establish novel methods for the genetic characterization of these subpopulations. Successful completion of our proposed aims will provide novel insight into the basic organization of the VTA dopamine system and establish a framework for cracking the dopamine code."
"9458252","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have designed neuronal Protective Nanoparticles (Pro-NPs) with a unique composition containing antioxidant enzymes that are released in active form over a sustained period of time. Our goal is to test their efficacy for treating acute spinal cord injury (SCI). Disability due to SCI is a major global health issue, affecting mainly the young population. Nearly 1.3 million people in the US are living with paralysis due to SCI, and it costs $40.5 billion annually for their care. At present, there is no effective treatment that can achieve functional recovery following SCI. The pathophysiology of traumatic SCI involves the initial physical impact, which leads to secondary injury cascades of degenerative cellular and molecular events. The secondary injury spreads along the spinal cord over time, which adds new levels of disability and has devastating effects. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation at the impact site is an important component of these secondary injury cascades. We hypothesize that efficient and sustained delivery of antioxidants to the lesion site could alleviat the oxidative stress-mediated degenerative events following SCI and promote endogenous neuronal repair mechanisms, leading to recovery of locomotors, neurological, and physiological functions. In preliminary studies in a thoracic rat model of traumatic SCI, we demonstrated that following intravenous administration at 3 hr. post-injury, Pro-NPs pass through the disrupted blood-spinal cord barrier and localize in the lesion cavity and are significantly effective in restoring locomotors functions with a single dose whereas control animals (untreated, enzymes alone or empty NPs) remain paraplegic. Our main objectives in this proposal are both translational and basic, and are a) to demonstrate robust preclinical efficacy with Pro-NPs under clinically relevant conditions in the above animal model of SCI and b) to improve our mechanistic understanding of the treatment, particularly to determine how Pro-NPs inhibit the secondary injury cascade and promote endogenous neuronal repair mechanisms. The specific aims are: AIM 1: Delineate parameters critical for Pro-NP delivery to the lesion site. AIM 2: Determine functional recovery following treatment. AIM 3: Understand the repair mechanisms at molecular and cellular levels. If we validate our hypothesis, the most significant result of our study would be a better mechanistic understanding of neuronal repair facilitated with Pro-NPs that could also have potential impact in treating other traumatic CNS injuries."
"9558006","ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Globally, there are 15 million stroke survivors each year who have significant neurological deficits including sensory and motor disability, leading to excessive socioeconomic burden. Cell therapy using primary MSCs has been actively explored by us and others as a therapeutic solution to this unmet medical need. However, since the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs has been shown to be dependent on intercellular communication between administered cells and brain parenchyma, we reasoned that the exosomes (nanoscale extracellular vesicles) that cells secrete to transmit this information could be used instead of and perhaps more efficiently than the cells themselves. Indeed, we were the first to report that systemic delivery of exosomes released by mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to rats subjected to stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI) substantially improves recovery of neurological function. A key rationale for using exosomes is that they obviate many of the risks associated with cell therapy because their use concentrates the active component of stem cells in a simpler compact non-replicative form. Importantly, they can cross the BBB allowing systemic delivery for treating the injured brain. Moreover, exosomes have low risk of immune rejection and are likely to be more cost-effective to produce and convenient to use and store and thus have potential for an ?off- the-shelf? treatment. However, there are significant roadblocks to translation of our preclinical results using MSC exosomes because of inherent limitations of MSCs for industrial scale production. MSCs are a poorly defined heterogeneous cell population with low proliferative capacity which can hinder batch consistency and limit scale- up for exosome production. Thus to overcome these roadblocks, we propose here to use exosomes derived from BioTime?s clonally pure PureStem® progenitor cell lines, which have a high degree of homogeneity and are highly proliferative and regenerative because of their early embryonic origin. The goal of this phase I proposal is to conduct a feasibility study that would demonstrate neurological recovery in our rat stroke model using PureStem exosomes. We propose to identify 2 PureStem derived candidate exosomes based on angiogenic activity and micro RNA and protein content because increasing angiogenesis in the ischemic brain facilitates improvement of neurological function after stroke. The 2 lead candidates will be tested for efficacy measured by neurological function in our rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Evidence of feasibility using our well-established model to mimic human stroke and using exosomes from a scalable PureStem cell line will pave the way for further preclinical development and IND enabling studies in phase II."
"9520140","Core Summary/Abstract The UC San Diego Superfund Research Center (SRC) will investigate relationships linking obesity, nutrition, genetics, epigenetics and environmental toxicant exposure in the etiology and progression of liver disease, especially a non-alcoholic toxicant induced form of fatty liver disease called Toxicant-Associated Steatohepatitis (TASH). This focus is especially significant now given how cases of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma are dramatically increasing around the world, including in California and Mexico. Hispanic and Native Americans are especially vulnerable to this disease given their genetic susceptibility compounded by the harsh reality that many Hispanic and Native Americans live in stressed places with high rates of obesity, poverty, poor nutrition, health disparities and exposure to toxicants, all of which constitute cumulative impacts that increase the risk of getting cancer, including TASH. UC San Diego?s SRC is pursuing an innovative approach to understanding fatty liver disease and cancer. The Research Translation Core (RTC) will collaborate with all of the SRC project/core leaders to translate their scientific knowledge, data, models and technological innovations into forms useful for our target audiences?including the EPA, ATSDR, CDC, Nonprofits, Biotech, County health providers, city planning organizations, Tribal Environmental Agencies, the NIEHS and other SRCs. The RTC has access to urban and rural sites in California (San Diego and Imperial Valley), including the Halaco Superfund site, and Mexico (Tijuana) where place-based interventions are underway to reduce cumulative risks and health disparities impacting Hispanic and Native American communities. Our communication strategies, partnerships with government agencies, technology transfer and information dissemination to appropriate audiences will concentrate on toxicant induced liver disease from a perspective of prevention and intervention. We will identify and share new models of exposure (e.g., 3D printed liver tissue), methods of detection and diagnosis (e.g., Synthetically Evolved Receptors and Synthetically Evolved Biosensors), novel plant technologies (enhanced phytostabilization and bioremediation potential of plants and edible food safety) and new online cyberinfrastructure for data integration, visualization and mapping. The RTC will facilitate joint publications among project/core leaders and extend the reach of our science communication through social media, webinars, press releases, symposia, science cafes, geographic information systems and bioinformatics. This multidisciplinary team research will promote knowledge and understanding of how cumulative risks (e.g., obesity, poor nutrition, and exposure to toxicants) impact human health; thereby helping pave the way for better detection and diagnosis, prevention and interventions that can slow the rate of increase in toxicant induced liver disease."
"9433683","PROJECT SUMMARY Elucidating the molecular changes that underlie depression and associated symptoms in Bipolar Disorder?I (BD) is critical for diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy. BD is a devastating illness with a lifetime prevalence of 1%. Within BD, depression is the most common and most frequent presenting episode type, and is associated with a high risk of suicide. Unfortunately, currently available pharmacotherapies are not able to provide effective relief to a large portion of individuals with BD, and do not normalize the observed deficits in cognitive functioning in the disorder. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify novel molecular sites, which may prove as treatment targets to reduce the burden of depression and cognitive dysfunction in BD. Significant evidence suggests heightened inflammatory tone in BD, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disorder. For example, peripheral markers of inflammation are higher in individuals with BD as compared to controls and individuals with BD have higher prevalence of inflammatory disorders such as heart disease. Furthermore, elevated peripheral inflammatory markers appear to subserve some of the cognitive deficits observed in BD, for which currently there are no targeted treatments. It was previously thought that the brain and peripheral immune system were isolated by the blood-brain-barrier, but we now know that cytokines in the periphery can enter the brain, lead to changes in behavior and initiate a central inflammatory response. In response to signals from the periphery and damaging stimuli, microglial cells become activated and, in their pro-inflammatory state may lead to neuro- and excitotoxicity. Unfortunately, investigation of inflammatory factors in the brains of individuals with BD is limited. However, the existing evidence from postmortem studies and one in vivo imaging study of euthymic individuals with BD supports the hypothesis of elevated neuroinflammatory factors in BD, which can lead to neuronal damage. We propose a novel and critical examination of microglial activation in BD depression using [11C]PBR28 ? a radioligand with high specificity for the Translocator Protein (TSPO), which is upregulated in activated microglia and used as a marker of neuroinflammation. We will scan 15 individuals with BD-Dep and 15 healthy control individuals with to identify whether there is increased neuroinflammation in BD-Dep. We previously showed that [11C]PBR28 is able to detect changes in neuroinflammation following a peripheral immune challenge and is thus an excellent tool to detect neuroinflammation in BD. Importantly, we will address the question of whether the hypothesized increased neuroinflammation in BD is associated with the depressive symptomatology and cognitive deficits in individuals with BD-Dep. We hypothesize that individuals with the greatest degree of neuroinflammation will exhibit more severe depressive symptoms and have the strongest cognitive deficits in executive control, memory, and attention. These results may lead to a breakthrough in the characterization of BD-Dep and the neurobiological basis of its symptoms, which may benefit from treatments with anti-inflammatory agents."
"9439822","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High rates of suicide are endemic in American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) young adults. A recent study found that rates for young AI/AN adults in the Northern Plains and in Alaska are more than 4 times higher than for Whites of the same age in the same regions. Building social connections is a key goal of suicide prevention. One validated theoretical model asserts that belonging to a group is a fundamental human need. When this need is thwarted by social isolation or inadequate social support, a desire for death emerges. Studies of suicide prevention in AI/ANs underscore the cultural importance of connection to friends, family, caring neighbors, and community leaders. These traditions of community cohesion can be leveraged to protect young AI/AN adults against suicidal ideation and behavior. Caring Contacts is a suicide prevention program that supplements standard care by promoting human connectedness. People at risk for suicide often lose contact with the healthcare system and receive no follow-up care. For 1 year after an initial presentation, Caring Contacts seeks out such individuals to send messages expressing care, concern, and interest. It is the only intervention shown to prevent suicide in any population in a randomized, controlled trial. Based on an almost two year collaborative process with four tribal partners as part of a pilot grant, we have designed a locally feasible, culturally appropriate Caring Contacts intervention that will use text messaging, the dominant communication method for young AI/AN adults. This study uses a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate this approach to suicide prevention in 1,200 high-risk AI/ANs aged 18-34 from our four partner communities. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Compare the effectiveness of usual care (control) to the control condition plus caring text messages (intervention) for reducing suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide- related hospitalizations. 2) Evaluate social connectedness as a mediating factor for the effect of Caring Contacts via text message on suicidality. The US Surgeon General's National Strategy for Suicide Prevention identifies connectedness to others as the primary protective factor against suicidality.53 By adapting and disseminating the Caring Contacts approach, which has demonstrated effectiveness in non-Native populations, our study will evaluate a low-cost, sustainable intervention for addressing the profound disparity of suicide risk experienced by young adult AI/ANs."
"9444826","7. PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral deposition of amyloid-beta peptides is a key mechanism in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Experimental models show that the sleep-wake cycle may regulate amyloid-beta levels, suggesting that poor sleep quality may affect the pathophysiological mechanisms of amyloid-beta deposition. Sleep changes dramatically throughout the lifespan. With age, it becomes more fragmented, declines in the quantity and quality of deep stages and there is an increase in the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The goals of our funded R01 are to test how sleep quality and severity of OSA lead to amyloid deposition. In the first 4 years of our current funding we have made excellent progress in addressing these goals. So far, we have enrolled 192 healthy elderly in a 2-year longitudinal study that includes home sleep-monitoring, brain MRIs and a lumbar puncture (LP) done at baseline and follow-up. In addition, we obtained home sleep measurements in a group of subjects with available PiB-PET scans as well as in-lab NPSG recordings in a subset with available CSF. We found: a) lower slow wave sleep (SWS) duration and lower slow wave activity (SWA) associated with high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A?42 levels at cross-section; b) a high prevalence of OSA in the absence of excessive daytime sleepiness, history of cardiovascular events or cognitive impairment; and, c) severity of OSA associated with longitudinal decreases in CSF A?42 and increases in PiB-PET SUVR uptake. Such changes are potentially consistent with longitudinal increases in brain amyloid burden, suggesting that disrupted sleep, very common in our cohort, contributes to amyloid deposition in healthy elderly. In this competitive renewal, we will extend our prior work by adding new follow-ups (baseline and 24 months) to a group of normal sleep breathing controls and mild-to-moderate OSA subjects retained in the cohort (planned n=112 including attrition rates). All subjects will receive a structural 3T MRI, 2 nights of NPSGs and an amyloid 18F-florbetaben (FBB) PET-MR scan in both visits. The goals of this study are: 1) to examine the direct contribution of age-related SWS loss on longitudinal changes in amyloid deposition; and, 2) to examine the longitudinal effects of mild-to-moderate OSA on amyloid deposition. This novel proposal may identify: i) a relationship between sleep disturbances and longitudinal increase in amyloid burden; ii) enhancement of SWS and treatment of OSA as novel therapeutic targets for AD prevention."
"9470809","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nutrition and infection are key determinants of child growth and survival. Chronic inflammation, which results in part from an increased lifetime burden of infectious disease, is an underlying determinant of adult cardiometabolic disease. The modifiability of this risk by improving nutrition in early life is unknown. Our principal objectiveis to determine whether improvements in early-life nutrition can attenuate the development of cardiometabolic risk. We will collect new data from the INCAP (Guatemala) Nutrition Supplementation Trial cohort. From 1969-77, 2392 children received atole, a high protein and calorie supplement, or fresco, a low calorie drink, for up to 8 y. Children who received atole in the first 3 y of life grew better in childhood and recovered more quickly from diarrheal illness episodes than did children who received fresco. We have followed this cohort prospectively. We propose to re-contact the surviving members of the cohort. The cohort will be 38-53 y old, an ideal age to assess cardiometabolic risk. We will conduct clinical examinations, including (for the first time in this cohort) collection of biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk. We will assay the samples for established and novel biomarkers, including highly innovative metabolomic profiling. We will update and enhance the extensive life-course data that we collected in previous surveys. We will link the new data to our existing rich database to address critical questions regarding the long-term effects on cardiometabolic health of both chronic under-nutrition and an effective intervention to combat under-nutrition, in the context of a community-randomized trial that controls for otherwise intractable questions of endogeneity. The study will be unique in its ability to address unanswered questions relating to early life determinants of adult health. This prospectively-studied cohort has reached an age where the prevalence of cardiometabolic risk is non-negligible. The highly productive research team has extensive experience with survey work among this cohort, demonstrated capacity to link data across study waves, and extensive experience with the appropriate field methods, laboratory methods, and statistical approaches to data analysis. The resulting extensive repository of data and samples will enhance the value of the cohort for future research. Taken together, these elements ensure that the study will be well positioned to successfully address critical understudied questions in human health and development."
"9454255","PROJECT SUMMARY  Pathology stemming from excess ectopic bone formation, or trauma-induced heterotopic ossification (HO), presents a substantial barrier to recovery in 20% of patients with hip replacements, musculoskeletal trauma, spinal cord injury, amputations and burn injuries. Patients with HO experience chronic pain, restricted joint function, and open wounds; they often undergo surgical procedures to excise the offending bone, but these procedures fail to reverse the joint contractures and restricted range of motion. Even after a successful excision procedure, recurrence is common. With these current limitations in our understanding of HO and our inability to prevent its development, we set out to clarify the cells responsible and primary signaling pathways involved. Furthermore, we plan to validate a novel cell specific drug delivery system to block secretion of a primary ligand (Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2) from a primary cell (macrophage) responsible for inducing HO.  Analysis of patients at high risk for HO and of our burn/tenotomy HO model have demonstrated an increase in Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1alpha (HIF-1?) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 (BMP2) signaling. However, where the BMP2 ligand originates and how to block its effect without causing off-target effects is unknown. Additionally, our data show that macrophages play a central role in HO and further studies are needed to elucidate how they are recruited and what ligands they secrete when they traffic to the injury site. The following aims are to test our hypothesis that that inhibition of mesenchymal cell HIF-1? mediated macrophage recruitment or inhibition of macrophage Bmp2 expression will prevent trauma-induced HO. Aim 1: To demonstrate that genetic loss of Hif1a reduces SDF1 production by mesenchymal cells and macrophage infiltration after injury. This aim will demonstrate that Hif-1?-mediated production of SDF-1 by mesenchymal cells at the injury site is responsible for macrophage recruitment immediately following injury. Aim 2: To define the role of macrophage recruitment and macrophage-specific production of BMP2 on HO. This aim will demonstrate that macrophage migration to the injury site and macrophage production of BMP2 is critical for ectopic mesenchymal cell chondrogenesis and heterotopic ossification. Aim 3: To demonstrate that novel microparticles can be used to silence genes specifically in macrophages. This aim will optimize microparticles for macrophage-specific uptake and drug delivery to administer Bmp2 siRNA."

"9465233","Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a group of complex neurodevelopmental disorders that affect 1 in 68 children in the United States. The severity and symptoms of ASD cases vary greatly, but the disorder is characterized by social impairment and repetitive behaviors. ASD represents a major health burden as there is currently no cure and treatments rely on intensive behavioral interventions which have varying efficacy. There is no known single cause for ASD, but it is clear that there are strong genetic and environmental components to the development of the disorder. Recent studies implicated the regulation of gene transcription as a crucial process in the etiology of ASD. Our previous findings identify the bromodomain and extraterminal domain containing (BET) proteins, as epigenetic regulators of neuronal and synaptic genes involved in ASD-like behaviors in mice. We found that the pharmacological suppression of BET proteins in the brain of young mice, leads to selective suppression of neuronal gene expression followed by the development of an autism-like syndrome. Many of the BET-dependent genes have been identified as risk factors for ASD in humans, suggesting a key role of the BET-controlled gene network in the disorder. In this proposal, I will address the biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which BETs, and specifically Brd4, regulate the transcription of neuronal genes implicated in ASD and the development of abnormal social behaviors. These studies will elucidate how impaired gene transcription can lead to abnormal brain development and thus inform our understanding of ASD etiology."
"9476888","Project Summary The goal of this research is to discover the best methods to improve cognition and the ability to perform important everyday activities of older adults suffering from age-related cognitive decline using technology- based cognitive interventions. Any successful cognitive aging intervention must satisfy two requirements: 1) the intervention must effectively and efficiently improve cognitive abilities necessary for important activities required for independent living, and 2) the intervention must be one that older adults are able and willing to engage in. When either of these requirements is not met an intervention is likely to fail. Study 1 aims to assess the comparative effectiveness of technology-delivered narrow and broad interventions designed to improve cognition and support functional independence. Before and after training a variety of outcome measures will be assessed. A sub-goal of this study is to create indices of functional abilities whose failure could be catastrophic to older adults; therefore we adopt a focus on simulated versions of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). We will also assess whether individual differences mediate or moderate cognitive intervention efficiency. This study will contribute to fundamental knowledge about intervention approaches, as well as contribute to theories of intervention efficiency. Study 2 will investigate technology- based intervention adherence. An intervention that an older adult does not adhere to will not have the desired outcome. Older adults will be asked to adhere to a technology-based cognitive intervention and we will explore the predictions of several technology adoption and medical adherence models applied to this domain, as well as apply a novel temporal-discounting framework to explore the amount of time older adults are willing to invest in training to obtain benefits in the future. This study will provide guidelines and a model of adherence so that technology-based interventions can be designed that promote adherence. The sum of the results from the two proposed studies of the FSU project will provide guidelines for designing targeted, individualized training that effectively improves cognition and IADL performance while also ensuring that maximum benefits are obtained by promoting intervention adherence."
"9521236","PROJECT SUMMARY  Approximately 10% of couples trying to become pregnant will not conceive after 12 months. The resulting infertility diagnosis and treatment regimen can be overwhelming to patients. Studies have shown that up to 60% of enrollees will discontinue treatment before achieving a pregnancy; they often cite physical and emotional burden, logistical concerns with repeated clinic visits, and cost as reasons for ending their treatment. At-home diagnostic tests that measure key reproductive endocrinology biomarkers have the potential to remove many of these burdens. Unfortunately, existing at-home tests provide clinical utility to very limited use-cases because: 1) they only measure one or two relevant biomarkers; 2) they require qualitative/subjective analysis; 3) they return results too slowly.  In this research, we propose the development of Barcode Embedded Rapid Diagnostic Tests (BERDTs) as an at-home test to measure fertility hormones in urine . These tests have novel spatial patterning of reagents that allows them to be automatically and quantitatively analyzed by a mobile phone application. Once results are determined on the patient?s phone, the application can provide clinical decision support as well as securely share the test results with the patient?s clinician through electronic medical records (EMR).  We have assembled an interdisciplinary consortium that consists of biomedical engineering, point-of-care device, and software development expertise (PragmaDx, Inc.), biomarker assay development in the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University, and clinical reproductive endocrinology and infertility expertise at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. To meet our shared goals, our specific aims will: optimize manufacturing conditions, develop and evaluate mobile-phone and server-side software, and rigorously compare the performance of BERDTs to standard clinical laboratory methods using de-identified patient specimens.  A successful outcome of this Phase I SBIR will be the development of a diagnostic test and mobile phone software that is capable of measuring multiple hormones in urine at the point-of-care, with accuracy comparable to standard clinical laboratory assays. It will be ready for a rigorous clinical evaluation, which will be the subject of a Phase II SBIR application."
"9461463","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapies to improve health and increase longevity rely on plasticity--or changeability in phenotype--in age- related traits and lifespan. There is growing awareness that phenotypic plasticity may occur not only in an individual, but also across generations. Such transgenerational phenotypic plasticity, known as maternal effects, occurs when the maternal response to the environment causes a change in offspring phenotype without a corresponding change in the genome. Previous studies have focused on detrimental maternal effects like smoking and alcohol consumption, but little is known about the role of beneficial maternal effects on aging. This project will characterize the effects of maternal age and maternal caloric restriction, also known as food limitation, on offspring aging, and will uncover the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms behind maternal effects that improve offspring health and longevity. The central hypothesis is that interventions to improve maternal health and longevity will benefit offspring, and that therapeutic interventions to mothers will offset the negative effects on offspring of advanced maternal age. These maternal effects will be driven by epigenetic mechanisms causing changes in gene expression. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the mechanisms of beneficial maternal effects on aging and health in offspring in order to identify potential gene targets for therapies to improve human health during aging. Dr. Gribble will determine the effect of maternal age and caloric restriction on the health, fecundity, and longevity of offspring, and the persistence of maternal effects through multiple generations using life table experiments and stress-resistance assays (Aim 1); characterize the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying maternal caloric restriction effects, and determine whether this intervention works through the same mechanisms in maternal and filial generations using RNA- Seq, qPCR and RNAi (Aim 2); and define how epigenetic mechanisms are employed transgenerationally to regulate offspring health and longevity in response to maternal environment, using assays for epigenetic histone modifications and ChIP-qPCR (Aim 3). In keeping with the NIA's goal of increasing the variety of model systems available to investigate questions of human health, this project will advance the development of invertebrate monogonont rotifers as a modern model system for the study of aging. Rotifers provide many advantages as models in aging research, including a century of aging-related and maternal effects research; a three-week lifespan enabling high replication and rapid experimentation; asexual (clonal) and sexual propagation; and genetic resources including draft genomes, transcriptomes, and protocols for transgenics and RNAi. The combination of coursework, professional meetings, and direct work with mentors outlined in this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will provide Dr. Gribble with the additional training she needs for a successful research career in the biology of aging. This research will form the basis for future investigation of specific genetic and epigenetic factors involved in beneficial maternal effects."
"9428890","Project Summary Cancer screening is a complex, multi-step process where benefits are maximized when each step is completed successfully, but where sub-optimal outcomes are frequent as a result of breakdowns that can happen at any point in this process. Screening is also impacted by factors beyond simply individual patients?including factors at the provider-, practice-, and health plan/institution-level?and these so-called systems level factors can impact the appropriate delivery of high quality cancer screening services. PROSPR was established to address a number of critical questions related to the delivery of cancer screening in the United States, and our PROSPR I Statistical Coordinating Center was central to many of the successes of this initiative including: 1) Developing a trans-organ conceptual model of cancer screening processes, 2) Creating common data elements and screening performance metrics, 3) Evaluating individual and systems-level factors impacting screening performance, 4) Authorship and statistical support on 21 trans-network published papers, 2 under review, and 17 in preparation; and 5) Establishing PROSPR data repositories and creating an infrastructure for publicly sharing PROSPR data. Our PCC team has considerable expertise both in the leadership of large coordinating centers and in each of the scientific fields relevant to PROSPR including health services/health care delivery, implementation science, cancer epidemiology, health disparities research, biostatistics, bioinformatics/health information technology, and the screening of colorectal, cervical, and lung cancers. Thus, we are uniquely positioned to successfully execute all components of this coordinating center. The specific aims of our PCC are to: 1) Provide administrative coordination for the PROSPR network and guidance in the development of PROSPR?s governance, organization, and policies/procedures; 2) Lead the development of common conceptualization and measures for: A. Assessing the role of systems-level factors that impact the screening process. B. Assessing screening quality; 3) Facilitate trans-PROSPR research comparing the screening process across at least 2 organ sites; and 4) Develop and implement processes and procedures to share PROSPR data with qualified investigators outside of the PROSPR network. RELEVANCE: Improving both the screening process and screening quality for cervical, colorectal, and lung cancers will reduce mortality, morbidity, and health care costs associated with these cancers in the United States."
"9531109","Project Summary/Abstract Chronic pain and itch (pruritis) drastically impact every aspect of daily function, often hindering work performance and severely impairing quality of life. Current treatments aimed at alleviating these conditions have serious side effects and lack sufficient efficacy for long-term use. Characterizing the molecular mechanisms by which noxious stimuli are processed may reveal candidate molecules to target with novel pharmacological treatments. Pain- and itch-sensing neurons whose cell bodies lie in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) detect algogenic (pain-causing) and pruritogenic (itch-causing) stimuli in peripheral tissues and transmit the signal to the spinal cord, then to the brain. Signaling mediators released after injury or in the context of skin disorders both activate DRG neurons, leading to the perception of pain and itch, and sensitize these neurons, causing enhanced responses upon further stimulation. The signaling molecules that contribute to this sensitization activate receptors that yield diacylglycerol (DAG) production in the DRG. DAG can be converted into monoacylglycerol (MAG). DAG and MAG affect activity of DRG neurons by directly modulating receptor activity, activating secondary messengers that alter signaling, and acting as precursors to downstream metabolites that affect pain and itch. I have discovered that diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) can phosphorylate MAG in addition to phosphorylating DAG. Altering levels of DAG, MAG, or their metabolites has been shown to cause differences in pain signaling. Therefore, I am interested in determining if DGK?s phosphorylation of DAG and MAG can alter lipid levels in peripheral sensory neurons and lead to changes in itch and pain. I am investigating the DGK isoform iota (DGK?) that I found to be highly expressed in the pain- and itch-sensing DRG neurons of mice and humans. I hypothesize that DGK? kinase activity regulates levels of signaling lipids in DRG neurons, mediating somatosensory signaling. Using a DGK? knockout mouse, I have confirmed that kinase activity on both DAG and MAG is reduced in DRG neurons. Preliminary experiments with these mice show that sensitivity to pruritogens is enhanced by the loss of DGK?. To determine how alterations in lipid levels contributes to somatosensory phenotypes, I will use mass spectrometry to compare levels of DAG, MAG, and related signaling lipids in neuronal tissue between wild type and DGK?-/- mice. I will further examine sensitivity to itch in vivo using acute exposure to pruritogens. Additionally, I will examine pain sensitivity to noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli in DGK? knockout mice. Mice will be sensitized via inflammatory and neuropathic injury, and the severity of sensitization and recovery will be measured. Furthermore, I will investigate calcium responses to algogenic and pruritogenic stimuli that activate receptors regulated by these lipid signaling molecules in the DRG. In vitro signaling experiments and in vivo behavioral assays coupled with lipidomic analyses will help me characterize the role of DGK? in somatosensation and discover the potential of this kinase as targets for pain and itch therapies."
"9441729","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. and remains a largely intractable disease. Nearly all cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(PDAC) are characterized by activating mutations in the Kras gene. Attempts at pharmacological inhibition of Kras and its downstream signaling effectors in PDAC have so far been unsuccessful. Cancer cell metabolism has become a new area of interest for the development of targeted therapies. Through activation of various signaling pathways, oncogenic Kras induces a metabolic transformation that makes pancreatic cancer cells more reliant on glycolysis and less reliant on mitochondria-based metabolism. The proposed study focuses on Nix, a protein involved in mitochondrial maintenance and turnover, which might be responsible for the metabolic transformation seen in Kras-mutant cells. Our preliminary studies show that Nix is upregulated at the RNA and protein levels in murine pancreatic tumors. Additionally, ablation of Nix or Kras leads to a decrease in the number of mitochondria and the proliferative capacity of Kras-mutant, but not Kras wild-type, cancer cells. These results suggest the exciting possibility that Nix might be a legitimate drug target for the treatment of Kras-mutant pancreatic cancer. The proposed study will further elucidate the role of Nix in pancreatic cancer using genetically engineered mouse models and a novel pancreatic ductal organoid culture system. First, we will evaluate the metabolic consequences of Nix ablation using the organoid system. For the first time in vitro, this system will allow us to compare the metabolic phenotype of normal, pre-neoplastic and neoplastic pancreatic cells expressing or lacking Nix. Second, we will determine the role of Nix in pancreatic tumor intiation and maintenance using genetically engineered mouse models and an orthotopically transplanted organoid mouse model (respectively). We have crossed mice expressing a conditional Nix allele into our KPC mouse model, characterized by pancreas- specific expression of mutant Kras and mutant p53, to study the effects of Nix on pancreatic tumorigenesis. To study PDAC maintenance, we will transplant organoids infected with inducible short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting Nix into the pancreata of wildtype mice. These shRNAs will be induced after tumor formation in vivo to assess the effects of Nix knockdown on tumor maintenance. Results from these studies will not only validate the legitimacy of Nix as a suitable drug target for pancreatic cancer, but will also elucidate the role of Nix in the metaboli transformation of pancreatic cancer to provide a better understanding of this therapeutic target."
"9545363","Project Summary / Abstract (30-line maximum). A majority of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) cases occur in the cervical spinal cord, resulting in persistent diaphragmatic respiratory dysfunction that is associated with mortality, a host of morbidities such as respiratory infections, and greatly reduced quality of life. Diaphragm is directly controlled by phrenic motor neurons (PMNs) located at levels C3-5. PMNs are mono-synaptically activated by supraspinal brainstem neurons located in the rostral Ventral Respiratory Group (rVRG). Cervical SCI results in axotomy of descending rVRG fibers, denervation and silencing of spared PMNs, and partial-to-complete hemi-diaphragm paralysis.  In this Competing Continuation (?Renewal?) application, we aim to promote reconnection of rVRG-PMN- diaphragm circuitry in a rat model of cervical SCI, a critically important therapeutic goal for individuals with SCI.  We developed inhibitory peptides against PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog: a central inhibitor of neuron-intrinsic axon growth potential) and PTP? (protein tyrosine phosphatase-sigma: an axonally-expressed receptor that mediates the neuron-extrinsic axon growth inhibitory effects of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans). Our exciting preliminary findings show that systemic delivery of these peptides each result in robust ? but partial ? recovery of diaphragm function in the C2 hemisection model of SCI. These initial studies also provide compelling data suggesting that PTEN and PTP? inhibition may promote recovery via different modes of rVRG axon growth: (1) robust regeneration of injured ipsilateral rVRG axons with PTEN inhibition; (2) extensive sprouting of spared contralateral rVRG axons into the PMN pool (ipsilateral to the lesion) with PTP? inhibition.  Importantly, we do not understand which modes of axon growth can promote recovery of diaphragm function after SCI, which significantly limits ability to develop targeted therapies. To address this critical issue, we will use chemogenetic DREAAD manipulations to selectively-silence defined neuronal populations involved in respiratory control in order to determine the mode(s) of circuit re-connectivity that causally drive recovery in response to PTEN and PTP? manipulation. We will target PTEN and PTP? with systemic delivery of inhibitory peptides and rVRG neuron-specific transduction with AAV-shRNA. We will compliment this approach using an array of cutting-edge functional and axonal/synaptic tracing methods to assess rVRG-PMN circuit plasticity.  We hypothesize that stimulating (1) regeneration of injured rVRG axons, (2) sprouting of spared fibers originating in contralateral rVRG, and (3) synaptic connectivity of these growing rVRG axons with PMNs (located caudal to the lesion) will causally promote recovery of diaphragmatic respiratory function following cervical SCI. We also hypothesize that the combination of rVRG axon regeneration and sprouting of spared rVRG fibers will promote robust diaphragm recovery in the clinically-associated cervical contusion SCI model.  We will acquire an in-depth understanding of how modulating axon growth inhibition can induce rVRG- PMN circuit plasticity and, importantly, which modes of connectivity promote diaphragm recovery after SCI."
"9598091","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent approval of anti-cancer immunotherapeutic drugs by the FDA validates that stimulation of the immune system of a cancer patient is an effective way to control or prevent metastatic disease. However, the approved immune checkpoint blockade inhibitors are effective only in a subset of melanoma patients, and a majority of the cancer patients do not respond to the drugs. Moreover, cancers such as breast cancers do not respond well to these drugs, suggesting additional immune stimulatory approaches such as therapeutic vaccination need to be developed. One of the major problems in developing vaccination-based immunotherapies for cancer is the heterogeneous nature of the disease. Recent deep gene sequencing studies demonstrated extensive intratumoral and interpersonal heterogeneity in gene mutations in tumors. Therefore, developing a therapeutic vaccine using a single antigen/peptide or patient-derived autologous/allogeneic tumor cell lines, which may not represent the heterogeneity of tumors, would not result in an immune response against the breadth of tumor antigens. Therefore, to induce immunity against the specific antigenic signature of a patient, use of an optimally adjuvanted vaccine based on whole autologous tumor tissue is highly desirable. We have developed an adjuvanted whole tumor tissue based vaccine for cancer immunotherapy using tumor membrane vesicles (TMVs) prepared from whole tumor tissue and modifying them by incorporating immunostimulatory molecules (ISMs) such as B7-1 and IL-12 using a novel protein transfer method. This method immobilizes ISMs onto TMVs via a glycolipid anchor (GPI), resulting in simultaneous delivery of TMVs along with biological adjuvants to APCs for enhanced uptake and optimal immune cell activation. Based on promising preclinical data in mice, Emory University and Metaclipse Therapeutics Corporation have entered into an agreement to advance this immunotherapy approach to clinics targeting triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). This subtype of cancer is highly heterogeneous and target antigens vary from patient to patient, thus making it an ideal target for our personalized immunotherapy. Metaclipse was awarded an NIH Phase I SBIR grant to further validate the technology in a TNBC model and is currently conducting studies required for IND filing. In this partnership grant application we propose to: 1) Perform preclinica studies to make recommendations on the use of the TMV-based, patient-specific immunotherapy in combination with standard-of-care treatments, 2) Investigate the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the yield and biological activity of the TMV-based immunotherapy prepared from mouse tumor tissue and human tumor tissue derived from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models as well as TNBC patients and 3) Evaluate the TMV-based immunotherapy approach using human TNBC tumor tissue and human GPI-ISMs in a PDX model engrafted with a human immune system. The knowledge obtained from the proposed collaborative studies between Emory University and Metaclipse will aid in designing a clinical trial strategy for TMV-based immunotherapy in TNBC patients."

"9469467","Project Summary Alzheimer?s disease and related dementia (referred to collectively here as ?dementia?) is estimated to be one of the most costly health conditions in America, with most of the costs coming from long-term services and supports (LTSS) ? help with everyday activities, such as bathing, dressing, grooming, using the toilet, eating, and moving around ? much of which is provided by family. Almost 4 million adults 70 and over receive care from family and friends for cognitive impairment or dementia, and the need for this care will only increase as the nation grows grayer. Quantifying the need for and availability of family care for dementia, as well as quantifying the burden of care on individual caregivers, will help decision-makers adequately prepare for future shortages in the number of dementia caregivers and ensure the well-being of such caregivers. This work will use a variety of data sources and methods to examine the interplay between two trends that appear to be on a collision course: declining family size (lower supply) and increasing numbers of dementia cases (higher demand). Our key innovation is to link an existing demographic microsimulation model (MSM) with data on dementia incidence, thereby providing the first study to examine the future availability of family care for older adults with dementia. While there is some work modeling the demand side of care needs for dementia or other chronic disease incidence, the few studies of the supply side of family care are limited: they do not examine caregiving for dementia in particular, and most also incorporate only a limited definition of family care. We propose to build on a long-standing microsimulation model of expected kinship networks to develop a model of the supply of family care and to use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS), a subsample of HRS respondents ages 70 and over, in combination with published data on dementia incidence to develop a demand model of dementia incidence. We will link the two models using data from the HRS on the predictors of dementia care. Data from the HRS will also be used to identify groups at high risk of needing or providing care and on anticipated hours of care from different family members (e.g. spouses, biological kin, step-kin, etc.). Finally, the output of the linked models will be tested under different assumptions about how care patterns and demographic trends will change over time. This combination of information is critical for informing families and policymakers about anticipated shortages in dementia family care, as well as increases in the burden of care on individual family members in the U.S., which is expected to reach new heights as the baby boomers age."
"9461003","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The purpose of this research is to increase understanding of how families in rural Appalachia manage care for older relatives with Alzheimer?s disease or other dementias. These families may be especially challenged because of regional characteristics such as low population density in isolated communities; low income, education, and employment; poor housing; lack of health insurance and reliable transportation; and limited health care facilities, specialized health care providers, and community support services. Understanding their unique situation will make it easier to plan supports and services to help caregiving families. Specifically, the aim of this project is to learn from families in Appalachia about their approaches to caregiving across stages of Alzheimer?s disease and uncover whether they need and use community services currently as well as their views of formal service use in the future. The research is based on a guiding model of caregiving stress and influences on service use. This model incorporates multiple pieces of information about both individual and community factors that affect care needs and service use. The research employs multiple strategies to gather information. Community members will help the researchers with refining the participant the data collection tools and also with interpreting study findings in light of cultural values in rural Appalachia. Participants are 120 family caregivers who respond to a telephone survey followed by brief calls about daily events for 7 days. A subset of 25 caregivers will be invited to have a longer conversation about their caregiving situation and needs so the research team can gain deeper insights about the meaning of the survey results. This combination of asking specific questions in a large group followed by deeper probing using open-ended questions with a smaller subset of them is very effective for learning as much as possible about participants? experiences. Statistical methods are used to identify groups and trends in the survey and daily events data, and the longer interviews are summarized by grouping similar answers and identifying all the different perspectives in the interviews. The findings from this project will reveal diverse approaches to family caregiving for persons with Alzheimer?s disease. This information is important because their approaches and needs may differ from those used by families in urban areas. It is also important because with this knowledge, professionals can develop programs and services that families in Appalachia need, want, and find helpful. Having those programs and services will help families provide the best possible care for their relatives."
"9501101","Abstract Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of death in the US, affecting over 300,000 citizens annually. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recently released ?Strategies to Improve Survival from Cardiac Arrest: A Time to Act,? stating ?although breakthroughs in understanding and treatment are impressive, the ability to consistently deliver timely interventions and high-quality care is less than impressive.? The IOM?s work highlighted that the cooperation between stakeholders essential to deliver optimal care for patients with OHCA is lacking. Indeed, marked geographic variability exists in the management and outcomes of OHCA, and leading professional societies support the development of cardiac arrest systems of care. OHCA survival in a given community is a function of its individuals (e.g. age, comorbid conditions), hospital characteristics (e.g. protocols for targeted temperature management and early cardiac catheterization), and organization of the system of care (e.g. percent of patients taken to high volume centers). In the current structure, accountability for outcomes resides at the provider or facility level, but no regional benchmarks or incentives exist to improve OHCA outcomes at the community level. The IOM defines total population health as ?the health of all persons living in a specified geopolitical area? and encourages health systems, hospitals, and payers to create systems of care that meet the needs of patients and improve the health of the total population. The proposed study develops a new attribution method for Medicare beneficiaries sustaining OHCA by applying spatial methods to identify naturally occurring geographic clusters defined not by health system affiliation, but by how patients access healthcare for emergencies. Defining regional boundaries allows for benchmarking of outcomes, and facilitates development of population-based incentives. This approach can be directly translated into practice by using population-based payment strategies as described by the U.S. Secretary of Health & Human Services and implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Aim 1 will describe the existing patterns of hospital utilization for patients with OHCA. Aim 2 will identify existing spatial clusters of hospitals that treat members of a community with OHCA. Aim 3 will determine variability in risk-adjusted outcomes at the population level. This work provides the scaffolding to enable the construction of new payment models that are consistent with the IOM vision of total population health, the American Heart Association?s efforts to build regional systems of care, and the CMS efforts to improve population health. Our research team, richly experienced in health services research methods and application to cardiac arrest investigations, is uniquely positioned to conduct these studies, which will build on our current work under an R56 mechanism."
"9494338","SUMMARY Chemoprevention of Breast Cancer by Targeting Glucose Metabolism with HJC0152  About 60-70% of breast cancers (BCs) are estrogen receptor (ER)-positive BCs (EPBCs), and the remaining 30-40% are ER-negative BCs (ENBCs). Currently available anti-ER-based chemopreventive therapies, such as selective ER modulators and aromatase inhibitors, are effective in preventing only about half of EPBCs and do not prevent any ENBCs, meaning that almost 60% of BCs cannot be prevented with existing anti-ER-based preventive agents. In particular, the majority of ENBCs are triple-negative BCs (TNBCs), which grow faster, spread earlier, and recur more often than other BC subtypes do, and the incidence of TNBC is higher among young African American and Hispanic/Latina women and women with BRCA1 mutations. BC survivors, particularly ENBC and TNBC survivors are at a predictable increased risk of developing a new BC in the breasts. Thus, the prevention of BC in those ?healthy? women and BC survivors represents a huge, urgent but unmet need, since currently available preventive agents are anti-ER-based, and is ineffective to protect women from developing BC. Those women or BC survivors will likely benefit most from effective, non?ER-based preventive drugs. The proposed research will directly address this overarching challenge by defining new intervention points and developing effective agents for preventing all BC subtypes. We recently discovered a small molecule, HJC0152, which can modulate glucose metabolism and effectively block premalignant lesions and ENBC/TNBC formation in transgenic mouse models of human ENBC. We hypothesize that effective modulation, reprograming, and restoration of dysregulated glucose metabolism with HJC0152 will reverse precancerous changes and block BC development. We will test this hypothesis through 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the preventive efficacy of HJC0152 in ENBC and TNBC models in various clinically relevant prevention settings. Preclinical assessments and safety profiling will also be performed. In Aim 2, we will identify the physically interacting targets of HJC0152 that are essential to ENBC/TNBC development through multiple approaches including bait-molecule affinity binding to capture potential targets of HJC0152. In preliminary studies, we have identified a list of bona fide targets for HJC0152 for further investigation. In Aim 3, we will characterize and validate the top-ranked high-confidence target of HJC0152, arginase, by performing affinity binding determination, co-complex of ligand-target interaction, gain- /loss-of-function assessments, and expression determination experiments in breast cells and tumors. These studies will elucidate the drivers of BC development and provide a solid foundation for further preclinical and clinical development of HJC0152 as a non-ER-based preventive drug candidate. Given the demonstrated preventive efficacy of HJC0152, low toxicity profiles, identification of high-confidence HJC0152 targets and ongoing validation, and the convenience of oral administration of HJC0152, outcomes from this project will have high translational potential to foster new strategies of chemoprevention for BC, particularly ENBC/TNBC."
"9462571","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract An estimated 27 million Americans age 25 and older have osteoarthritis (OA), a degenerative disease of articular cartilage characterized by loss of the cartilage matrix, mainly collagen and proteoglycans, leading to joint tissue destruction and loss of function. Before age 45, more men than women have osteoarthritis; after age 45, it is more common in women. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 has recently gained interest due to its elevated levels in synovial fluid and sera from OA patients and its capacity to upregulate the expression of MMP-13 and inhibit the expression of type-II collagen. Mature miRNAs are non-coding RNAs that inhibit the translation and stability of target mRNAs and are now known to undergo addition of non-template nucleotides (largely uridines) to the 3' ends (3'NTAs). The enzymes responsible for 3' end modifications of miRNAs have only recently been identified in cancer and immune cells but have not yet been described in cartilage or chondrocytes. Our preliminary data show that (1) ZCCHC6-a nucleotidyl transferase-is highly expressed in damaged OA cartilage; and (2) regulates IL-6 expression in human chondrocytes. ZCCHC6 is known to uridylate mRNAs thus suggesting that ZCCHC6-mediated miRNA 3'end modifications could play a significant role in the post-transcriptional regulation of IL-6, and possibly of other inflammatory mediators, in OA. We will pursue 4 specific aims to test the fundamental hypothesis that ZCCHC6 uridylates mature miRNAs in chondrocytes to regulate IL-6 expression and inflammation in OA. Specific Aim-1. Studies will test the hypothesis that cytokine targeting miRNAs are uridylated in OA cartilage. Specific Aim-2. We will test the hypothesis that miRNA uridylation abrogates repression of IL-6 expression in human OA chondrocytes. Specific Aim-3. We will test the hypothesis that expression of ZCCHC6 is essential for IL-6 expression in human OA chondrocytes. Specific Aim-4. In an animal model of human OA we will test the hypothesis that ZCCHC6 mediates miRNA uridylation and regulate IL-6 expression during the induction and progression of the disease. Knowledge gained from these studies will be important since by understanding how miRNA 3'end modifications affect the expression of inflammatory mediators in OA may lead to the development of novel biomarkers and therapies for the effective treatment of OA."
"9681760","Project summary  Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are implicated in several pathophysiological conditions including Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s diseases, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and in the development of nicotine addiction. Therefore, pharmacological targeting of neuronal nAChR holds promise in the development of drug strategies to treat these conditions. The presence of multiple neuronal nAChR subtypes (e.g. ?4?2 and ?7 nAChR) with different subunit composition and unique physiological and pathological profiles hinders the development of nAChR selective therapeutics and only few neuronal nAChR drugs are clinically available. Since neuronal nAChRs share conserved ACh binding sites, it has proven difficult to develop agonists with high nAChR subtype selectivity. Moreover, direct activation of neuronal nAChRs by agonists is associated with alteration in cholinergic transmission due to prolonged activation and desensitization of nAChRs. As a result, positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of nAChRs have emerged as a novel and more physiologically relevant strategy to enhance brain cholinergic transmission. PAMs do not bind to the ACh binding site or activate nAChRs in the absence of ACh. Rather, they potentiate ACh-induced responses by binding at site(s) distinct from the ACh binding sites. However, information regarding the location of nAChR PAM binding site(s) and the mechanisms responsible for PAM action are lacking. Our long-term goal is to determine the number and location of nAChR PAM binding sites and to develop nAChR subtype-selective PAMs for experimental and clinical uses. Our objective for this study is to identify binding sites for two structurally-unrelated ?4?2 nAChR PAMs (dFBr and CMPI). Our central hypothesis is that ?4?2 nAChRs have multiple PAM binding sites and that nAChR PAMs interact differently with these sites. We will us two complementary approaches: 1- Photoaffinity labeling with photoreactive nAChR PAMs to directly identify amino acids contributing to PAM binding sites; and 2- Mutational analyses coupled with in vitro electrophysiological recording to define the contribution of subunit interfaces in allosteric modulation of ?4?2 nAChR. The completion of this work will provide structural information that are important for understanding the diversity of allosteric binding sites in nAChRs and would facilitate the development of more selective ?4?2 nAChR PAMs."
"9315368","PROJECT SUMMARY In 2016, the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) recognized Addiction Medicine as a new subspecialty. In anticipation of this, and to assure that the development of this field would include physicians committed to addiction research, the Research in Addiction Medicine Scholars (RAMS) Program was created in 2012 with this original NIDA R-25 award. The paucity of well-trained addiction physician researchers limits scientific advancement, risking missed opportunities to explore optimal approaches to care for patients with substance use disorders. Furthermore, physicians trained in Addiction Medicine must be poised to provide leadership related to their expertise in their academic medical centers and communities. The RAMS Program seeks to continue and improve on its mission to strengthen the next generation of addiction physician researchers and leaders in healthcare. Currently US fellowship programs exist in both Addiction Medicine (n=41) and Addiction Psychiatry (n=45). These fellows are the source of RAM Scholars as the program takes place during fellowship training. In this renewal application, we continue and enhance the mission of the RAMS Program to bolster addiction research training for fellows at local fellowship sites with a combination of intensive annual in-person trainings in Boston and at the College of Problems of Drug Dependence (CPDD) national conference as well as in monthly webinars. The RAMS Program supports a new cadre of addiction physician researchers by meaningfully encouraging physician careers in addiction research through training and mentorship. The Program Directors (PDs) and staff will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) Provide clinical research training over 2 years to 5 addiction subspecialty physicians (RAM Scholars) and over 1 year to 1-2 chief residents (Junior Scholars) interested in addiction research, selected annually, through retreats, webinars, and research-in-progress sessions. 2) Augment institutional mentoring of addiction subspecialty physicians on research projects and career trajectory by establishing mentorship relationships between Scholars and nationally recognized researchers (RAMS National Advisory Committee [NAC]) and the RAMS Program research methodologist. 3 Provide leadership training for addiction subspecialty physicians (RAM Scholars) by introducing physicians to the concepts and skills necessary for future academic leadership roles within organizations and community. The Research in Addiction Medicine Scholars (RAMS) Program will accelerate the progress of its important mission of developing the next generation of addiction physician researchers in order to advance the knowledge base to provide better care for patients with, and at risk for, addictive diseases, by supporting trainees as the clinical training of addiction physicians continues to expand nationally."
"9520122","PROJECT 1: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The concept of the exposome involves not only the combined effects of multiple chemicals, it entails the social and lifestyle factors that influence chemical toxicity, and the idea that the specific life stage of exposure can affect disease risks. Millions of people in the US are exposed to arsenic, which is ranked first on the Superfund chemical priority list. For several reasons, northern Chile is one of the best places in the world to study arsenic. First, this is the driest habitable place on earth, and despite its large population, it has very few individual water sources, with essentially each city being supplied by its own single municipal source. Second, these sources have had a wide range of arsenic concentrations, and arsenic records on all of these sources are available for over 50 years. Because of this, one simply needs to know what cities a person has lived in during which years to have a good idea of that person's lifetime arsenic exposure. This type of lifelong exposure data is not available in any other area in the world including the US. Third, the largest city in the area, Antofagasta, had a distinct period of high exposure beginning in 1958 when two rivers with high arsenic concentrations were diverted to the city for drinking, and ending in 1970 when an arsenic treatment plant was installed. Studying health effects now in people who were born during this distinct exposure period offers a rare opportunity to examine the impacts of early-life exposure on adult disease. Superfund has been supporting research in this area for 20+ years, and we have made a large number of novel discoveries. We found that early-life arsenic exposure was associated with >5-fold significant increases in adult lung cancer, >7-fold increases in bladder cancer, and respiratory effects similar to those seen with heavy smoking. We also identified marked increases in susceptibility due to arsenic metabolism, genetics, and common co-exposures like second-hand smoke and workplace exposures. Most recently, we found that arsenic-related cancer and lung disease were much greater in people who were overweight (e.g. synergy index=4.05, 95%CI=1.27?12.88). Here, we propose to use the unique exposure scenario in Chile to explore associations between arsenic and hypertension and endocrine diseases like prostate cancer and diabetes. Currently, data linking these outcomes to arsenic are mixed or controversial. However to date, no study has examined them using information on lifetime exposure, and no study has examined the potential modifying effects of early-life exposure, obesity, or stress. This is important since our recent research suggests that each of these factors may play a major role in arsenic-related disease. Overall, the significance of our project lies in the facts that arsenic exposure in the US is widespread, and that diabetes, hypertension, and prostate cancer are major causes of morbidity and mortality here. It is also lies in the facts that obesity and stress are common and important risk factors for disease, and that little is currently known about the long-term effects of early-life exposure. Our goal is to provide new information on these issues that could have important implications for US policies on arsenic and other chemical exposures."
"9457215","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Maternal programming is a term that describes the action of maternal factors during sensitive periods of development that produces persistent effects in the offspring. For example, nutrient availability in the maternal environment has a major impact on fetal growth and later later-life metabolic and mental health. Also, a stressful maternal environment can alter offspring responsiveness to stress, and the quality of maternal care influences the cognitive and emotional development of the offspring. We have identified a novel programming paradigm using a mouse model in which maternal voluntary activity/exercise (in large cages with running wheels) vs. sedentary life (in standard cages) during the postpartum period improves a number of cognitive, emotional and social behaviors of the offspring. Since voluntary wheel running suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines associated with the low grade inflammation of sedentary animals, we extended the model by further increasing maternal inflammation by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which worsened offspring behaviors. Therefore, dams in cages with running wheels approximate mothers with normal postpartum period, while dams in standard cages and LPS-injected dams in cages with wheels represent mothers with postpartum complications of low grade inflammation (associated with obesity and psychiatric disease) and frank inflammation (as a result of peripartum infection). Although the long-term beneficial effect of exercise in individual is well known, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first that implicates an intergenerational effect of maternal exercise during the postpartum period on behavior. Preliminary data suggest that this programming is mediated by milk cytokines and growth factors and therefore we refer to it as lactocrine behavioral programming. Our working model is that sedentary conditions and the associated low grade inflammation during lactation, imposed by standard laboratory housing, as well as maternal systemic inflammatory conditions, result in complex changes in the cytokine/growth factor composition of the milk, which lead to changes in offspring immune system development. This in turn alters the offspring epigenome at environmentally sensitive domains we recently identified in hippocampal and cortical neurons. Because of the association of epigenetic domains with synaptic genes, neurons undergo structural changes that alter their connectivity and function and ultimately behavior. This proposal will specify the milk cytokine/immunological link, connecting the postpartum mother with the developing offspring (Aim 1), the impact of the maternal effect on the offspring epigenome (Aim 2), and the neuron structural basis of the behavioral changes in the offspring (Aim 3)."
"9473001","SUMMARY Skeletal muscle injury-repair and regeneration is a multi-cellular process that involves repair of acute injury to the sarcolemma, mobilization of satellite cells to replace the lost-muscle fibers, and control of fibrotic remodeling for maintenance of muscle integrity. In muscular dystrophy, compromised sarcolemma integrity or membrane repair triggers the cascade of muscle degeneration that incurs progressive, severe morbidity and ultimately mortality. Developing therapeutic approaches to improve sarcolemma integrity while facilitating regeneration of injured muscle fibers remain a major challenge in muscle physiology research. This project builds on the discovery of MG53, a member of the TRIM-family protein, as an essential component of the cell membrane repair machinery. MG53 functions in vesicle trafficking and facilitates the nucleation of intracellular vesicles to sites of membrane disruption for repair patch formation. Native MG53 is present in blood circulation, at levels directly correlating with injury or secretory activity of the muscle. Administration of recombinant human MG53 (rhMG53) protein protects muscle fibers and stem cells from injury, and reduces muscle fibrosis in the mdx mouse model. Our research with MG53 over the past few years has established a potential tri-functional role for MG53 in muscle injury-regeneration, as a facilitator to repair acute sarcolemma injury, a contributor to activate satellite cells during the early phase of muscle injury, and a modulator of fibrosis by controlling fibroblast differentiation associated with chronic muscle injury. We envision that targeting the tri-functional role of MG53 will have advantage over the current paradigms for treating muscular dystrophy. In Aim 1, we will determine the pathways that transduce the newly identified myokine function of MG53 into activation of satellite cells in response to acute muscle injury; define the mechanisms that underlie MG53?s function in regulating fibrosis during chronic muscle injury; and test if non-invasive interventions can modulate circulating MG53 levels toward muscle injury-regeneration. If circulating MG53 plays a role in satellite cell activation, we predict that ischemia-preconditioning that releases MG53 without muscle injury, or inducible secretion of MG53 from a transgenic mouse model, will effectively activate satellite cells and muscle regeneration following injury. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the safety and efficacy for sustained elevation of MG53 in circulation to preserve muscle integrity/satellite cell activation/fibrosis control in animal models of muscular dystrophy. Fulfillment of the studies in this project will advance the biology of MG53 in muscle injury-repair and regeneration, and lay the foundation for our translational approach for targeting MG53 function for treatment of muscular dystrophy."

"9460991","ABSTRACT It is commonly accepted that implant wear particles, generated from the implant device, induce peri-prosthetic osteolysis, a form of chronic inflammatory bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts. Growing evidence suggests that older populations are more susceptible to bone osteolysis. There is a critical need for new strategies to prevent or treat peri-prosthetic osteolysis in the aging society of the U.S. However, the underlying mechanisms for aging-associated osteoclast precursor migration, especially to the peripheral bone lesions, remain elusive. Our earlier studies demonstrate that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is chemotactic for blood circulating osteoclast precursors via its cognate receptor CXCR4 in vitro as well as in vivo in a mouse model of particle-induced calvaria osteolysis (Movila et al., 2016. JBMR).Also, the high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), recently identified as a central mediator of cellular senescence, significantly enhances MIF secretion from aging rather than young macrophages in vitro. Based on these lines of evidence, we hypothesize that the HMGB1/MIF axis plays a key role in the homing of circulating CXCR4+ OCPs to wear particle-induced osteolytic lesions in the aging population. In this application, Specific Aim 1 is designed to establish the role of HMGB1 in increased MIF production by peri-prosthetic macrophages of aging mice with particle-induced calvaria osteolysis. We will compare the role of HMGB1 and its receptors (TLR family of innate immune receptors and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts [RAGE]) relative to the release of MIF from peri-prosthetic macrophages of young (two month-old) and aged (twenty four month-old) wild type animals, both in vitro and in vivo. In Specific Aim 2, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which MIF promotes chemotactic migration of circulating OCPs to particle-induced osteolysis lesions in senescent animals. We will establish the molecular mechanism underlying MIF-mediated age-dependent recruitment of OCPs to osteolysis lesions in young vs. aged mice by comparison of the known MIF receptors including, CD74, CXCR2 and CXCR4. For this purpose, real time locomotion of eGFP+CD11b+ OCPs in Csf1r-eGFP-knock-in mice will be monitored using FDA-approved state-of-the-art Cellvizio (Mauna Kea Technologies) intravital endoscopic imaging technology. The proposed research project represents one of the first investigations into the contribution of circulating OCPs to particle-induced bone lytic lesions in senescent organisms. Further, this study will provide a paradigm-shifting framework for the development of novel therapies against wear debris-induced osteolysis lesions in older people, targeting MIF activity."
"9551762","SUMMARY The latent, replication-competent HIV reservoir in resting CD4+ T cells is a major obstacle to curing HIV infection. All therapeutic strategies which have been developed to eliminate this latent viral reservoir rely on a targeted approach that must first reverse HIV latency. This reversal facilitates viral antigen expression, such that the infected cell can become vulnerable to immune clearance mechanisms (which may also require therapeutic or immunomodulatory enhancement strategies for greater efficacy). While recent trials demonstrated that administration of a latency reversing agents (LRAs) to HIV-infected individuals could effectively reverse viral latency in vivo, there are multiple challenges that need to be addressed before LRAs can be routinely implemented in the clinical setting. Specifically, clinically viable LRAs tested ex vivo only reverse latency in a subset of infected cells, and their maximum potency is typically much less than when cells are exposed to maximum mitogen activation. Collectively, this finding suggests that there might be limitations to the effectiveness of using a single LRA, and recent studies support the use of combinatorial LRA strategies to effectively and comprehensively purge the pool of replication-competent, integrated, latent HIV. Unfortunately, only a handful of mechanistically distinct LRAs have been identified, and consequently there is an immediate need to identify new targets for the development of potent activators of HIV-1 latency. To this end, Gilead Sciences, Inc. identified the cyanotriazole GS-46 as a new class of LRA. GS-46 strongly synergizes with proteasome inhibitors to induce HIV latency reversal at levels similar to those seen with mitogenic stimulus, but without T cell activation. The scientific premise of this R21 application is that elucidation of the mechanism(s) by which GS-46 alone, and in combination with proteasome inhibitors, reverses HIV latency will identify new targets for rational targeted development of LRAs, and will provide novel and important insights into the mechanisms responsible for the maintenance and reversal of HIV latency in resting CD4+ T cells."
"9468323","Dementia is a common and greatly feared condition associated with aging. In the United States, the prevalence of dementia is expected to nearly triple to 13 million persons by 2050. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a risk factor for dementia, is also rapidly increasing. Emerging data suggests the first line treatment for T2DM, metformin, may decrease dementia risk. In animal models, metformin improves memory and appears to protect against dementia. If this finding is established in humans, it could inform clinical decisions including how early in the course of diabetes to initiate metformin and whether to continue metformin when patients transition to insulin. However, definitive data are lacking. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not been conducted to study whether metformin prevents dementia in humans. It would be premature to conduct an RCT given the current state of the literature and the high cost and long follow-up time required. Inconsistent results from extant observational studies may be due to inadequate control for confounding.  The current proposal uses rich electronic health data resources from the Veterans Health Administration (VA) and Group Health (GH), an integrated healthcare system in the Northwest United States, to conduct a rigorous retrospective cohort study of the association between metformin use and incident dementia. We will use electronic health records (EHR) to identify a cohort of about 100,000 VA patients and 20,000 GH patients who have T2DM and are free of dementia and not taking diabetes medications at baseline. We will use a new user design and state of the art analytic methods including propensity scores and inverse probability of treatment weighting to control for potential confounding factors including diabetes severity. The long observation periods (17 years in VA and 20 years in GH) will ensure adequate power. The rich EHR data including diagnoses, procedures, laboratory and vital signs measures will enable us to control for many potential confounding factors such as hemoglobin A1c levels, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and the use of concomitant medications. The primary analysis will use VA data, and findings will be replicated using GH data; independent replication in two unique large healthcare systems will improve the validity of our findings. We will address the following specific aims: 1. Compare risk of dementia in people initiating metformin for T2DM versus those initiating a sulfonylurea. 2. Compare risk of dementia in people initiating metformin vs. those delaying initial pharmacologic therapy, 3. Determine if the metformin ? dementia association varies by age groups (50-65 vs. >65 years of age) and by gender. Exploratory analysis will investigate metformin dose and duration and risk of dementia. By using the same measures and methods to replicate results in very different patient populations, we will generate the strongest evidence to date regarding metformin?s potential to reduce risk of dementia. Results will inform provider-patient discussions about metformin use and could guide design of a subsequent, efficient RCT that targets people most likely to benefit from metformin."
"9451325","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to understand the effects of anxiety on reward responsiveness in adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN), and how this interaction predicts clinical outcome subsequent to intensive treatment. AN is notorious for its resistance to interventions and for the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric disorders. Variou forms of intensive treatment may succeed in restoring weight, yet overall benefits of treatment remain limited and early relapse is unusually high. While evidence suggests that genetic factors play a role in susceptibility, remarkably little is known about AN's mechanistic neural circuitry. Individuals with AN typically exhibit prodromal anxiety early in life prior to disordered eating. This phenotypic expression may manifest as exaggerated threat perception, and hypersensitivity to and avoidance of signals of weight and shape change. In parallel, individuals with restricting-type AN, beginning in early childhood, are reticent to exposure to novel and high reward environments. This is in line with most psychometric and neuroimaging studies that suggest low responsiveness to natural rewards, as well as aberrant reward system activity and dopaminergic function. However, the interaction between anxiety and reward circuits has never been interrogated in AN. There is substantial evidence of distinct yet overlapping neural systems mediating approach (related to reward) and avoidance (related to anxiety), which are integrated in balancing and switching between behaviors related to the predominant valence state. Thus, we posit that high degrees of reactivity of cortico-limbic circuits underlying anxiety may contribute to diminished capacity to respond to reward stimuli. This may translate clinically to lower motivation to engage in treatment; in effect, a lower drive to change behaviors and thought patterns necessary for improvement based on expectancy of benefits of future outcome, resulting in a course trajectory of weight loss and worsening of symptoms. Accordingly, this study investigates this anxiety and reward interaction in individuals with AN who have recently completed intensive treatment, and whom will be followed for degree of symptom relapse over 6 months. Forty two adolescents with restricting-type AN and 42 matched controls will engage in reward tasks in which individually- tailored anxiety provoking word stimuli are interleaved, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Reward and anxiety neural circuit activity, and their interaction, will be analyzed in relationship to their ability to predict trajetory of BMI and symptom severity changes over the subsequent 6 months. Using novel designs for interrogating the functionality of positive and negative valence circuits may thus lead to identification of dimensional phenotypes associated with disease persistence, a critical step towards developing individualized and targeted treatment strategies (such as reduction of stimuli-specific anxiety and/or enhancement of positive affect) for high-risk subgroups."
"9460912","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mutations in the type I ryanodine receptor (RyR1) are associated with a variety of human muscle diseases including malignant hyperthermia (MH), MH with cores, central core disease (CCD), multi-minicore disease, and others. RyR1-related myopathies are among the most common group of non-dystrophic muscle diseases and are associated with significant clinical disabilities, often including wheelchair dependence, severe scoliosis, respiratory failure, and can result in premature death in childhood. Currently there are no therapies for these devastating myopathies. MH mutations in RyR1 are frequently associated with heat stress, and/or exercise-induced heat stroke and/or rhabdomyolysis. CCD is a congenital myopathy associated with metabolically inactive central cores in skeletal muscle fibers, but the presence of cores is highly variable (despite the name) and the severity of the disease does not correlate with cores. We have shown that some CCD mutations increase Ca2+ leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, while others decrease Ca2+ permeation through RyR1. These finding raise the question of how opposing functional effects on RyR1 can result in related diseases. To answer this central, unresolved question and aid in the development of new interventions, we created mouse models of MH with cores (Y524S, YS) and CCD (I4895T, IT). Heterozygous YS mice are susceptible to anesthetic and heat-induced sudden death and also exhibit an age-dependent myopathy characterized by mitochondrial damage and the formation of amorphous cores. Heterozygous IT mice are not heat sensitive, but display decreased exercise capacity, deceased muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and a myopathy that increases with age. In this renewal application, we propose to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which functionally opposing RyR1 mutations produce these distinct phenotypes and then use these findings to develop new, mechanism-based therapeutic interventions for MH and CCD.  Our working hypothesis is that the YS mutation drives the disease via increased RyR1 Ca2+ leak, activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), and oxidative stress, while the IT mutation enhances SR Ca2+ content, which leads to increased ER stress, p53 expression, mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we propose to: 1) Define the role of altered cytosolic, mitochondrial, and SR lumenal Ca2+ signaling and mPTP activation in the YS and IT myopathies. 2) Define the roles of RyR1 post- translational modifications. 3) Define the role of p53 in the IT myopathy and the enhanced heat sensitivity of YS mice. 4) Assess the potential of S107, NAC, 4PBA, and pifithrin-µ as interventions for MH and CCD. There are currently no therapies to treat RyR1-related myopathies. This multi-PI application is designed to address this need by carefully delineating specific cellular pathways that underlie disease processes and then to use this information to develop and test several novel therapeutic interventions with distinct mechanisms of action."

"9469465","In the United States, nearly 100,000 patients receive general anesthesia and sedation daily to safely undergo surgical and non-surgical procedures. A high proportion of the patients receiving anesthesia care are elderly, and in addition may have pre-existing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease or cerebrovascular disease. As such, elderly patients have a higher risk of post-operative delirium and cognitive dysfunction. Anesthesiologists know that management of older patients requires different approaches compared with that of younger patients. For example, the dose required to achieve the same anesthetic state in elderly patients can be 50% lower than that for younger patients. Unfortunately, at present we know little about the fundamental neurophysiology of how anesthetic drugs influence the aging brain. This represents a major knowledge gap that prevents us from developing novel approaches to more safely administer anesthesia and sedation in elderly patients. In recent years, aided largely by non-invasive imaging methods, significant progress has been made in understanding systems-level neurophysiology of anesthetic effects in humans. In parallel, imaging biomarkers have advanced to enable the identification of two of the most common ?silent? pathologies that may put older adults at higher risk for poor post-anesthesia/surgical outcomes: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD). We propose here to bring these two lines of research together with a study employing imaging markers of preclinical AD (amyloid PET, cortical atrophy) and CVD (FLAIR MRI, DTI) alongside sophisticated computational analysis of intra-operative EEG, with the goal of using these measures to better understand variability in response to anesthesia and post-operative outcomes. As we accomplish the aims of this grant, the data generated should lead to fundamental new insights into the neurophysiology of anesthesia in aging patients. These insights will advance knowledge about how to assess patients for risks of anesthesia and reduce those risks through improved brain monitoring, improved drug dosing, and a precision- medicine approach to tailoring anesthesia to the individual's brain."
"9530214","Abstract:  The devastating progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the early prodromal to late stages has stimulated a search for drugs that prevent this progression and a quest for drugs that can treat the symptoms of memory loss to improve the quality of life even in the face of decline. We hypothesize that determining the effect of AD progression on the dynamic activity of important local circuits in the rodent hippocampus, the tri-synaptic circuit known to underlie spatial memory, will produce an early indicator of brain dysfunction that is more relevant for the discovery of drugs that will work in humans, especially given the conservation of this circuit in all mammals. The firing patterns of CA3 & CA1 pyramidal cells (or ?place cells?) within the hippocampus respond to and encode spatial representations. Our previous in vivo electrophysiological study of aged impaired rats, a model for amnestic cognitive impairment (aMCI), demonstrated that we are able to quantify age and novelty specific effects of drugs on CA3 & CA1 place cell dynamics and on spatial memory (Robitsek 2015). In this application, we propose to use an exciting new rat model for AD (TgF344-AD) that displays amyloid plaques and, importantly, neurofibrillary tangles to determine how the progression of pathology seen in human patients is associated with alterations in hippocampal place cell dynamics over time. In addition, we will probe the acute effects of a GABA- A receptor negative allosteric modulator selective for tonically active alpha5 subunit containing receptors that is a memory enhancer on place cell dynamics. We will use high density in vivo electrophysiology for monitoring ?place cell? function with age in this novel rat transgenic model to ask the following questions: When does the tri- synaptic circuit become disturbed? Is early disturbance associated with P-tau and neurofibrillary tangle formation, or is it independent? Is there a distinct part of the hippocampal tri-synaptic circuitry that is most vulnerable during disease progression? And finally, can we begin to explain the mechanism by which a negative allosteric modulator of active inhibitory receptors results in spatial memory enhancement. We anticipate that completion of these studies will identify the activity profile of CA3 & CA1 place cells in AD rats that eventually leads to a loss in memory and spread of neuropathology. These studies will be a first step toward elucidating the onset of neural circuitry dysfunction underlying spatial memory decline over a human APP695 and PS1 background that exhibits progressive neurofibrillary tangles and cognitive impairment and will provide a foundation for improved assessment for acute administration of memory enhancers in AD management."
"9494691","?4R00MH106649-03 PI: Avishek Adhikari Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section This proposal will be moved from the mentored phase institution (Stanford University) to the R00 institution (University of California, Los Angeles). No changes have been made to the experimental plans. The current proposal is specific to the R00 phase. Avoidance of potential threats is highly adaptive, and decreases exposure to risks. However, excessive anxiety and fear leads to anxiety disorders, which impact many aspects of life, from the interpersonal to professional spheres. Although each anxiety disorder has different symptoms, they all share a core feature: mal-adaptive expression of high levels anxiety. Here, we will study how the brain suppresses anxiety. Prior studies showed the amygdala is largely responsible for generating high anxiety and fear, while the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) decreases these behaviors, possibly by inhibiting amygdala output. Indeed, in humans higher vmPFC activation correlates with lower amygdala activation and decreased anxiety. These data suggest the vmPFC-amygdala pathway may decrease anxiety and fear, but they rely on correlative measures, and can't directly test this hypothesis. I used optogenetics to directly test if the vmPFC-amygdala projection suppresses anxiety and fear. Activation of the vmPFCamygdala pathway robustly inhibits innate anxiety and learned fear, while inhibition of this pathway increases anxiety. Intriguingly, these behavioral effects were mediated by a poorly studied region of the amygdala called the basomedial amygdala (BMA), as direct activation of the BMA also decreases anxiety. Now, I will map neural activity in the vmPFC-BMA circuit and dissect how activation of this circuit decreases anxiety. We first showed how vmPFC activity affects the BMA in vitro (Aim 1), uncovering the microcircuit-level dynamics underlying our behavioral findings. Next, to map the activity of the vmPFC-BMA projection, I will monitor calcium transients in the vmPFC terminals in the BMA during exploration of control and anxiogenic environments (Aim 2), revealing how activity of this projection differs in animals with high and low anxiety. In Aim 3, I will characterize activity of the BMA and of its output projections during anxiety and fear. The insights resulting from this project will guide future studies on anxiety."
"9454076","Project Summary The Functional Genomics and Microbiome Core (Core C) supports the mission of the DDC and enhances research programs in its theme of infection and injury affecting the mammalian intestine and liver. We continue to enhance the scope of the Core, based on DDC user demand and our firm commitment to the importance of the microbiome in gastrointestinal and liver biology. The emphasis of this Core is on functional genomics and how genes present in the mammalian microbiome and in mouse/human genomes may yield functional RNAs, proteins and metabolites that help stitch together a deeper and mechanistic understanding of digestive diseases. Our mission is to provide a full-service resource from experimental design to consultations about specimen processing, robust data analysis pipelines, bioinformatics strategies, and biostatistical support. In summary, we have created a fully integrated genomic and multi-`omic analysis platform for investigators studying digestive diseases. This Core serves DDC investigators by providing expertise in microbial and mammalian genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and protein analytics, as applied to gastrointestinal infection and injury states. Research programs nurtured by DDC members are facilitated by this Core's ability to bridge microbiome science and mammalian biology, and to provide multi-tiered services at the levels of genes and effectors (proteins and metabolites). This Core deploys the tools/services of microarrays, deep nucleic acid sequencing (microbial and mammalian), protein multiplexing, mass spectrometry-guided metabolomics, and bioinformatics. PCR-based analyses of gene expression and splicing, DNA mutation/SNP detection, and gene pathway analyses of the mammalian metagenome (microbe and man) will be fostered by this Core as a platform for gastrointestinal and hepatic systems biology. This Core presents a combination of shared as well as exclusive offerings to TMC DDC members. The Microbiome and Mammalian Genomics services provide valuable capital-intensive resources shared among DDC and non-DDC members at BCM. DDC members account for about 10% of institutional usage of metagenomics and mammalian genomics services.

"9447097","Project Summary As the world's population ages, the numbers of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) will significantly increase. Knowledge about the pathogenesis of preclinical AD and biomarkers has grown enormously in the last few years. However, little is known about how to utilize biomarker screening tests in clinical settings to obtain individualized risk predictions, to obtain demographic projections of numbers of persons in preclinical states, and to evaluate the public health impact of potential interventions that delay transitions between preclinical states. Our proposed work will fill a critical void by utilizing multistate modeling to address emerging questions in clinical practice and public health that are raised by the expanding knowledge of AD biomarkers. Aim 1 is to perform a systematic review in order to develop a framework for a multi-state model for progression through the pre-clinical period of Alzheimer's disease that incorporates biomarkers and competing risks of death, and to calibrate the model's transition rates. Aim 2 is to calculate absolute risks of developing clinical AD during one's lifetime based on biomarker screenings that account for competing risks of death and ages at screens. Aim 3 is to develop U.S. population projections of numbers of persons in preclinical and clinical states, and to evaluate the potential impact of future interventions that may decrease preclinical transition rates. Interventions may act at various stages of the natural history of preclinical disease, and our models will be used to evaluate their potential effects on population projections. Our approach extends our previous calculation methods used to project clinical AD to now incorporate biomarker preclinical disease states. Our methods include systematic review, mathematical modeling, and Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed research is significant and innovative because it will synthesize new biomarker evidence about the preclinical period of Alzheimer's disease into a unifying multi-state model that will have application for clinical practice and public health. The research will provide a platform for incorporating new information about biomarkers to enable ongoing updating and refinement of individualized estimates of risks of clinical AD, population projections, and the impact of potential interventions on those projections.  "
"9535573","7. Project Summary/Abstract Peru is rapidly increasing in stature in public health research, and many successful Peruvian-US research teams have expanded research capacity through training grants based in major universities in Lima. Many of these partnerships have satellite activities to study tropical diseases in Iquitos, the major city in the Peruvian Amazon, but these research and capacity building activities have largely bypassed academic institutions in Iquitos. This D43 training grant is specifically designed to address and correct this disparity, offering a collaborative research training program in partnership with the Universidad Nacional de la Amazonia Peruana (UNAP; National University of the Peruvian Amazon), the largest health education institution in the region. Our goal is to expand the local workforce of highly trained professionals with public health and infectious diseases research skills, which we propose to achieve by forming a collaborative Master?s degree program based at UNAP for six competitively selected health professionals, leading to a Master?s degree in Public Health from UNAP and a Certificate in International Research in Infectious Diseases from the consortium training program. This intensive, mentored training program with both north-south and south-south training components will be led by faculty from four collaborating institutions (UNAP, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia [the leading biomedical research university in Peru, located in Lima], Tulane, and Johns Hopkins). The program will be fully integrated with the standard Peruvian training program for health professionals, allowing for trainees to complete their academic and field service requirements while benefiting from the intensive training during programed gap periods and during the standard two-year MPH program at UNAP, while adding less than six months to their total training period. The majority of the training will be conducted locally at UNAP through training modules and online components, although three months of the initial training period will be carried out at Johns Hopkins as part of the Summer Institute of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and the Summer Institute of Tropical Medicine and Public Health. We will supplement the two-year MPH program at UNAP with complementary, short-term training modules led by Tulane, Johns Hopkins, and UPCH faculty that will be open to all MPH students in the UNAP program, expanding the impact of the training program to approximately 80 additional trainees. Working closely with UNAP faculty, we will integrate new program content into the existing MPH curriculum, providing sustainable, ongoing benefits for future UNAP MPH classes. MPH trainees will conclude their training by taking a leading role in writing and assembling a CONCYTEC proposal (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología, e Innovación Tecnológica [Nacional Counsel on Science, Technology, and Technological Innovation], the premier scientific funding agency in Peru) under the direction of a mentoring team. One-month short courses during Years 2-5 for training community field workers and laboratory support staff will also be offered, expanding the pool of research program support staff in Iquitos."
"9548457","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments."
"9443676","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Eating disorders (EDs) affect approximately 5% of the population and have a variety of adverse effects on mental and physical health. The treatment of disordered eating has progressed in recent years but further progress will depend in part on improving the field's understanding of eating disorder psychopathology. The cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) model of EDs has garnered substantial support but this framework does not sufficiently address two domains that appear to have a major impact on disordered eating. We call the first domain Weight History, which consists of premorbid body mass, the discrepancy between highest ever and current body weight (weight suppression, WS) and current BMI (which is often at very low, unhealthy levels). We have shown that WS and BMI (and their interaction) are robust predictors of many ED characteristics and that these relationships are not sufficiently accounted for by the CBT model. The second domain involves brain reward and inhibitory responses to palatable food cues. Evidence indicates that a continuum exists, with the poles anchored by the opposing responses to food cues of restricting anorexic patients and overweight binge eaters (with the former showing reward hypo-activation and inhibitory hyper-activation and the latter showing the reverse). Yet little known about how these abnormal patterns contribute to ED psychopathology. Because the variables comprising both domains are continuous in nature, and because the current application will study ED individuals regardless of DSM diagnosis, the proposed research is consistent with RDoC recommendations. We test the hypotheses that the two domains will be cross-sectionally related to eating disorder psychopathology, will predict future weight gain, ED symptomatology and course and that brain activation in reward and inhibitory regions of interest will mediate the predictive effects of Weight History variables on weight change and ED outcomes. These hypotheses will be tested among 96 ED individuals receiving treatment in any level of outpatient care. At baseline they will be assessed using standardized measures of Weight History and ED psychopathology and will undergo structural and functional MRI using a paradigm aimed at measuring their reward and inhibitory activation to food pictures in regions of interest. The measures of weight and ED symptomatology will be repeated at 3 and 6-month follow-ups. The proposed research has substantial potential to identify new sources of ED psychopathology that can be translated into novel treatments for these treatment-resistant disorders."
"9559361","ABSTRACT The ultimate goal of this project is CLIP-CT, an FDA-cleared and CE-marked smartphone-based test (?30 min) for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections in women in over-the-counter (OTC) and point-of-care (POC) settings. CT is the most common bacterial cause of sexually transmitted infections, with almost 3 million new cases in the US each year. Untreated women, mostly in the 15-24 age group, are at high risk of serious sequelae including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. CT infections are curable with a single pill, but the fact that they are asymptomatic in up to 90% of those infected necessitates screening of high-risk populations using accurate testing methods. Currently recommended Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (NAATs) are expensive and have slow turnaround times, severely limiting their applicability for expanding testing coverage. Rapid POC tests can curb disease transmission by enabling a same-day test and treat approach and immediate partner notification. An OTC test that can also be used in POC settings will also expand testing to the large swath of at-risk women who do not seek testing due to embarrassment/confidentiality concerns. Luminostics' CLIP-CT is based on the use of nanophosphors ? persistent luminescent nanoparticles ? as lateral flow assay (LFA) reporters in an immunoassay for CT. A phone case-like smartphone adapter, in combination with a mobile app, is used for result readout and analysis from the nanophosphor-LFA using the phone's flash and camera. Current colorimetric LFAs for CT are >95% specific due to the availability of good monoclonal antibodies, but have very poor clinical sensitivity due to their high limit of detection (LOD). We hypothesized that the vastly improved LOD of nanophosphor-LFAs compared to colorimetric LFAs could result in clinical sensitivities approaching NAATs (i.e., >90%). We obtained initial validation for this hypothesis in Phase I studies, where CLIP-CT prototypes with a 100-fold lower LOD than an FDA-cleared colorimetric LFA for CT achieved a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 95% compared to an FDA-cleared NAAT in a small retrospective clinical. Having validated the feasibility of nanophosphor-LFAs for sensitive CT detection, the following Specific Aims are proposed for Phase II: Aim 1 will iteratively design, develop and validate the ancillary hardware and software components of CLIP- CT around the Phase I-developed assay. Aim 2 will perform comprehensive analytical performance studies and a human factors validation study. In Aim 3, the clinical performance of CLIP-CT will be validated in a large (n=1,250) clinical study using prospectively collected specimens. Luminostics has assembled a team of bioengineers, chemists, software engineers, microbiologists, clinicians, and manufacturing experts to maximize the odds of success. The expected outcome of this Phase II project is the significant de-risking of the final trial targeting FDA 510(k) OTC clearance for CLIP-CT and the further validation of nanophosphor-LFAs as a platform technology with potential applications in a variety of medical conditions that could use more sensitive POC tests."
"9456603","Abstract Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a T cell hypersensitivity skin disease and is associated with weakened skin barrier. People with mutations in genes involved in tissue barrier fitness are predisposed towards inflammatory diseases, but most susceptible individuals do not develop the diseases, suggesting that there exist regulatory immune mechanisms. We have developed an animal model to identify the regulatory immune circuit that prevents AD. Absence of innate IL-17+ ?? T (T??17) cells results in spontaneous AD with all major hallmarks of human AD, placing these cells as the apex regulator of skin homeostasis. In the chronic AD stage, distinct CD4+ T helper effector subsets of constrained clonotypes dominate. Skin Th17 and Th22 cells are commensal bacteria (CB)- dependent, highly restricted in T cell antigen receptor (TCR) repertoire, and some of the clonotypes are extensively expanded in normal and diseased skin. Coincidently, type 2 cytokine secreting innate lymphoid cells 2 (ILC2) expand, which sets up an amplifying autofeedback loop with T cells to chronically inflame the skin. The following model of AD progression will be tested: 1. Regulatory stage: Dermal T??17 cells and ?? T cells survey skin homeostasis and barrier integrity by monitoring dermal APCs. T??17 and Th2 cells seed the skin early in life. T??17 cells, CB and local DCs coordinately promote barrier integrity through crosstalk with keratinocytes. Meanwhile, polyclonal Th2 cells are positioned to induce an allergic response towards invading pathogens. During the colonization of skin by CB, a symbiotic immune response ensues with V?4+ CB-specific CD4+ T cells expanding and differentiating into `non-pathogenic' skin resident IL-17+ T cells. 2. Elicitation stage: When T??17 cells are compromised, the barrier is degraded over time with an attendant leakage of CB and enhanced necroptosis, leading to the release of skin antigens that activate Th2 cells, and DAMPs, the most critical being IL-33. In conjunction with TSLP released by keratinocyte under stress, IL-33 drives ILC2 expansion, which further amplifies Th2 cells. Activated ILC2 and Th2 cells, in turn unleash mast cells. Together, excess type 2 cytokine production recruits eosinophils. Some tissue-resident, Th17 cells become activated and promote neutrophil recruitment. 3. Pathogenic stage: During the acute phase, IL-17 release further recruits neutrophils and amplifies the inflammatory cascade that leads to epithelial barrier damage. Inflammation and antigen release from damaged skin activates oligoclonal T cells in the skin dLNs and/or in lesional skin sites. IL-1, IL-6, IL-23, Ahr ligands and TNF? released during inflammation induces skin-resident Th17 cells to expand and acquire a `pathogenic' dual IL-17/22+ phenotypes, whereas the emergent Th22 cells represent an immune countermeasure to repair damaged skin. By mapping central cellular interactions and molecular regulatory network in spontaneous mouse models of AD, the origin of AD and the nature of pathogenic T cells can be understood, paving the way towards identification of T cell skin antigens responsible for AD."

"9523654","Microtubule stabilizing agents (MSAs) are some of the most widely used and effective therapies available for the treatment of solid tumors. However, their utility is compromised by innate and acquired drug resistance. The taccalonolides (taccas) are a mechanistically unique class of MSAs that circumvent multiple clinically relevant forms of drug resistance. Multiple potent taccas identified by our laboratories have effective antitumor activity in drug sensitive and resistant in vivo models but suffer from a narrow therapeutic window. This project will develop an in depth understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this class of MSAs that will yield taccas with an optimal in vivo profile for future clinical development. The recent generation of a crystal structure of a tacca bound to tubulin heterodimers has provided unprecedented insight into the tacca pharmacophore, which will be used to experimentally define the critical residues on tubulin and moieties on the taccas that mediate their novel mechanism of microtubule stabilizing activity. We have also identified sites on the tacca skeleton that can be modified semi-synthetically to improve compound stability and optimize their pharmacokinetic profile and antitumor actions. Functional fluorescent and biotin-tagged taccas have been generated that will allow, for the first time, direct detection of the taccas in vitro and in vivo that will be instrumental in understanding the uptake, distribution, and target binding of this unique MSA. In addition to generating taccas with a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile and evaluating their efficacy in molecularly defined patient derived tumor xenograft and syngeneic models, we will also determine biomarkers associated with response to this novel class of MSAs. Expression analysis in a panel of molecularly defined triple negative breast cancer cell lines identified signaling pathways that correlate with the cytotoxic efficacy of the taccas. We will further evaluate whether intrinsic alterations in these signaling pathways are biomarkers of drug response and, reciprocally, follow up on data indicating that the taccas can also alter the functional consequences of these signaling pathways. These studies are significant in that they will lead, in the future, to the generation of a clinical lead candidate for the treatment of drug resistant solid tumors and a greater understanding of their mechanism of action and predictors of response."
"9456597","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis (OA), particularly knee OA, is among the top 15 causes of disability and the main reason for joint replacement at a cost of over $30 billion/year. Knee OA is typically a slowly progressive disorder but for a recently identified subset the disease progresses with dramatic rapidity. These individuals develop more frequent and severe knee pain, and are 16 times more likely to require a total knee replacement.] Since this is a novel observation, we do not yet know whether individuals experiencing [accelerated knee OA (AKOA) is a distinct disease or an accelerated form of knee OA. Determining factors that differentiate or identify AKOA could lead to preventive strategies and uncover therapeutic targets. Our goals are to test if AKOA can be uniquely characterized by: (i) anatomical characteristics associated with injuries and abnormal loading, (ii) biochemical factors that compromise structures (glucose homeostasis, inflammation), (iii) certain types of instigating pathology, and (iiii) distinct pathological processes.] To achieve these goals we propose to perform a nested case-control study with three groups selected from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. The Osteoarthritis Initiative is an outstanding study that conducts annual evaluations; including magnetic resonance images, x- rays, and clinical measurements; of people with or at risk for knee OA. The three groups we propose to examine will be [1) knees that develop AKOA, 2) knees that develop common OA,] and 3) knees with no OA. AKOA will be defined as knees that progress from no radiographic OA at baseline to end-stage OA within 48- months. Common knee OA will be defined as knees with no radiographic OA at baseline but increase in radiographic scoring within 48 months (excluding those defined as AKOA). Finally, no OA will be knees with no radiographic OA and do not progress. We will assess annual MR images in the sample to identify and quantify structural changes in the knee. We will also perform assays to measure [baseline glucose balance and systemic] inflammation. Finally, we will also use serum and urine biomarker data provided by the OAI to measure bone and cartilage turnover. [These findings could lead to preventive strategies and uncover therapeutic targets. Furthermore, the insights generated from this study may generalize to regular knee OA, expanding the overall field.]"
"9523410","Exposure to ambient air pollution has been associated with both cognitive impairment and cardiac dysfunction and a post-mortem study reported evidence of accumulation of amyloid among people living in cities with high levels of ambient pollution. Whether exposure to high levels of air pollution accelerates the formation of aggregates is unknown. We propose a 3 month controlled exposure experiment in Alzheimer?s prone mice carrying the single mutation in the in the Presenilin-1 gene (PSEN1) (PS1?E9) or the double mutation in the APPswe + the PS1?E9 (APPswe/PS1?E9). All mice are in the C57/Bl6J background and C57/Bl6J wild-type mice will serve as controls. Mice will be exposed beginning at age 3 months to evaluate the impact of concentrated fine particulate matter (PM2.5) versus filtered air (FA) exposure on brain and cardiac structure and function. Mice will be studied at two time points: immediately after the exposure and at the end of the 3-month exposure. Another set of mice will be exposed to PM2.5 for 3 month than for FA for 3 more months. A control group will be exposed to FA for 6 month. We hypothesize that Alzheimer?s prone mice exposed to PM2.5 will develop: 1) a greater quantity of aggregates in the specific anatomical regions of the brain and heart as assessed by imaging and electron microscopy; 2) worsen brain function assessed with behavioral studies and cardiac function assessed by echocardiography, biometric measurements in-vivo and worsen calcium homeostasis in primary neurons and contractile function and calcium handling in isolated cardiomyocytes in-vitro. We also hypothesize that exposure to PM will accelerate amyloid pathology by inducing oxidative stress."
"9458036","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Keratins are the most abundant proteins in surface epithelia, in which they form cytoplasmic networks of 10 nm wide intermediate filaments (IFs). Keratins are encoded by an evolutionarily conserved multigene family, with 54 individual members subdivided into two major types (I and II). The pairwise regulation of type I and type II keratins in epithelia reflects a strict heteropolymerization requirement. In addition, keratin gene are regulated in an epithelial tissue-type and differentiation-specific fashion, the functional bass of which is only partly understood. Our efforts in this project are focused on defining the properties and function of the type I keratins 16 and 17 (K16, K17), and type II keratins 6a and 6b (K6a, K6b) in skin epithelia, which are of particular interest because of their dual involvement in human disease. First, genetic mutations in Krt6a/b, Krt16 or Krt17 cause genodermatoses with pathological features reflecting grossly altered skin homeostasis, including pachyonychia congenita (PC), palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK), and steatocystoma multiplex. The main tissues affected by these disorders are ectoderm-derived epithelial appendages and glabrous skin, and represent the sites of constitutive expression of these genes. Second, elevated expression of these keratin genes impacts the onset and course of chronic hyperproliferative and inflammatory skin diseases, e.g., psoriasis and cancer. The latter results from the massive induction of these keratin proteins in interfollicular epidermis under such abnormal circumstances, combined with their emerging role as regulators of cell growth, tissue inflammation and immune responses in skin epithelia.  During the last period of support, we discovered that a nuclear form of K17 plays a significant role in regulating the expression of genes involved in growth control, inflammation and immunity in skin keratinocytes. Going forward, we propose to: (Aim 1a) Identify the mechanisms and regulation of import/export of K17 to/from the nucleus, and identify the protein partners of K17 inside the nucleus; (Aim 1b) Map K17 protein binding sites throughout the genome of resting versus stimulated skin keratinocytes; and (Aim 1c) Generate and characterize a mouse in which K17 cannot be imported in the nucleus but is otherwise fully functional. We also showed that the PPK lesions that spontaneously arise in Krt16 null mice resemble those occurring in PC patients and are in part the result of hypoactive Keap1-Nrf2 signaling. Going forward we will: (Aim 2a) Assess the consequence of expressing PC-causing missense Krt16 alleles in mouse; (Aim 2b) Define the mechanism(s) through which K16 regulates Keap1/Nrf2-dependent gene expression; and (Aim 2c) Identify other protein partners and pathways through which K16 regulates innate immunity and the skin barrier. Upon completion of this project we hope to have defined the significance of the presence of keratin 17 in the nucleus, thus paving the way for efforts to assess the general importance of this property among keratins, and to have established that activating Nrf2 function presents a genuine opportunity for the therapy of PC/PPK."
"9453629","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death among elderly individuals with obesity and diabetes. Systemic inflammation is a common pathophysiologic hallmark of aging, diabetes, and cardiovascular illness, with animal and human data suggesting that pro-inflammatory cytokines concomitantly perturb vascular and myocardial function and lead to insulin resistance and oxidative stress. Current clinical markers of inflammation (e.g., high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), oxidative stress, and obesity (e.g., body mass index; BMI) are not sufficiently sensitive in elderly individuals to identify those at high CV and metabolic risk. Indeed, systemic markers of inflammation may rise with aging in a CVD risk- or diabetes-independent fashion. Furthermore, elderly individuals with low BMI may be at paradoxically higher CVD and mortality risk, specifically those with diabetes. Establishing biomarkers that directly reflect tissue-level inflammatory processes may therefore identify elderly individuals at greatest risk for timely therapy. Our group has recently described specific histologic and molecular dermal phenotypes in diabetes that are strongly linked to microvascular function, wound healing, and systemic inflammation. Our preliminary data suggests that macrophage polarization (M1) within skin and mast cell degranulation are strongly associated with obesity- and diabetes-related phenotypes and mark diabetes-related microvascular disease (e.g., poor wound healing). In addition, we have demonstrated microcirculatory dysfunction in older diabetics using advanced cardiovascular imaging, with associations between obesity, inflammation and myocardial dysfunction. Given the overarching role of inflammation and oxidative stress in systemic vascular and metabolic dysfunction, and aging, we hypothesize that inflammatory phenotypes in the skin may provide a critical marker of systemic inflammation and its effects on CVD and metabolic risk in an elderly population. In this application, we address the central hypothesis that dermal macrophage infiltration/polarization and mast cell activation are associated with systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular remodeling, and are reversible with therapies targeting improved fitness in the elderly. We therefore propose (a) to determine the association of dermal inflammatory phenotypes with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic risk in elderly individuals with and without diabetes, (b) to quantify the relationship between dermal inflammation, skin microcirculatory dysfunction, and abnormal cardiovascular structure in elderly individuals with and without obesity and (c) to determine whether a lifestyle intervention proven to reduce systemic inflammation will impact biochemical and imaging-based markers of CVD and metabolic risk in elderly individuals with diabetes. Successful completion of the application will (1) establish skin phenotypes as a novel, minimally invasive, and reversible biomarker that directly measures ongoing CVD in the elderly and (2) further understanding of the biology of inflammation and CVD risk in an emerging elderly population."
"9640890","?    DESCRIPTION:  Chronic cocaine abuse arises as a result of persistent cocaine-induced adaptations in the function of the neurons that comprise mesolimbocortical brain reward circuits. Cocaine-induced changes in gene transcription contribute to many of these alterations in neuronal function. Furthermore cocaine exposure has been shown to dynamically alter the epigenome by regulating the expression and/or function of histone and DNA modifying enzymes. Taken together, these data have led to the hypothesis that long-lasting changes in the epigenome may underlie the persistence of cocaine-induced addictive-like behaviors. However whether specific changes in chromatin regulation are truly causative for drug-induced behavioral plasticity has remained a challenging hypothesis to test due to the lack of high-throughput in vivo methods for site-specific experimental manipulation of the epigenome. To overcome this limitation we will generate two novel Cre/loxP-conditional CRISPR/Cas9- based transgenic mouse strains in which an enzymatically dead Cas9 protein fused either to the core histone acetyltransferase domain of p300 (dCas-p300) or the KRAB repressor domain (dCas9-KRAB) is knocked into the Rosa26 locus. We have shown that gRNA-mediated recruitment of dCas9 fusions with chromatin regulators is sufficient to induce targeted histone modifications and highly specific corresponding changes in gene transcription. Now by expressing these fusion proteins in transgenic mice, we will achieve regional and temporal control of site-specific epigenome editing in the brain in vivo by intersecting Cre-dependent induction of dCas9-fusion protein expression with stereotaxic viral delivery of validated gRNAs targeting cocaine- regulated enhancers. In the R21 phase of this proposal we will first generate and characterize the conditional dCas9-p300 and dCas9-KRAB mouse strains and then conduct a proof-of-principle experiment to validate whether dCas9-mediated regulation of Fosb in neurons of the nucleus accumbens is sufficient to alter cocaine- induced locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference. In the R33 phase we will use the dCas9- p300 and dCas9-KRAB mouse strains to test the hypothesis that epigenetic sensitization of Bdnf transcription in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area promotes incubation of cocaine craving, an important rodent model for relapse. Finally to accelerate future epigenome editing studies we will first use a novel method to capture nuclei of cocaine-activated neuronal ensembles in the nucleus accumbens for chromatin profiling and then develop and functionally validate gRNAs targeting cocaine-regulated enhancers for use by the broader scientific community. Our studies will provide a novel toolbox for functional epigenomic studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying substance use disorders."
"9522288","Project Summary/Abstract Bilingualism is the norm for much of the world, and even in the United States, where monolingualism is common, at least 22% of individuals over age 5 speak a language other than English at home. However, we still do not know how to best structure the language environment to yield optimal language outcomes in bilingual children. In the current proposal, we aim to answer this fundamental question by examining the effect of dual language input on word learning in Spanish-English bilingual children with fluctuating levels of language ability. Specific Aim 1 is to examine the effect of dual language input on novel word learning. In these experiments we will contrast learning from single-language (English only) vs. dual language exposure (Spanish and English) across different types of dual-language input and for different word types. Specific Aim 2 is to examine the effect of dual language input on novel word consolidation. In these experiments, we will use eye-tracking to test whether newly-learned novel words enter into interactive dynamics with known words within and across languages. Specific Aim 3 is to examine the relationship between language ability and novel word learning under dual- language conditions. We will do so by recruiting bilingual children who occupy the full range of language abilities - from typical skills in both English and Spanish to weak skills in both languages (i.e., language impairment). This strategy will enable us to treat language ability as a continuum and to examine how it predicts novel word learning and consolidation across all experiments proposed under Aims 1 and 2. We hypothesize that dual-language input may be particularly challenging for children with weak language skills, and expect that the relationship between language ability and word-learning outcomes will vary across different types of dual-language input and different word types. Ultimately, we will be able to state whether children with weak language skills struggle more with learning from dual-language input than children with strong language skills, yielding practical recommendations for parents, clinicians, and educators. Together, our findings will have clear-cut practical consequences and far-reaching theoretical ramifications. Currently, advice to parents raising bilingual children with language impairment regarding the optimal language exposure is based on intuition rather than on solid empirical evidence. The current proposal represents the first step towards establishing empirically-grounded guidelines regarding optimal language input for bilingual children with and without language impairment. At the theoretical level, the study of code-switching has been central to the field of bilingualism, and we know a great deal about the process by which bilinguals switch languages. However, we know very little about how the different ways of switching languages influence children?s ability to learn. By focusing on the learning process itself, the proposed project can contribute vital information to the code-switching literature, while at the same time shedding light on how dual language input may shape lexical learning."
"9464509","Project Summary/Abstract The loss of motor function that occurs with aging is closely associated with adverse health outcomes. In recent years, published findings strongly suggest that malfunction and degeneration of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the synapse formed between ?-motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers, contributes to age-related motor dysfunction. As the final output of the somatic motor system, degeneration of the NMJ inevitably results in degeneration of motor axons and atrophy of muscle fibers, thus affecting voluntary movement. Thus, it is critical to identify factors that function to maintain and repair the NMJ. Using an R56 grant provided by NIA, our lab has identified the fibroblast growth factor binding protein 1 (FGFBP1) as a promising candidate factor secreted by muscle fibers to preserve and restore the integrity of NMJs during aging. FGFBP1 functions to chaperone FGF ligands from the extracellular matrix to cognate receptors. In this manner, it enhances FGF signaling. We have found that while FGFBP1 concentrates at NMJs in young adult mice, it progressively decreases during normal aging and in SOD1G93A mice, a mouse model for ALS. Using knockout mice, we observed that FGFBP1 expression is required to slow aging of NMJs and motor deficits during normal aging. Furthermore, FGFBP1 deletion in mice expressing SOD1G93A, a model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), accelerates NMJ degeneration, disease progression and death. These initial discoveries strongly suggest that preventing loss of endogenous of FGFBP1 during aging may be sufficient to slow degeneration of NMJs, and thus preserve motor function. To test this hypothesis, we proposed three specific aims that build on each other. In aim 1, we test the hypothesis that motor deficits in mice deficient for FGFBP1 result from cellular, molecular, and physiological changes at NMJs. In aim 2, we will seek to identify molecular mechanisms that inhibit FGFBP1 expression in aging muscles. In aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that FGFBP1 is sufficient to prevent and reverse age-related changes of NMJs. These aims are designed to uncover the initial changes that precipitate aging of NMs, the molecular factors that result in decreased FGFBP1 expression in aging muscle, and the therapeutic potential of FGFBP1 in preserving NMJs and motor function."
"9540206","Project Summary Antimicrobial innovation has slowed to a crawl while an epidemic of antimicrobial-resistant infections surges, threatening the public health. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a novel natural product antifungal, selvamicin, targeting drug-resistant fungal infections. This molecule was identified from a symbiotic animal environment. Growing evidence suggests this is a rich and untapped source of novel compounds. More importantly, the molecules from these symbiotic environments exhibit an extremely high rate of both biological activity and animal safety, presumably due to the evolutionary selection of the symbiotic relationship between the antibiotic producing microbe and animal. Consistent with this hypothesis, preliminary data with selvamicin demonstrates promising broad-spectrum activity against drug-resistant fungi in vitro and in pilot animal studies coupled with the absence of a toxicity signal from early cell and whole animal drug exposure studies. The proposed Phase 1 studies will further explore the feasibility for clinical development of this lead antifungal via three IND enabling aims. Aims 1 and 2 will expand preclinical efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology investigation. Aim 3 will focus on scale up compound production and physiochemical characterization needed for subsequent GLP production required for Phase 2 toxicology analysis and early human studies. The milestones for success will clearly discern the therapeutic potential of selvamicin by defining the the murine PK/PD target in standard FDA utilized models, the safety and therapeutic window for standard end organs, and advance production and chemical analysis toward GLP/GMP capacity for Phase 2 development."
"9456523","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammasomes are protein complexes that facilitate the maturation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) -1ß and IL-18, which are important for innate immune responses. Nevertheless, for maintaining homeostasis balance and temporary inflammasome activation is essential, since uncontrolled and excessive cytokine production has been linked to rheumatic and other inflammatory diseases. The first step of inflammasome activation is the sensing of pathogens and cellular danger signals by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and the NOD-like receptor containing a pyrin domain (NLRP) 3 is one of them. Upon activation, NLRP3 recruits the adaptor ASC and the effector caspase-1, which subsequently processes IL-1¿ and IL-18 into their biologically active forms. However, recently the mitochondrial MAVS protein has been proposed to also function as an inflammasome adaptor and caspases-11 and -8 were implicated as alternative effectors for NLRP3 inflammasomes during bacterial infections. Nevertheless, their contribution and relevance to NLRP3 inflammasome activation in rheumatic and inflammatory diseases has not been investigated yet. The proper function of NLRP3 is crucial for human health, since defects in the NLRP3 inflammasome regulation are associated with several inflammatory diseases, including Cryopyrinopathies and crystal arthropathies. While hereditary mutations render NLRP3 constitutively active in Cryopyrinopathies, an excess of danger signals in the form of monosodium urate (MSU) crystal precipitates in the joint triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation and an acute local inflammatory response that causes gouty arthritis. Hence, in both diseases the uncontrolled activation of NLRP3 leads to excessive IL-1ß production. Consequently, blocking IL-1ß improves disease symptoms and patient outcomes. However, IL-1ß is crucial for innate immune responses and elimination of IL- 1ß altogether can also impair host defense. Thus, it is crucial to gain a detailed understanding of the NLRP3 inflammasomes regulation in Cryopyrinopathies and crystal arthropathies in order to develop specific NLRP3 inflammasome targeted therapies. I propose to study the function of MAVS and caspases-11 and -8 in NLRP3 inflammasome linked Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), which is a Cryopyrinopathy, and MSU crystal-induced gout by utilizing in vivo mouse models. I expect that the results from this study will have widespread implications for future therapies of MWS and gout but also for other NLRP3-associated diseases and will concurrently contribute to a better understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in NLRP3 inflammasome biology. My long-term career goal is to build an academic research group focused on understanding immunologic mechanisms underlying the development of rheumatic and inflammatory diseases. I belief that this proposal is an ideal training vehicle for a K01 Mentored Scientist Development Award, as I will become proficient in mouse models of rheumatic and inflammatory diseases, as well as translational immunology, thereby developing my own niche as I begin to establish an independent academic career."
"9520142","Project Summary/Abstract Project 1 will generate and use mouse models for studying how exposure to hepatotoxic Superfund substances causes fatty liver disease and its different manifestations, including inflammation, fibrosis and cancer. It has become increasingly clear that exposure to many industrial and environmental toxicants can cause toxicant- associated fatty liver disease (TAFLD) and its more serious form, toxicant-associated steatohepatitis (TASH), whose pathological signs are strikingly similar to those of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non- alcoholic stateohepatits (NASH), respectively. As the pathogenic mechanisms underlying to TAFLD and TASH are poorly understood, we posit that better insight to toxicant-induced liver diseases can be gained from studying them along with NAFLD and NASH. Moreover, pre-existing NAFLD can increase the susceptibility of the liver to toxicant induced damage, further justifying the study of this metabolic condition that can progress to NASH or TASH and then to liver cirrhosis and cancer, diseases whose incidence is greater in economically disadvantaged Indian- and Mexican-American populations. During the past project period we obtained exciting and important preliminary results according to which the development and clinical progression of NASH and TASH are strongly modulated by two different populations of B lymphocytres, spleen-derived B2 B cells that promote fibrotic progression and IgA-producing plasmocytes that attenuate the onset of liver fibrosis, but favor the establishment of an immunosuppressive microenvironment permissive to the growth and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Correspondingly, the specific targeting of IgA+ plasmocytes results in immune rejection of established HCC. To better understand the role of these B populations in the development and progression of NASH and TASH and to generate a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of toxicant-and obesity-induced liver cancer we will: 1) Define the pathways responsible for B cell recruitment into toxicant-damaged steatotic livers; 2) Determine how TASH and NASH trigger IgA class switch recombination (CSR) in liver-infiltrating B cells; 3) Determine how IgA+ plasmocytes attenuate NASH- and TASH-associated liver fibrosis; 4) Determine the role of T cell subsets and microbiota in the development of NASH and TASH; 5) identify secreted metabolites that along with IgA can be used for non-invasive detection of liver fibrosis; 6) determine the role of IgA+ plasmocytes in NASH and TASH progression to HCC. Our ability to accomplish these goals and gain a much better understanding of the immune mechanisms that affect the pathogenesis of NASH and TASH will be greatly enhanced by our research cores and the close collaborative interactions with other research projects."
"9520124","PROJECT 3: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many hazardous chemicals at Superfund sites have been linked to adverse health effects, but their toxicological mechanisms remain poorly understood. This project will apply innovative analytical technologies to dissect and simplify the complexities associated with analyzing the toxicological mechanisms associated with exposure to chemical mixtures and the Exposome. We have developed a chemical proteomic technology termed reactivity-based protein profiling (RBPP) that enables the mapping of direct interactions of reactive SRP chemicals with protein targets in complex biological systems. This is a novel and very innovative technology that enables a comprehensive assessment of how chemicals interact with specific molecular targets directly in complex mammalian physiology, which in-turn informs the types of downstream biochemical and pathological effects that may result from chemical exposure. This technology and the information revealed from using it will vastly expand our knowledge of: 1) novel toxicological mechanisms of individual SRP chemicals; 2) common pathways that may be targeted by multiple SRP chemicals; and 3) toxicological mechanisms that may arise from exposure to chemical mixtures and other factors in the Exposome. We hypothesize that dissecting out the individual targets of chemicals and mapping common pathways that are targeted across multiple chemicals will enable us to identify particularly important toxicological mechanisms associated exposure to complex chemical mixtures. We have been using RBPP to profile direct protein targets of many widely used environmental chemicals of concern. We have found that several protein targets involved in fatty acid degradation, metabolism, and steroidogenesis are directly and commonly inhibited by a strikingly large number of reactive environmental chemicals. These commonly targeted pathways are likely to result in adverse health effects since inhibiting the burning of fat will lead to accumulation of fat in tissues and inhibiting steroid hormone degradation will lead to accumulation in both hormones like testosterone and cortisol which may have behavioral and tumor promoting effects. We hypothesize that cumulative exposure to these reactive SRP chemicals and the inhibition of protein targets involved in fat and steroid metabolism will directly impact lipid and steroid levels in vivo in mice and humans. We propose to apply innovative analytical platforms to map proteome-wide targets of reactive SRP chemicals to reveal novel toxicological mechanisms with a particular focus on understanding how exposure to SRP chemical mixtures may synergize to impact fat and steroid metabolism. This project will directly address Problems 1, 3, and 4 on addressing the problem of: 1) mixtures, 2) complexities of chemicals operating through unique and overlapping mechanisms, and 3) identifying risks associated with chemical exposure in vulnerable populations, through using our innovative RBPP methods to simplify our understanding of toxicological mechanisms underlying chemical mixtures."
"9463336","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Skeletal muscle as the largest organ in human body is prone to many disorders. Muscular dystrophies, muscles wasting due to cachexia or sarcopenia and muscle mass loss due to injuries are among most common types of muscle disorders. Despite many advances in understanding the pathologic basis of these disorders, therapeutic options in these cases are unfortunately very limited or ineffective. Meanwhile, using stem cell based therapies for skeletal muscle repair has been considered as one of the potential candidates in these cases. For this reason, pluripotent stem cells are the best candidate due to their unparalleled differentiation and self-renewal potentials. With the successful isolation of human embryonic stem (ES) cells and later on, generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) from the somatic cells, an unprecedented opportunity has been discovered for disease modeling and designing patient specific cell therapies. Therefore, differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (i.e. hES/ iPS cells) toward skeletal muscle lineage has been the focus of attention for developmental studies as well as stem cell based regenerative therapies for muscle disorders. Indeed, in the recent years, few methods have been developed for derivation of skeletal myogenic precursors from hES/iPS cells such as myogenic gene over-expression or mesenchymal differentiation through long-term cultures. However, these approaches cannot be utilized for clinical purposes due to unsafe cell preps using viruses or due to other shortcomings such as low efficiency or impurity of the myogenic cells. These problems mostly arise from the lack of a prospective approach to study chronological differentiation of hES/iPS cells toward skeletal muscle lineage, as most of these studies evaluate myogenic differentiation of the pluripotent stem cells retrospectively. Therefore, in this research application, experiments have been designed to overcome these shortcomings. In the 1st aim of this application knock-in reporter cell lines in human iPS cells for important genes involved in early skeletal muscle development (PAX7, Myf5) is being generated. For this purpose RNA guided Cas9 mediated homologous recombination approach is utilized to incorporate a 2A- GFP or tdTomato reporter. This will provide a unique opportunity to study the temporal pattern of skeletal myogenesis during in vitro differentiation of the human ES/iPS cells. The 2nd aim of this application is to define directed differentiation of hES/iPS cells using chemical library screen. Moreover, purified myogenic precursors will be fully characterized for surface markers and gene expression in order to determine the signature profile of the myogenic precursors derived from hES/iPS cells. This will allow applying this methodology to any other human iPS cell line without need to incorporate a reporter in the genome. The 3rd aim of this application will focus on evaluation of in vivo regeneration potential of human iPS derived myogenic cells in mice models of two common muscle pathologies (muscular dystrophies and muscle loss). This will provide invaluable data for the application of human iPS derived cells for muscle disease modeling or therapeutics."
"9476886","Project Summary Recent findings from CREATE III indicate that a simple to use Personalized Reminder Information and Social Management System (PRISM 1.0) software application designed for older adults was beneficial in terms of enhancing social support, reducing feelings of social isolation and increasing general well-being among older people living alone, ?at risk? for social isolation. Participants also indicated that they enjoyed using the system; it made life easier and was easy to use. PRISM was designed to support social connectivity, procedural and prospective memory, knowledge about topics and resources (relevant to seniors) and resource access. In the proposed study, we will evaluate an expanded version of PRISM (PRISM 2.0) with diverse populations of older adults in diverse contexts. PRISM 2.0 will have expanded functionality (e.g., videoconferencing) and new platforms (tablet), be available in Spanish, and evaluated in rural locations, assisted living facilities and senior housing units. The system will be compared to a standard computer tablet alone control condition. The goal of the study is to gather rigorous systematic evidence about the value of the enhanced version of PRISM with other older adults who live in other contexts. We will also gather data to identify individual difference factors that affect use, usability, acceptance and adoption of the PRISM 2.0 system and longitudinal data on the benefits of the system. Participants (aged 65+) will be randomly assigned, following baseline assessment, to one of the two conditions. We will build on the protocols developed for the PRISM 1.0 trial. The trial intervention period will be 9-months. A battery of measures (refined from the PRISM 1.0 trial) that includes demographic information, attitudes towards technology, computer proficiency, technology, computer and Internet experience, functional independence and well-being, social support/isolation, and quality of life will be administered at baseline, and 5 and 9 months post randomization. We will also assess cognitive abilities at baseline and 9 months. We will also conduct interviews at 5 and 9 months and a telephone interview at 15 months. The living contexts will vary by site according to site characteristics (e.g., FSU has access to rural populations) to allow us to examine a broader and more diverse sample and living contexts. Phase 1 will involve: cross-site focus groups with a sample of older adults to obtain their initial perceptions of the system and feedback about proposed applications (N = 75); pilot testing; refinement of the system and training protocols; and modification of PRISM materials. Phase 2 will be the actual implementation of the trial (N = 258).  "
"9521299","PROJECT SUMMARY Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) patients experiencing their first neurological clinical episode related to Central Nervous System (CNS) inflammation represent a unique opportunity to study the earliest immunological events associated with CNS inflammation prior to treatment initiation. Our laboratory has acquired the largest human sample repository of CIS patients experiencing their first clinical episode. Our preliminary data using state-of- the-art cellular and genetic phenotyping demonstrate extensive B cell dysregulation within our untreated, CIS cohort compared to controls including an expanded population of a B cell subtype called CD27high plasmablasts in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood at the time of their first documented clinical attack. In fact, those patients with CD27high plasmablast expansion at the time of their first clinical attack were the only ones who had documented exacerbations over the next two years. In addition, circulating CD27high plasmablasts utilizing particular antibody genes tend to produce antibodies that bind neuronal antigens. These findings have prompted us to question whether CD27high plasmablasts are involved in the autoreactivity associated with this subset of CIS patients at high risk to convert to MS at the time of their first documented clinical attack. We are also investigating whether Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS) patients, who display CNS inflammation similar to CIS patients but without clinical symptoms also exhibit expansion of CD27high plasmablasts that produce anti-neuronal antibodies. The focus of this project will facilitate new mechanistic insights into the contribution of CD27high plasmablasts in early CNS inflammation."

A small grant competition will encourage scientists to join the area and will stimulate new research through small scale pilots. This network grant will support development of the area through methods workshops and an outside mentorship program. Short, intensive workshops will focus on training researchers at all stages in the collection and analysis of various emerging behavioral (e.g., health-related, social, economic) and biological (e.g., neurochemical, genetic, hormonal) measures. The development of these skills is currently difficult to achieve in traditional single discipline training programs, but will be essential for taking advantage of the growing number of large multivariate and multi-level integrative datasets generated by this area in the future. In general the network will focus on investing in the sustainability of this field by ensuring that graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and junior and senior faculty are invited to participate in all activities. Workshops, meetings, small pilot grants, and collaboration initiatives will facilitate the transition from a small group of individuals managing network activities to a strong field of researchers leading future work in this area. After completion of activities, this emerging area will be in better position for network members to pursue funding to support the network in the future using more traditional mechanisms."
"9559447","Abstract  Transition-age youth (TAY) from ages 18-26 are especially vulnerable to substance use, misuse, and substance use disorder (SUD). This developmental period, termed the ?age of instability and emerging adulthood includes tasks such as leaving home, entering college; identifying vocational goals; working for the first time; body and sexuality changes; coalescing with a peer group; and for some, aging out of foster care or state custody, which end at age 18. The emerging- adulthood period is prime for experimentation with substances and the development of SUD, and associated problems such as binge drinking, driving under the influence, accidents, fighting and violence, HIV, gang involvement, suicide and self-harm, and vulnerability to date-rape and other sexual assault. A major challenge for TAY is the capacity to regulate their emotions, given the hormone changes and emotional intensity of this stage of life. Indeed, substance use is often described as a short-term way to regulate emotion and there is a long-standing literature documenting the association between emotion regulation (ER) problems and SUD. The importance of ER is also grounded in the developmental literature in which ER is identified as a core skill that is critical to the successful transition to adulthood. The initial component of ER, accurate identification of emotion, is itself a major challenge, especially for people with SUD as they are often not aware of their feelings or confused about them due to the nature of the disorder as well as mental health disorders that often co-occur with SUD. In our phase 1 project we developed and evaluated a mobile app that uses exciting new technology (automated emotion detection) to help TAY better recognize their emotions in relation to SUD variables. We found highly positive results in our phase 1 feasibility / pilot study and are now proposing a phase 2 project to continue this work. In phase 2 we plan to enhance and continue to develop the app features and user experience based on end-user feedback and our expert consultant team. Phase 2 also includes a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the app among TAY with SUD. They will have six weeks to use the app in their natural environment, such as home, and we will conduct pre- and post-evaluation using validated instruments to compare outcomes between two conditions: the app condition and a control-app condition. The primary outcomes are substance use and emotion regulation. We also plan to evaluate end-user satisfaction with the app and have a final round of feedback at the end of phase 2 as well as explore app metrics. The app product we envision would have major public health and clinical impact. It could help improve TAY?s ability to become more aware of their emotions and understand them in relation to SUD via an exciting emotion-focused technology innovation. If the product is successful it could also be expanded to other populations. Our stellar team includes experts in SUD, TAY, clinical innovations, technology, and app development."
"9520119","CORE B: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The new Community Engagement Core - Water Equity Science Shop (CEC-WESS) of the UC Berkeley Superfund Research Program (the Center) seeks to address drinking water quality problems in California that exist despite sophisticated statewide water infrastructure and federal water quality laws. Industrial and agricultural activities in California have resulted in elevated levels of chemical contaminants in drinking water such as nitrate, arsenic, pesticides, and chromium. Among small, rural, and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, degraded infrastructure and a lack of resources to treat contamination problems result in drinking water that does not meet regulatory standards for health and safety. Residents served by water systems with fewer than five service connections and those using private wells face even greater challenges, as these systems are not regulated under existing drinking water laws and little monitoring exists to evaluate contamination problems. The fact that communities with elevated concentrations of contaminants in their drinking water are largely low income and disproportionately Latino raises environmental justice concerns.  The CEC-WESS will address these water equity challenges by leveraging the biomedical and water quality engineering expertise of Center to address the needs, priorities and concerns of community-based non- governmental organizations (NGOs) working to address water quality concerns in disadvantaged communities. The overall approach of the CEC-WESS draws on community-based participatory research methods and European Science Shops as models that advance sustainable and socially-just strategies to improve drinking water quality by engaging community-based organizations throughout the research process-- from the identification of research questions, to the implementation of study protocols, and the interpretation and dissemination of results. The CEC-WESS will conduct a needs assessment to identify community-driven research needs that directly support to our NGO partners' efforts to identify solutions to prevent and reduce harmful drinking water exposures in disadvantaged communities. In partnership with the NGO Community Water Center, the CEC-WESS will conduct a pilot Domestic Well Intervention Study that tests the drinking water quality of domestic well users living in areas of high ground water contamination, the quality of locally- available alternative sources of drinking water, and the effectiveness of point-of-use treatment technologies. The pilot study will include a community-driven results communication strategy that delivers individual test results to participants and leverages study data to impact state water policy and future intervention efforts. In so doing, the CEC-WESS will fill key knowledge gaps regarding drinking water quality and effective interventions to vulnerable users who are beyond the purview of current water quality regulation, and empower domestic well households to take individual action to reduce their exposure as well as collective action to advocate for longer term solutions."
"9486900","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A long history of developmental biology research into avian and mammalian digit formation has defined the cellular and molecular underpinnings of the digit separation process. At a cellular level, apoptosis of the interdigital mesenchyme, as well as differential digit and interdigital growth, mediate digit separation. The interdigital apoptosis is initiated by decreasing FGF8 expression in the overlying epidermis which triggers a cascade of molecular changes in the interdigital mesenchyme, ultimately resulting in apoptosis and regression of the interdigital tissue. A failure of this process is thought to underlie a number of congenital abnormalities in humans with fused digits, a condition observed in 3-10 per 10 thousand births. Through our work on Grhl3-/- mice, we discovered an entirely new epithelial-based mechanism for digit separation. Our data suggest that while interdigital apoptosis is required for digit separation it is not sufficient. We identified the formation of a small multilayered epithelial tongue structure (referred to as the interdigital epithelial tongue; IET) proximally at the separating digit junctions. For normal digit formation, the epithelia within this structure needs to undergo bifurcation concomitant with the interdigital mesenchymal cell death. The hypotheses in this application are: 1) that as the interdigital juncture epithelium moves proximally and from the dorsal and ventral surfaces in response to interdigital mesenchyme cell death, a multilayered epithelial tongue structure forms at its leading edge; and 2) that a GRHL3-controlled pathway is required for bifurcation of the interdigital epithelial tongue to allow digit separation. We propose two Aims to test these hypotheses. In Aim 1, we will characterize the cellular mechanisms responsible for movement and bifurcation of the interdigital epithelial tongue. In Aim 2, we will define a GRHL3-regulated molecular pathway responsible for bifurcation of the interdigital epithelial tongue. These studies are significant and innovative because they define a previously unrecognized cellular and molecular pathway required for normal digit separation."
"9454080","Project Summary The major functions of the Study Design and Clinical Research Core are to (1) serve clinical and basic science investigators in digestive diseases with comprehensive study design consultation and support, (2) assist DDC investigators in all aspects of the acquisition of clinical specimens required for their research in digestive diseases, and (3) support comprehensive data analyses and interpretation of basic, translation, clinical and epidemiological studies. The Core has been highly productive and beneficial for members of the TMC DDC. In the last 4 years, 29 members used the study design consultation and support services, 49 DDC members used the statistical component of the Core, and 13 members obtained help with specimen acquisition and handling. This Core is primarily a DDC Core; 75% of Core users in the last 2 years were either full or associate members of the DDC. Over 50 members anticipate using this Core in the next project period. Major Core services include providing study-design and statistical-analysis support; establishing procedures for data management and database organization to facilitate efficient analyses; assisting DDC investigators in acquiring clinical specimens needed for their research; assisting and training in compliance, patient confidentiality and oversight issues, including preparation of IRB requests and preparation of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications; and training. The Clinical Core fulfills an important need for the DDC investigators at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), where there is no department of epidemiology or biostatistics or a funded Clinical Translational Science Award grant. For the new funding period, Core E will continue to support ongoing and innovative research to prevent and cure digestive diseases. We also propose new DDC member-exclusive services that include cutting edge statistical analyses, enhanced research coordination service, and establishment of a enteroid biorepository. Both Core Co-Directors brings a unique area of expertise in clinical, translational, and epidemiological research, namely sample and tissue collection, epidemiology and health services research, and biostatistics. Advances during the current funding period include the expansion of sample and tissue collection and banking, and the increased number of requests involving epidemiology and health outcomes research, especially those using electronic databases to capture large amounts of patient information, risk factors, therapies, and outcomes; these databases include large disease registries and healthcare claims data. During the current award cycle, the has been critically involved in developing the new service in the newly reorganized GEMS Core of the DDC, providing human organoids to DDC investigators. The Core will continue to support establishment of the enteroid biorepository and expand the specimen collection service to collect tissue from livers. This service is highly sought after and will be shared with researchers studying gastrointestinal injury and inflammation."
"9457440","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The retina, like many other regions of the nervous system, is subject to a variety of inherited and acquired degenerative conditions. These conditions often result in the degeneration of the photoreceptors, the main light sensing cells in the retina. Despite the loss of photoreceptors, the inner retinal circuitry is intact for many year, and this has led to the possibility of photoreceptor replacement as a potential therapy. Cell replacement strategy is important as the loss of photoreceptors in the mammalian retina is not associated with any effective regeneration from resident cells. A potential source of cellular replacement could be pluripotent stem cells. There are a number of groups looking into the potential of stem cell derived RPE including an approved clinical trial for RPE cell replacement for AMD and Stargardt dystrophy. However, as the disease progresses to vision loss, patients will require replacement of the lost photoreceptor cells as well. Although a number of groups have shown integration of photoreceptors in the mouse retina, the overall efficiency is really low. Additionally, the role of the microglia in this process has largely been unexplored. This proposal aims to look at the role of microglia-derived neurotrophic factors in both retinal repair and regenerative medicine. We will use a cross-species approach to identify and carry out basic studies in flies and apply the result in mammalian retinas."

"9491587","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal-dominant systemic connective tissue disorder that affects 1 in 5000 individuals. Patients with MFS typically develop aortic root aneurysms with ensuing aortic dissection or rupture remaining the leading cause of death. Previous studies have demonstrated that the underlying fibrillin-1 gene mutation in MFS increases the activity of transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?). Although TGF-? blockade inhibits aortic root aneurysm development in murine models of MFS, the molecular mechanism by which TGF- ? signaling leads to aneurysm development remains unknown.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding single-stranded RNAs that function to regulate hundreds of genes. Our laboratory has reported that miR-29b plays a key pathogenic role in early aneurysm development in a Marfan mouse model (Fbn1C1039G/+). miR-29b is known to regulate genes involved in apoptosis and ECM deposition/remodeling. Importantly, how TGF-? increases miR-29b expression in a manner that is temporally and spatially restricted to the aortic root during early postnatal life, is not clear.  The aorta is a heterogeneous structure composed of three layers, the intima, media and adventitia. Lineage studies have shown that vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) in the different anatomic segments of the aorta have distinct embryological origins. Recent studies have suggested that the diversity of SMC origin may explain site specific location of aneurysm development. Our laboratory has developed induced-pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from human MFS patients and have successfully differentiated them into SMC from different embryologic origins (second heart field, neural crest cells and paraxial mesoderm). This in vitro model system will allow us to study how SMC origin influences regional differences in aneurysm formation. Complementary experiments will be performed using an in vivo Marfan animal model, thus increasing the translational potential of these studies. The overall working hypothesis that differences in the embryonic origin of smooth muscle cells lead to distinct miR-29b-mediated extracellular matrix remodeling and contributes to aortic root aneurysm formation in Marfan syndrome will be tested by the following two specific aims:  AIM 1: Determine if the miR-29b upstream regulators and downstream targets are different in Marfan human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived vascular SMCs from different embryologic origins.  AIM 2: Contrast the role of miR-29b in the development of aneurysms within aortic segments originating from distinct embryonic origins utilizing the Fbn1C1039G/+ (aortic root; second heart field) and Ang II ApoE (abdominal; mesoderm) mouse models.  This proposal will provide a mechanistic framework explaining aneurysm development in MFS. Investigating the pathways that participate in extracellular matrix (ECM) degeneration in the aortic root specifically might translate into more anatomically directed therapeutics."
"9445396","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Healthy skeletal muscle is essential to sustain normal physical function, and muscle undergoes multiple developmental and functional transitions during fetal, neonatal and adult life. In the latest stages of life, impaired muscle homeostasis and reduced muscle regenerative potential lead to progressive loss of muscle mass and strength. Importantly, reduced muscle function in elderly individuals is one of the strongest predictors of imminent mortality, suggesting that improved understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying muscle aging and the development of novel strategies to intervene in this process, would have tremendous impact on lifespan and quality of life of the growing population of aged individuals experiencing degenerative muscle decline. This project is aimed at increasing our understanding of skeletal muscle function throughout life by focusing on a novel circulating hormone called Growth Differentiation Factor 11 (GDF11, also known as Bone Morphogenic Protein 11, or BMP11). Extensive published and preliminary data indicate that GDF11 plays a key role in modulating the homeostatic remodeling of skeletal muscle fibers and the regenerative activity of muscle stem cells (satellite cells) at particular stages of life. GDF1 protein circulates at high levels in neonatal and young adult animals (including humans), but declines dramatically with advancing age and in concert with the emergence of multiple age-associated pathologies in muscle and other tissues. Data from our recently published manuscripts indicate that raising the levels of circulating GDF11 in aged mice can reverse certain age-related pathologies, including recovery of satellite cell numbers in resting muscle and restoration of muscle regenerative potential after mild muscle injury. However, overproduction of this protein in younger mice subjected to severe muscle damage may have a detrimental effect. In this project, we will answer questions crucial to understanding the regulation and activity of this new candidate rejuvenating factor for aged muscle, and its potential for regulating developmental and aging phenotypes in mice and humans by: (1) defining the cellular source(s) of GDF11 throughout life and clarifying the basis for the age-dependent decline of this hormone and its potential age- and injury-dependent effects on muscle repair, (2) evaluating the impact on development and homeostasis of removal of GDF11 at discrete stages of life or in discrete GDF11- producer cells, and (3) assessing age-regulated changes in GDF11 abundance and function in human sera and correlating these with muscle performance, body composition and overall physical function in individuals with or without mobility limitations. Together, these studies will provide critical insights into muscle developmental biology and aging and may validate a promising new candidate therapeutic for the reversal of age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction."
"9566853","PROJECT SUMMARY  The Clinical Core is located at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine (SPHTM). The overall objective of the Core is to recruit 300 male human subjects (200 Caucasians and 100 African Americans, AA) for Projects 2 & 3 and offer expertise and support for clinical, translational and human study aspects of this P01 application. These human subjects will be selected to fall into top 20% or bottom 20% of the age- and ethnicity-matched population in their hip BMD values and also meet a series of our well established in- /ex-clusion criteria. These in-/ex-clusion criteria have been in use for years in the extensive publications for our geneomics/functional genomics studies of osteoporosis. These human subjects will also all be included in Project 1, for the integrative data analyses within individual projects and across Projects 1-3 in the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core. Recruitment will be performed in Tulane SPHTM at New Orleans.  Recruitment steps include: screen for potential subjects through our ongoing funded large-scale Louisiana Osteoporosis Study (LOS) and through the existing LOS archive; contact potential subjects and schedule visits for those willing to participate; confirm eligibility, perform clinical examination and collect specimens. Currently, LOS contains >6,500 Caucasians and >4,500 AAs in archive, approximately ~40% of which are males. Most of them (>95%) signed consent to allow re-contact for future research opportunities. LOS is currently accumulating, on average, ~180 new Caucasian subjects and ~120 AA subjects each month to the archive.  Steps in specimen collection are: perform phlebotomy to obtain 120 ml peripheral blood from each of the 200 Caucasian and 100 AA subjects; transfer the blood immediately to the Tulane CBG (Center for Bioinformatics and Genomics) wet labs for cell isolation (<5 minute walk from the phlebotomy site).  The PI?s group has had a long history of successful recruitment for clinical and epidemiological studies. We will recruit 75 qualified male subjects (50 Caucasians and 25 AAs) during each of the Years 1-4. The total cohort will include 200 healthy Caucasian and 100 healthy AA males, aged 20-30, half of each ethnic group with high, and the other half with low BMD at the hip (top or bottom 20% in age- and ethnicity-matched population). High and low BMD subjects will be closely matched for age and weight. All the relevant anthropormetric, epidemiological, medical and pehneotypic information, which are standard in our extensive genetic epidemiology studies of osteoporosis, will be collected. The services provided by this Core are routine in our CBG and based on the LOS, have been successful for several of our previous (e.g., R01AR064421, R21AG027110, 2R01AR050496, and 5P50AR055081) and ongoing (e.g., R01 AR057049 and 1R01AR059781) NIH projects. We do not foresee any insurmountable problem."
"9604592","Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular drugs are primarily prescribed to older people (>65 years of age) since the prevalence of chronic heart failure and fibrillation increases with age. The incidence of other diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, increases with age, too. Any medications hold potential risks to cause adverse events. Therefore, the risks of medications in older people also increase with age. While cardiac safety of drugs is one of the primary concerns among drug developers and regulatory agencies, potential new drugs are tested using animal models of normal age. Limited progress has been made in developing a tool to predict potential cardiac safety issues in aging heart, representing a significant unmet need in drug discovery industry. The United States will have 73 million aging population, (>65 years of age) in 2030. The development of a computational model that can predict potential cardiac safety reactions is a plausible step towards preparing the drug discovery industry for a rapidly approaching era of longevity. This Phase I proposal will validate and improve a computational model that incorporate potential age-related changes in regulators of excitation contraction coupling (ECC) of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and contribution of fibroblasts (FBs) that are known to increase their population in aging hearts. The specific Aims are 1) to develop and refine a computational model representing coupled FBs and CMs to simulate electrophysiology and calcium handling of aging human heart tissue, 2) to establish human engineered heart tissues by incorporating aging cardiac FBs and applying environmental stress that known to induce cardiac aging. These Aims are proposed to optimize a computational model, Wisdom Heart (WH) that mimics age-associated changes in cardiac ECC of myocardium with increasing number of FBs. The quality of WH model will be evaluated and improved against experimental data obtained from myocardium models. The established model will be shared with the consortium organized by HESI (hesiglobal.org) with FDA, industry, and academia that is trying to improve cardiac safety issues. The model will be incorporated to our services for conducting contract research projects of cardiac safety assessments and drug discovery for heart failure. We have active contracts with FDA research scientists at the National Center for Toxicological Research."
"9502671","ABSTRACT Ovarian cancer is a silent killer with few early symptoms and advanced disease often present at the time of diagnosis. This cancer is the most lethal of all gynecologic malignancies with over 20,000 new cases diagnosed each year. The 5 year survival rates for ovarian cancer dramatically improve when the disease is diagnosed at an earlier stage. Therefore, the long term goal of the Glycomics Laboratory for the Development of Ovarian Cancer Biomarkers is to apply the most advanced technologies toward the goal of identifying glycoprotein and glycan markers that can detect ovarian cancer early. We are a multidisciplinary team with expertise in cancer biology, glycomics, glycan array analysis, and translational glycoimmunology from investigators at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS), the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (CCRC) at the University of Georgia, and the Harvard Medical School Center for Glycoscience at Harvard University. The investigators at UAMS specialize in biomarker discovery using glycomic methods and functional studies of glycosyltransferase enzymes in ovarian cancer progression, the co-investigators at the CCRC specialize in the mass spectrometry identification of O-linked glycans present on the Notch receptor and the functional analysis of these glycans in Notch activation, and the co-investigators at Harvard specialize in the development of antibodies binding to tumor-specific glycans and the development of glycopeptide arrays. The aims of this application are (1) To develop and validate N-linked and O-linked glycoforms for the detection of ovarian cancer and (2) To discover and develop glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored protein glycoforms and GPI anchor binding proteins for the detection of ovarian cancer."
"9658631","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Fatty acid trafficking in astrocytes: role of mitochondrial morphology and lipid droplet dynamics  As the population of the United States ages, the burden of both dementia and obesity-related disorders is increasing. There is mounting evidence that obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes can contribute to the progression of dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the interplay between metabolism and neurodegeneration. A candidate protein linking metabolism and AD is ApoE. ApoE is involved in the transport of lipids, including fatty acids (FAs) and cholesterol, in the brain. Of all the identified genetic risk factors for developing late onset AD, a particular version of the APOE gene called the APOE4 allele is the strongest predictor of risk. How the ApoE4 protein contributes to the progression of AD is not understood. ApoE is not normally expressed in neurons, but is expressed in astrocytes. Astrocytes are cells in the brain that supply neurons with many metabolic building blocks, including FAs. The proposed study will use advanced microscopy techniques to investigate the storage, metabolism, and trafficking of FAs within astrocytes, and between astrocytes and neurons. In Aim 1, the effect of ApoE on FA storage and metabolism in astrocytes will be examined. The effect of ApoE expression in astrocytes on the transfer of FAs from astrocytes to neurons will also be tested, and the effect of FA transfer from astrocytes to neurons on neuronal health and synaptogenesis will be determined. In Aim 2, the hypothesis that ApoE affects mitochondrial morphology and function will be tested. Mitochondria are the cellular compartment responsible for metabolizing FAs. ApoE has been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction, but the mechanism is unclear. Lastly, in Aim 3 the hypothesis that ApoE affects the interaction between lipid droplets and other cellular compartments will be investigated. Lipid droplets are the cellular compartment responsible for storing fat. Thus, the exchange of FAs between lipid droplets and other cellular compartments responsible for synthesizing and oxidizing FAs is likely to have an impact on FA trafficking within astrocytes, and between astrocytes and neurons. Together, these studies will provide insight into the links between metabolism and neurodegeneration. This could lead to new approaches for early intervention to slow or prevent Alzheimer's disease, for example by targeting metabolic pathways that control the storage or trafficking of FAs in astrocytes. Such interventions have the potential to dramatically improve the quality of life of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and other dementias."
"9459291","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is the leading cause of hospitalizations in older persons, which markedly worsen quality-of-life, increase mortality and health care costs, and have been declared a national priority by CMS.  However, current management strategies have had only modest impact on rehospitalizations for ADHF, and recent trials have been negative, suggesting a need for a new approach.  Multiple lines of evidence suggest that severe impairments in physical function strongly contribute to adverse outcomes in older ADHF patients.  Even when stable and well-compensated, older patients with chronic HF have severe impairments in physical function, which markedly worsen as they transition to ADHF. These are further exacerbated by hospital-related factors, including forced bed rest.  After discharge, patients continue to have marked impairments in strength, balance, mobility, and endurance. Most patients meet formal definitions of frailty, and some never recover baseline function. This occurs during the highest risk period for early rehospitalization and adverse outcomes.  We hypothesize that this cascade of events resulting in persistent, severe physical dysfunction contributes to the high rates of rehospitalization in older HF patients. However, current HF management paradigms do not address the marked impairments in physical function, and neither chronic nor acute HF are approved indications for cardiac rehabilitation.  Furthermore, exercise training trials have excluded ADHF, and have also not included the domains of balance, strength and mobility which are important for preventing injuries in frail, older patients.  To address this critical evidence gap, we developed a novel, tailored, progressive, multidisciplinary 12-week rehabilitation intervention beginning during hospitalization and designed to address the specific deficits in physical function of older ADHF patients.  In our pilot study, this intervention was safe and produced a 17.9% improvement in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score and a 29.3% reduction in all-cause rehospitalizations. The change in the SPPB score explained 90% of the reduction in all-cause rehospitalizations. The primary aim of the proposed study (REHAB-HF) is to  conduct a multi-center, randomized, controlled, single-blind trial in 360 older patients with ADHF to test the  primary specific hypothesis that the REHAB-HF intervention will improve physical function, as  measured by the SPPB. The secondary aim is to collect clinical outcomes data during 6-month follow-up to test the hypothesis that the REHAB-HF intervention group will have a reduced 6-month all-cause  rehospitalization rate.  The investigators are a cohesive, highly experienced multidisciplinary team from three well-established sites. By testing a novel intervention supported by multiple levels of evidence, the REHAB-HF trial will address a critical evidence gap in the care of older patients with ADHF, the most common Medicare discharge diagnosis. The REHAB-HF results could shift clinical management paradigms, improve function, reduce costs, and change health care policy for the 1 million older patients per year with hospitalized ADHF."
"9468524","Project Summary/ Abstract: The goal of this project is to create a tissue engineered vascularized skeletal muscle construct. Volumetric muscle loss (VML) is a muscle defect that impacts greater than 20% of the volume of an individual muscle, overwhelming the natural repair mechanisms and leading to chronic functional deficits in the affected muscle. Current treatment options for VML are limited by donor site morbidity, lack of donor tissue, and the need for a highly skilled surgical team. Developing a tissue engineered vascularized skeletal muscle construct would mitigate these complications and provide a clinically-relevant treatment for VML. An ideal cell source for skeletal muscle tissue engineering, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have high proliferation rates, can directly differentiate into myoblasts, and evade the host immune system. ASCs will be grown on novel electrospun fibrin fibers that mimic the environment of native muscle by providing a muscle-like stiffness and topographic alignment cues to encourage ASC myogenesis in 3D. The fibers provide a number of advantages: they mimic the structure and mechanics of native muscle, are composed of a biological material yet can be manufactured reproducibly, and they integrate well with host tissue causing minimal fibrosis.  The objective of the proposed study is to effectively overcome two major limitations associated with ASC-mediated tissue engineered skeletal muscle and enable functional regeneration of a VML defect. First, the efficiency of ASC differentiation into skeletal myoblasts will be increased. ASCs are a highly heterogeneous population and narrowing ASCs to a potentially pro-myogenic CD34+CD31- subpopulation in a myomimetic 3D microenvironment may result in significantly higher levels of myoblast differentiation, which will be necessary to obtain a contractile muscle graft. Second, a strategy to rapidly vascularize the tissue engineered constructs to maximize post-transplantation cell survival and integration of the engineered graft with the host tissues will be developed. Native skeletal muscle is heavily vascularized and increasing vasculature within muscle defects has been shown to improve muscle regeneration. Vascularized muscle constructs will be developed by bundling ASC-derived skeletal muscle grafts with fibers containing engineered vascular networks comprised of ASCs and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). The development of a vascularized muscle construct is likely to further enhance the in vivo regenerative potential of ASCs and their clinical translatability. In Specific Aim 1 the myogenic capabilities of CD34+CD31- ASC subpopulation versus unsorted ASCs on electrospun fibrin fibers will be compared. In Specific Aim 2 a 3D vascularized fibrin construct will be developed in vitro and its incorporation into host vasculature will be investigated in vivo. In Specific Aim 3 a vascularized muscle construct will be developed in vitro and its ability to enhance in vivo muscle regeneration in a VML defect will be assessed. This work will enable the development of a vascularized skeletal muscle construct with easily procurable cell types and off-the-shelf biomaterials that would provide a clinically-relevant treatment for VML."
"9464356","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis affects 10 million Americans, and associated fragility fractures cause significant morbidity and mortality. While a great deal is known about the molecular pathways controlling osteoblast and osteoclast function, relatively little is known about the most abundant cell type in bone, the osteocyte. Osteocytes produce sclerostin, a potent inhibitor of bone formation by osteoblasts and an osteoporosis drug target. Notably, the only existing osteoporosis therapy that boosts bone formation, parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1-34 (teriparatide), works in part by reducing sclerostin production by osteocytes. The focus of this grant proposal is to elucidate the intracellular mechanisms controlling osteocyte biology, with an emphasis on sclerostin gene regulation and its control by PTH. Class IIa HDACs (Hdac5 and Hdac4) have been identified as important regulators of osteocytic sclerostin production and osteocyte differentiation in general. Aim 1 will fully characterize the effects of class IIa HDAC deficiency on osteocyte biology in vivo using multiple independent and complementary approaches. Aim 2 will interrogate the role of class IIa HDACs in PTH-mediated sclerostin suppression in vivo. Importantly, though some information is known about how class IIa HDACs might control sclerostin expression, much remains unknown. Therefore, Aim 3 will determine novel class IIa HDAC binding proteins and substrates in osteocytes using cutting-edge proteomic approaches. The candidate Dr. Wein is a physician/scientist dedicated to a career in basic investigation in skeletal biology. His education (combined MD/PhD degrees) provides him rigorous training in basic science and human physiology. An endocrinologist subspecializing in metabolic bone diseases, considerable and complementary overlap exists between his clinical and research interests. Beyond the research proposed within, Dr. Wein's career development plan will allow him to maximize the resources within the MGH Endocrine Unit, Harvard Medical School, and the Broad Institute to achieve his career goals. He has identified a mentor, Dr. Henry Kronenberg, who is a worldwide leader in skeletal biology and PTH actions. Dr. Wein and Kronenberg have a plan for frequent meetings to discuss data and career development. Dr. Kronenberg has clearly identified aspects of the research proposed by Dr. Wein which will form the basis of his independent career. Collaborators within the MGH Endocrine Unit and at the Broad institute have been identified, and an advisory committee has been formed to evaluate progress and plan future directions. Dr. Wein will frequently present his data and attend seminars and journal clubs in the MGH Endocrine Division and at the Broad Institute, and will present his findings at international meetings on an annual basis. Formal coursework is planned in grant writing, public speaking, and computational biology to further enhance his probability of success as an independent physician/scientist. Dr. Wein's immediate career goals include acquiring the skills described in this grant proposal in conjunction with his mentor Dr. Kronenberg and collaborators identified within, and publishing first authors manuscripts in order to gain name recognition and to establish himself in the osteocyte field. Dr. Wein's long-term career goal is to establish himself as an independent investigator studying basic cell biology mechanisms controlling bone cell function in vivo. His PhD work with Dr. Laurie Glimcher focused on osteoblast biology, but at this point he needs additional training in skeletal biology and studying osteocytes in vivo and in vitro. Substantial expertise in these areas is present within MGH Endocrine Unit, a collaborative group dedicated to mineral ion metabolism and bone biology, with close attention to relevance to the understanding and treatment of human disease. Aims 1 and 2 of this grant proposal will allow Dr. Wein to gain experience and expertise in the in vivo approaches required to study osteocyte biology. Aim 3 will facilitate the discovery of new genes important for osteocyte function: as an independent investigator, Dr. Wein will then use the skills acquired in this grant proposal to determine the phenotype of novel mutant strains."
"9543595","Despite the emergence of an increased number of molecular targeted agents, the prognosis for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) remains poor with 5 year survival rates of <10%. Agents targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have met with limited success in the clinical treatment of CRC and are limited to treatment of those patients whose tumors do not harbor mutations in KRAS or BRAF. Approximately 10% of colorectal malignancies are known to possess a BRAF valine 600 (BRAFV???) mutation, conferring an extremely poor prognosis. Reactivation of the MAP kinase pathway by EGFR and the co-occurrence of PIK3A mutations or loss of expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN serve to render BRAFmt tumors refractory to MEK or BRAF inhibitor monotherapies. Our central hypothesis is that a dual small molecule inhibitor that potently and selectively targets only EGFR and PI3KA in combination with an inhibitor of MAP kinase signaling represents a viable strategy for the treatment of BRAF mutant colorectal cancers. To test this hypothesis, we have designed small molecules that exhibit potent and selective dual inhibition of EGFR and PIK3A family members. To the best of our knowledge, the lead compound MTX-211 represents a first in class selective inhibitor of these two critical oncogenic kinases. We have generated crystallographic evidence confirming that MTX-211 binds to these two kinases in the manner predicted from its computational design, adopting a flipped binding mode to selectively and potently inhibit both EGFR and PI3K. Preliminary data have shown a striking increase in lifespan of mice implanted with patient-derived BRAFmt CRC when treated with the combination of MTX-211 and the MEK inhibitor trametinib. We now propose to carry out more extensive preclinical testing of MTX-211 in patient derived xenograft models established from patients diagnosed with BRAFmt CRC to bolster the case for this clinical development path. Molecular profiling will be carried out to elucidate markers that correlate with inherent sensitivity as well as the adaptive signaling changes that lead to progression. Additionally, we propose to maximize durability of response by carrying out comparative efficacy studies of MTX-211 combined with clinically approved MEK versus RAF inhibitors to inform the design of future clinical trials of this promising drug candidate for treatment of this recalcitrant disease."
"9556128","ABSTRACT The recent shift in Alzheimer?s disease (AD) clinical research from clinical diagnosis toward the goal of developing neuroprotective therapies has highlighted the need for a robust and rapidly-administered cognitive assessment tool capable of identifying individuals in the earliest stages of cognitive decline and measuring subtle changes in cognitive-motor performance over time. In this context, physical frailty together with cognitive impairment (known as ?cognitive frailty?) is shown to be a strong and independent predictor of cognitive decline over time. The International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics, as well as The International Academy on Nutrition and Aging have recommended the use of cognitive frailty measurement for determining pathways of MCI progression toward dementia/AD, and loss of independence. We have recently developed a novel cognitive frailty measurement tool that is based on a combination of a wearable sensor attached to patient?s shin and virtual reality software. The assessment performed using this platform is the Instrumented Trail Making Task or iTMT . This innovative tool for objective and simultaneous assessment of both motor and cognitive performance is used to examine the ability of the patient to execute a trail-making task in a virtual environment. The assessment is based on measuring the execution time and user performance during multiple tasks that involve visual search, scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, and executive function. In performing each task, motor performance is quantified by measuring ankle velocity and cognitive performance is quantified by assessing motor-planning error, working memory, and time needed to complete the task. In our pilot study, which was recently published in Gerontology, we demonstrated that iTMT can be used to assess cognitive-motor performance and identify aMCI and AD in older adults. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the ability of iTMT to determine frailty status. The iTMT could be used as an alternative test to the dual-task walking test to assess and quantify cognitive frailty in older adults. The unique benefits of the proposed platform include objectivity, low cost, time-savings, multifaceted assessment, and being easy to use. This STTR Phase I study aims to transfer this innovative and patented technology from Baylor College of Medicine to BioSensics LLC for further development, clinical testing, and commercialization. BioSensics is a privately-held biomedical firm specialized in wearable technologies for healthcare, with a proven record of rapidly transitioning governmental research funding into commercialized medical devices and technologies. The iTMT product proposed here will be added to the current line of point-of-care assessment tools commercialized by BioSensics, which includes devices for gait and fall risk (LEGSys), balance (BalanSens) and Frailty (Frailty Meter)."
"9442606","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR Phase II proposal is intended to further develop human ghrelin as a radiation medical countermeasure (MCM) to be approved by the FDA in the future. The risks of nuclear terrorism and nuclear power plant leaks still remain high, both of which can cause acute radiation injury on a large scale. Currently, there are limited drugs available to treat acute radiation syndrome (ARS). Human ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide hormone with broad effects on various body systems, including the endocrine, gastrointestinal (GI), cardiovascular, and immune systems. In our completed SBIR Phase I project, we have exposed rats and mice to total body irradiation (TBI) and demonstrated that subcutaneous administration of human ghrelin for 6 days, starting at 24 h post-TBI, significantly increased their survival rates and reduced their body weight loss. We further demonstrated, in the rat, that treatment with human ghrelin improved intestinal integrity and reduced gut apoptosis and permeability. Human ghrelin can be synthesized in large quantity for mass emergency needs. Moreover, human ghrelin has been tested in several clinical trials for other disease indications with an excellent safety profile. Based on our positive Phase I results, we hypothesize that human ghrelin can be developed as an effective post-exposure mitigator for acute radiation injury. In this proposal, we will use the mouse model of radiation injury to identiy the dose modification factor (DMF) of human ghrelin to treat GI-ARS and hematopoietic ARS (H- ARS). We will also examine human ghrelin's effect to attenuate hematopoietic and GI damages. In addition, we will conduct an exploratory study in non-human primates (NHP) to evaluate the effect of human ghrelin treatment on the GI and hematology response to radiation exposure. These proposed studies should provide crucial information on the efficacy of human ghrelin as a novel radiation MCM primarily targeting GI-ARS. Our ultimate goal is to obtain the FDA approval to use human ghrelin as a safe and effective treatment for people with acute radiation injury after a radiation emergency."
"9465467","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This resubmission is comprised of three applications (Clinical and Data Coordinating Centers (CCC, DCC) and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Core). We propose to conduct a large (N=2100) simple, superiority trial in the US and Canada - BEST - comparing best open surgery to best endovascular revascularization to prevent mortality, limb-amputation or further revascularization in a target limb with critical limb ischemia (CLI), meeting the current mandate for assessing comparative effectiveness. Trial leadership is comprised of a closely integrated and highly experienced group of investigators based at a CCC (Brigham and Women's Hospital, BWH , Boston University Medical Center, BUMC, and Massachusetts Hospital, MGH, Boston, MA), a DCC (New England Research Institutes, Inc., Watertown, MA) and an Executive Committee of experts in the field. The Health Economics Group at BWH will work closely with the DCC to address assessment of quality of life and cost-effectiveness (C-E). The trial will be conducted at approximately 120 sites in the U.S. and Canada, builds upon prior feasibility data and endeavors to address limitations of current research in this area.  Peripheral artery disease prevalence is 15-20% over 70 years, with higher rates in smokers and diabetics. In the subset with CLI, 40% require limb amputation and annual mortality exceeds 20%. With the advent of endovascular techniques for revascularization, we demonstrate from our completed surveys that there is current equipoise among practitioners with respect to best therapy in the majority of CLI cases. The BEST trial will provide, for the first time, urgently needed clinical guidance for CLI management in the context of C-E by using: a pragmatic design, including a range of established techniques; a novel primary endpoint - MALE (major adverse limb event including limb amputation or major re-intervention, bypass graft/graft revision or thrombectomy/thrombolysis) - free survival; multi-disciplinary recruitment of vascular surgeons and interventional cardiologists and radiologists; and an innovative, cost-efficient C-E approach. Additional endpoints include other clinical event rates, functional status and QOL and C-E, all using standard definitions and instruments. 140 eligible centers in North America will be approached to ensure 120 are initiated and 80 sites each recruit 1 subject/month over 27 months accrual. Trial duration is 4.25 yrs - 2.25 yrs accrual and 2.0 yrs minimum follow-up. Two cohorts will be studied: All-Vein (N=1620) and Prosthetic Conduit (N=480). Within each cohort, the trial is stratified on 2 factors (4 strata): tissue loss vs. isolated rest pain and infrainguinl with/without significant infrapopliteal occlusive disease. In the All-Vein cohort, BEST has 85% power to detect an EVT vs. OPEN hazard ratio of 1.25 in the primary endpoint (MALE-free survival) with crossover rates accounted for, as well as 2% loss to follow-up. In the Prosthetic Conduit cohort, there is 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.70 for the primary endpoint. This resubmission fully addresses all prior reviewer concerns, to successfully and efficiently execute a trial that will provide important information for the CLI community."
"9461408","The rise in obesity has led to increased prevalence of metabolic disease including diabetes, fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and others. Veterans suffer from these diseases at a disproportional rate relative to the general population. Additionally, obesity and diabetes are strongly linked with post-traumatic stress disorder, which, based on recent research is now actually considered predictive of diabetes. Scientists now posture that obesity per se is not deleterious to health, but it is the dysfunction of adipose tissue that leads to disease. Healthy adipose tissue stores and releases energy appropriately, and secretes endocrine factors that communicate with peripheral organs and tissues to regulate metabolism. However, unhealthy adipose tissue has limited capacity for lipid storage, and is often stretched to that limit, when it becomes inflamed, leading to disruption of many important processes. What determines whether adipose tissue is ?healthy? or ?unhealthy?? It has become increasingly evident that increased adipocyte size is linked with diabetes. Adipocyte size is also inversely proportional to the hyperplastic potential of adipose tissue. That is, when new adipocytes can be made via cell hyperplasia, adipocyte size stays normal; when a limit to hyperplasia occurs, adipocyte size swells to handle the lipid load. Therefore, we might conclude that ability to proliferate adipocytes is key to metabolic health.  Adipocytes arise from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), pluripotent cells that can also become muscle, bone cartilage, and other tissue types. How do these cells ?decide? which differentiation pathway to follow? While some pathways that regulate adipocyte differentiation (or adipogenesis) are known, the factors that regulate these pathways and thus determine cell fate are poorly understood. We have identified a potentially novel adipogenic signal, namely, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). This molecule signals through g protein- coupled receptors to elicit a variety of cell outcomes. There are also receptor-independent functions for sphingosine-1-phosphate. Because our previous work led us to hypothesize that this molecule and therefore the enzyme that synthesizes it, Sphingosine Kinase 1 (SK1), may have a role in adipocytes, we made a mature adipocyte-specific SK1-deletion mouse. We found that these animals have a basal phenotype much like metabolic syndrome, but they are not obese. Specifically, they are insulin resistant, have high circulating levels of leptin and insulin, and show signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Further investigation revealed upregulation of osteo- and chondrogenic pathways and signaling in adipose tissue of these animals, which supports that they exhibit a defect in adipogenesis. We hypothesize that sphingosine-1-phosphate, intracellularly or in the extracellular milieu, participates in creating the adipose tissue microenvironment to promote adipogenesis in adipogenic precursors deriving from MSCs. In this proposal we present data supporting that SK1 and S1P downregulate anti-adipogenic signaling pathways, and that this is required for metabolic health. These studies will not only shed light on how to keep adipose tissue ?healthy? and therefore protect against metabolic disease, but the ?flip side of the coin? is that we will also discover new mechanisms regulating osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. Stimulating these pathways in adipose-derived stem cells is currently a major focus for regenerative medicine. We request funding for these studies from the VA, as both diabetes and tissue repair are of great concern for the veteran population and thus this work is highly relevant to veterans? health."

The overall goal is to grow the pipeline of candidates for careers in CER/PCOR by offering formative research opportunities to early stage trainees. The TL1 specific aims are to:  1) Draw from pools of pre-doctoral students in MD and PharmD programs across the CCTS Partner  Network each year to identify and recruit 20 of the most promising and diverse students for two  components of a CER/PCOR focused TL1 program: A) A year-long research intensive immersion  experience for 10 students/year; and B) An introductory 8-week summer program for 10 students/year;  2) Provide multidisciplinary didactic curricula for these programs to ensure that TL1 Trainees have  foundational knowledge and experience that will prepare them to advance in their careers. In the  year-long program, trainees will choose a clinical research-focused master?s program (i.e., MSPH, MS) at  either UAB or Tulane. These programs will share common didactic activities and other joint activities  presented via videoconference to promote training in CER/PCOR. The 8-week program will occur between  the first and second year of a trainee?s clinical program, while the year-long program will be a ?year out?  from the trainee?s clinical education program, to permit obtaining the MSPH/MS degree and performing  mentored research prior to graduating from their clinical program;  3) Provide and evaluate program and long-term career development support via individual and  team-based mentoring that will promote the acquisition of methodological skills and other core  competencies required for success as independent investigators. Our novel program?s research and  training base is drawn from across 7 Schools at the CCTS Hub and at Tulane, including 35 Primary mentors and 25 Associate mentors. Through this unique combination of an introductory summer program and a year-long intensive program, the TL1 will introduce the CER/PCOR investigator pipeline into the pre-clinical period growing the pool of future CTR investigators."
"9523851","Project Summary Minimal improvement in the 12-15 month average survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has been achieved despite decades of advances in neurosurgery and radiation therapy, many clinical trials for novel therapeutics, and increased understanding of the driving molecular mechanisms. A central issue that confounds successful treatment is the heterogeneous nature of this aggressive tumor. This heterogeneity presents phenotypically as mixed cytological subtypes, genotypically as mutations and gene amplifications, and transcriptionally as regional differences in gene expression. As a result, multiple and spatially distinct heterotypic populations exist within a single GBM, making any lesion- or pathway-specific therapy less effective. While considerable effort has been placed on understanding cell intrinsic mechanisms conferring therapeutic resistance, much less is known about the interactions between heterogeneous tumor cells within these neoplasms that contribute to the recalcitrant nature of this cancer. In GBM, amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor, a hallmark mutation present in 60% of cases, often occurs in a heterogeneous manner and is frequently associated with structural alterations. The most common of these alterations, EGFRvIII, (also known as ?EGFR) results in a constitutively active mutant receptor with tumor enhancing capability. This ability is lacking from amplified wtEGFR despite its more pervasive tumor expression. By modeling this type of genetic heterogeneity in vivo, we have determined that an IL-6 paracrine signaling mechanism driven by EGFRvIII activity can not only recruit wtEGFR-expressing cells into accelerated proliferation, but also promote EGFR-targeted therapeutic resistance through activation of a pro-survival inflammatory NF-?B/BRD4 signaling axis. Given the central role of NF-?B/BRD4 in the remodeling of chromatin super enhancers we postulate that EGFRvIII/wtEGFR sub-population interactions not only enhance aggressive tumor growth, but also prompt the synchronization of aspects of gene expression in these heterotypic cells through shared enhancer remodeling. The overall goal of this renewal project is to dissect and target the mechanisms whereby GBM EGFR/EGFRvIII heterogeneity drives therapeutic resistance through orchestration of NF-?B/BRD4-mediated remodeling of the epigenetic landscape. The following lines of experimentation will be carried out: 1) genome editing to create a drug-selective BRD4 allele for mechanistic chemical biology studies; 2) use of this modified BRD4 allele as a tool for chromatin structure and functional analysis of the cytokine-stimulated NF-?B/BRD4 enhancer landscape in heterotypic and subpopulation-ablated gliomas; 3) genetic and pharmacological inhibition of identified NF-?B/BRD4-mediated genetic or epigenetic vulnerabilities shared among EGFR and EGFRvIII heterotypic cells to enhance therapeutic efficacy."
"9455795","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is a competitive renewal of a grant that we have had since 2001. Work supported by this grant has demonstrated that stress can act via a variety of mechanisms to elevate the function of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Elevated CREB function in the NAc produces depressive- and anxiety-like effects that are due, at least in part, to CREB-regulated increases in expression of dynorphin (DYN), an opioid peptide that acts at kappa-opioid receptors (KORs). Identifying this mechanism led directly to findings that KOR antagonists have antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects in preclinical screening assays that identify standard medications from these drug classes. This combined antidepressant/anxiolytic profile is unique and not shared by any existing medications, and has piqued interest in the development of these drugs for depressive disorders. As KOR antagonists move toward clinical studies, important questions about their mechanisms of action have emerged. In addition, superimposed on growing enthusiasm for KORs as a therapeutic target is increasing skepticism regarding the usefulness of preclinical (laboratory animal-based) screening assays in drug development. Current experiments will broaden our understanding of how CREB and KOR function affect behavior while focusing on domains (hypervigilance, sleep, and decision-making) in rodents that are objective, cut across numerous types of psychiatric illness, and can be studied in humans using endpoints that are virtually (or precisely) identical. We will characterize the neural circuits that regulate these domains and the mechanisms by which the regulation occurs, which may facilitate validation of endpoints that have better predictive value for clinical studies. Our research utilizes cutting-edge molecular tools, engineered mice, pharmacology, and behavioral assays in male and female rodents to accomplish numerous goals. In Aim 1, we will continue to characterize the circuits in which KORs are critical for stress responses, and explore the possibility that KOR antagonists have off-target (non KOR-related) actions that contribute to their putative therapeutic effects. In Aim 2, we will examine the roles of CREB and KORs in stress effects on sleep and circadian rhythms, disruptions in which are a core feature of myriad psychiatric disorders. In Aim 3, we will examine how stress affects interactions between DYN and orexin (ORX), following up on our discovery that these peptides act in tandem despite opposing effects on neural function and behavior. In Aim 4, we will characterize the roles of KORs and ORX receptors (ORXRs) in a complex cognitive impairment (post-error decision-making) that is a core feature of depressive illness and readily apparent in laboratory animals (rats) given treatments that cause depressive-like behaviors. Collectively, this work is designed to hasten the development of improved treatments for psychiatric illness while at the same time being responsive NIMH priorities with respect to (1) studying behavioral dimensions that cut across numerous disorders and (2) considering sex differences as a biological variable."
"9457291","?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall In four scientific projects and four cores, we propose to study Aß PrP, and tau prions causing neurodegeneration. The discovery that prions cause Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases including frontotemporal dementias, Parkinson's disease, and ALS opens new research strategies for deciphering the pathogenesis of these illnesses and developing novel therapeutic approaches. Fundamental to understanding all prions is defining the structural transition that a particular protein undergoes when it becomes a prion. In this P01 renewal application, we plan to exploit new data published by us and others contending that Aß and tau, like PrP, can acquire conformations that are self-propagating; thus, they are prions. In each case, these alternative conformations are enriched for ß-sheet structure and readily polymerize in amyloid fibrils that often condense into plaques r tangles. In Project 1, we propose to study the properties of strains of Aß prions using bigenic mice that we created, to develop cultured cell bioassays that can detect Aß and tau prions, to investigate human (Hu) PrP prions using bigenic mice expressing bank vole (BV) PrP or chimeric Hu/BVPrP transgenes, and to determine if cultured cells expressing BVPrP can support the replication of human prion strains. In Project 2, we propose to continue structural studies of PrPSc formed from recombinant PrP utilizing an 89-mer fragment that initiated replication of anchorless PrPSc prions, to continue structural studies of  Aß with emphasis on naturally occurring mutants, and to initiate structural studies of tau prions. In Project 3, we propose to determine the structure of Aß prions by solution and solid-state NMR; to monitor Aß assembly using multiple probes that are sensitive to both global and local conformations; to create thioamide- containing peptides and foldamers that enhance or inhibit individual steps of amyloid initiation, elongation, and fragmentation; and to synthesize a series of crosslinking reagents to probe the distribution of distances between Lys and Arg residues in Aß, PrP and tau prions. In Project 4, we propose to adapt and apply integrative structural modeling to protein self-assembly, thus facilitating simultaneous modeling of multiple structural states based on sparse, noisy, ambiguous and incoherent data of different kinds."
"9513302","Hormone therapies like oral contraception (OC) confer a heightened risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in premenopausal women. Until we gain mechanistic insights into why this happens, it is not possible to predict who is at risk for sex hormone-induced VTE. The long-term goal of this research is to identify the mechanisms by which sex hormones modulate hemostasis and thrombosis. The overall objective in this application is to determine how OC alter platelet function using a systems biology approach that combines ?omics technologies with computational models. Previous work on hormone-induced VTE have implicated several mechanisms related to platelet function including response to agonists, metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA), and gene expression. Systematic studies of these processes over different time scales and how they relate to each other is lacking and will be addressed here. The central hypothesis is that OC increase platelet reactivity over three time scales; (i) acutely (seconds-minutes) by potentiating calcium release from intracellular stores, (ii) metabolically (minutes-hours) by elevating thromboxane metabolism, and (iii) genomically (days-months) by altering the expression of adhesive receptors. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data that platelets incubated with physiologic concentrations of 17?-estradiol have higher intracellular calcium concentrations following adhesion to collagen and altered central metabolism. The rationale for the proposed research two- fold: (i) the development of new tools to study hormone-induced VTE over multiple time scales, and (ii) to measure the effects of exogenous hormones on platelet function over these time scales. This hypothesis will be tested by two specific aims: 1) Development of systems biology tools. 2) Measuring the effects of OC on platelet function over diverse time scales. Under the first aim, computational models of calcium dynamics and metabolism in platelets will be developed informed by experiments of platelet adhesion and metabolic flux analysis. Additionally, we will perform sequencing of gene variants known to affect platelet function and hormone receptors. Finally, existing microfluidic models of vascular injury will be refined to incorporate endothelial cells to measure platelet-endothelium interactions. Under the second aim, we will use the tools developed in the first aim to measure changes in platelet function following acute and chronic exposure to exogenous hormones. These studies will include tracking platelet function in a cohort of women prior to and after starting OC. The approach is innovative because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by using a systems biology approach to measure and model the influence of sex hormones on platelet function over time scales of seconds to years. The proposed research is significant, because it will identify the mechanism(s) by which exogenous sex hormone confer a pro- and/or antiplatelet phenotype in premenopausal women by both non-genomic and genomic pathways. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to improve the safety of hormone therapies in the United States."
"9456797","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A recent convergence of findings in humans and animals indicates that our capacity for episodic memory relies on a system of cortical areas and the hippocampus that encode events in the context in which they occur. To understand the information processing mechanisms that underlie episodic memory, we are pursuing a systems analysis that will compare the nature of information processing and identify functional interactions between cortical and hippocampal areas. In this phase of funding we will focus on the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), testing the hypothesis that this area is a critical convergenc site for object and context representation: (1) We will distinguish LEC neural activity with regard to object and context processing and examine whether the nature of this processing has a functional topography. (2) We will characterize interactions between the LEC and interconnected cortical and hippocampal areas, testing the hypothesis that functional interactions develop during the course of learning. (3) We will test whether object and context processing in LEC depend on specific inputs from interconnected cortical and hippocampal areas. Our approach combines a behavioral paradigm for associating events and context, multi-site recording that allows us to identify single neuron and ensemble representation and synchronized activity in multiple areas, and multiple methods of reversible inactivation that identify key interactions between areas. The combined information gained from this systems analysis will improve our model of the functional organization of the cortical-hippocampal system and increase our understanding of how episodic memories are stored and retrieved within this system."
"9491637","Cancer Control and Population Sciences Program ABSTRACT The mission of the Cancer Control and Population Sciences (CCPS) Program is to advance the science and application of cancer etiology, prevention, and outcomes research. The goal is to reduce the burden of cancer and its sequelae across all segments of the population through collaborative, multidisciplinary efforts. To achieve this goal, the Program has three themes: 1) To discover host and environmental factors contributing to cancer; 2) To identify factors to reduce health-related morbidity and mortality from cancer treatment; and 3) To develop, implement and evaluate interventions to reduce cancer-related morbidity/mortality and improve quality of life (QOL). Within each of these themes, research is on-going to reduce health disparities within our catchment area. As importantly, each theme encompasses strong education components ranging from K-12 programs in the community to healthcare provider and caregiver training for better communication and care for cancer survivors. Targeted recruits with national prominence add both depth and breadth to the Program and include Drs. Seewaldt, Chlebowski, Gray, Kittles, and Yee. The CCPS Program is particularly invested in the following key areas: building a robust portfolio of research in cancer etiology and biomarker development; strengthening the focus on understanding risk factors for treatment-related complications and developing tailored interventions to reduce morbidity in cancer survivors; recognizing causes of disparities in outcome unique to disease type and developing tailored interventions to systematically mitigate the disparities; and continuing to build upon the strong portfolio of research in psychosocial outcomes and tailored interventions to improve QOL. Sponsored activities include monthly work in progress meetings, monthly seminars, an annual retreat, and annual pilot funding.

"9473818","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is continuing need for improved strategies to prevent the spread of HIV, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). Over half of those living with HIV in the US are MSM and MSM continue to account for two-thirds of new HIV infections. Personalized Cognitive Counseling (PCC) is a brief, effective HIV risk reduction intervention for MSM. PCC has been designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a ?Best-Evidence Intervention,? and the CDC actively disseminates PCC using training materials developed by the applicant company (Allen/Loeb Associates) and the developer of PCC (Dr. James Dilley). Empirical data show that training is not sufficient for implementation of evidence-based HIV prevention interventions in real-world settings. Post-training support is essential, yet no affordable support strategies are available. To meet this need, the developers of the PCC intervention and training developed and tested two strategies for scalable, low-cost, web-based post-training support with Phase I SBIR funding from NIMH (?Web-Based Support For Implementation of Evidence-Based HIV Prevention (PCC),? R43MH099917). Phase I usability tests showed that both strategies--person-to-person consultation (P2P) and video support--are highly acceptable to counselors and are associated with increases in counselor self-efficacy related to PCC delivery. This Phase II project builds on Phase I findings to rigorously test web-based post-training support for PCC. Seventy-five counselors who have recently completed PCC training will be randomized to one of three levels of increasingly intensive post-training support: (1) Information, (2) Video Support & Information, and (3) P2P & Video Support and Information. The impact of post-training support on PCC self-efficacy, knowledge, and implementation will be assessed at study entry, 6 weeks after study entry and 3 months later. We hypothesize that (1) the impact of Video Support & Information will be greater than the impact of Information alone and (2) the impact of P2P & Video Support & Information will be greater than both other conditions. Results of these hypothesis tests will inform the optimal configuration of post-training support for commercialization. The Phase II study will yield a fully functional, market-ready support platform. The primary target market for the platform is Capacity Building Assistance (CBA) providers that are funded by the CDC to provide technical assistance to the CBOs, health departments, and hospitals that deliver evidence-based HIV prevention interventions. Throughout the study period, existing relationships with the CDC and CBA providers will be further developed to insure that the post-training support platform meets customer needs. The web-based support strategies developed for PCC can be generalized to other evidence-based prevention interventions."

Progress made on these aims has provided revolutionary insight into the molecular architecture of mitochondrial energy metabolism and positions us to leverage this knowledge for the development of novel therapies for long chain fatty acid oxidation disorders. The overall goal of this renewal application is to use integrative biology to characterize the molecular architecture of mitochondrial energy metabolism and to understand the global metabolic defects induced by deficiency of single enzyme disorders. Specific Aim 1 is to identify the key protein interactions that stabilize the macromolecular mitochondrial energy complex. I will examine the interactions of three specific sets of proteins based on my previous findings Specific Aim 1a is to use proteomics techniques to examine amino acid residues critical to the formation and stability of the proteins of long chain FAO. Specific Aim 1b is to directly examine the three dimensional structure of the multifunctional energy complex. Specific Aim 2 is to examine the effects of mutations in long chain FAO proteins on the macromolecular mitochondrial energy complex. I hypothesize that some mutations will not only inactivate the mutated protein, but also disrupt the stability and function of the macromolecular mitochondrial energy complex Specific Aim 2a is to examine the effects of patient and CRISPR/Cas9 induced mutations in cell lines and an FAOD mouse model on interaction of the long chain FAO complex core proteins with their binding partners.. Specific Aim 2b is to examine the effects of mutations in ETFDH on its interaction with complex III. Specific Specific Aim 2c is to characterize new mutations in patients with FAODs. Aim 3 is to develop novel small molecule compounds to treat long chain FAODs. I have previously used molecular modeling and an in vitro cell system to identify potential therapeutic small molecule chaperonins and peptides that stabilizes the common Glu304Lys mutant MCAD protein, one of which is currently in clinical trials in patients. My collaborators and I have also shown that some ACAD9 mutations are stabilized by supplementation with excess riboflavin, similar to a finding with some ETFDH mutations. I hypothesize that additional therapeutic molecules have the potential to stabilize other mutant fatty acid oxidation proteins and mitigate the atypical inflammatory process seen in VLCAD deficiency. Specific Aim 3a is to examine the use of novel pharmaceutical agents known to affect energy metabolism and inflammation in cells from patients with FAODs. Specific Aim 3b is to examine the effect of these compounds in mouse models of FAODs in order to prepare for possible clinical trials in patients."
"9526697","Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability and creates a societal burden of $34 billion each year in the United States alone. While new endovascular treatments have shown promise to improve stroke outcomes and recovery, they have been hampered by the lack of noninvasive biomarkers to identify patients who are good candidates for these therapies. In particular, imaging of brain oxygenation is a long-recognized but unmet need in the stroke community, and we propose to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to address this need.  This project develops a clinically feasible toolset to noninvasively image brain tissue oxygenation by magnetic resonance imaging. Our specific aims are (1) to develop new MRI techniques, quantitative BOLD and vascular fingerprinting, that utilize a novel pulse sequence to quantify oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) levels in cerebral tissues; (2) to validate MR OEF imaging with simultaneous [15O] positron emission tomography (PET) reference images in patients with cerebrovascular disease; and (3) to apply MRI OEF methods to study oxygenation status in patients with carotid artery stenosis who are at high risk of stroke.  The innovation of this work lies in the development of a novel imaging technique to assess quantitative OEF in brain tissues. The use of a hybrid PET/MRI system to validate the new OEF imaging methods with simultaneous measurements by [15O] PET is also highly novel. The outcome of proposal is a validated MRI tool to image OEF, and quantitative MRI observations of OEF in patients with carotid artery stenosis, and its relationship to patient symptoms and perfusion status. The significance of this work is a clinically feasible MRI protocol to image tissue OEF that is transferrable to any clinical site. The reproducible and robust tool will allow the stroke imaging community to better stratify patients for new treatments, and implement multi-center trials to evaluate endovascular interventions to reduce stroke risk in these populations."
"9494774","Project Summary  Risk prediction is inherent to all clinical practice and public health and has been a topic of scientific research for decades. Formal prediction models are frequently used to enhance clinicians' and researchers' ability to quantify and communicate risk. However, a prediction model is only useful if it is accurate when applied outside of the population within which it was developed. Unfortunately, many prediction models in use today prove inaccurate when applied over time and to new populations, yielding not only inaccurate predictions but also a false level of confidence about the quality of their risk assessments. This commonly occurs because models are applied to patients with different clinical characteristics and risk of disease, to medical practices that differ from those used to develop the model, and to methods of care that constantly change over time. The current scientific paradigm does not readily allow models to accommodate these differences. As a result, model accuracy is often compromised for years of clinical use, new models are slow to be developed (if at all), and these new models are no better able to account for changing patient populations or medical practice than the original models.  A potential solution to these problems is `Dynamic Prediction Modeling.' Rather than using existing models in practice without accommodating their inevitable degradation in performance and, at best, infrequently developing new models with the same limitations, dynamic prediction modeling updates an existing prediction model continually as new data are accrued. In this approach, the updated models combine the information that is captured in the original model with data from new patients to produce an updated model for future predictions. As a result of this ongoing model-refinement process, dynamic prediction models have the potential to enhance and maintain model accuracy in the presence of changing patient populations and medical practices over time.  Our objective in this proposal is to develop and test this new paradigm for risk prediction through rigorous statistical and applied research, to provide comprehensive guidance for the real-world use of dynamic prediction modeling, and thus to remove critical barriers to the wider dissemination of these methods in clinical research and practice. Specifically, this project will: (1) use formal and comprehensive simulations to develop guidelines for implementing dynamic model recalibration, revision, and extension; (2) test and compare these dynamic prediction modeling approaches with the traditional approach to prediction modeling in two real world and diverse clinical settings, and then refine the methods to enhance accuracy and generalizability; and (3) formally and prospectively test the implementation of dynamic prediction modeling in a large, multicenter population of intensive care unit patients to demonstrate the utility, feasibility, and accuracy of dynamic prediction modeling methods in a real-world setting. The ultimate goal is to enhance the generalizability and usefulness of prediction models and improve our ability to deliver precision care."
"9661645","Project Summary/Abstract A key goal of the UCI MODEL-AD Disease Model Development and Phenotyping Project (DMDPP) is to generate and phenotype new models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that better recapitulate late onset AD (LOAD). Cognitive impairments characterize Alzheimer's disease, and are recapitulated in existing mouse models of the disease. Meaningful treatments for Alzheimer's disease will have to address these cognitive impairments, and thus it is imperative to characterize cognition and behavior in newly generated models of the disease. This will provide disease relevance and also to uncover any unexpected phenotypes that may arise as a consequence of disease modeling, and will complement the electrophysiology, gene expression, and pathological data that are collected from each of the mouse models. Additionally, this will allow for harmonization between the other MODEL-AD centers, which are conducting similar behavioral and cognitive testing of the models. To include behavioral and cognitive testing into our existing phenotyping protocol we are requesting funds to purchase a Noldus Ethovision XT Tracking System + chambers. !"
"9520128","The Berkeley Superfund Research Center, in consultation with the Program?s key stakeholders, has identified  four complex problems associated with hazardous waste sites that have proven intractable to current methods.  These problems are how to better assess: 1) cumulative impacts from multiple environmental stressors (e.g.  chemical exposures, stress and obesity); 2) past exposures, especially early-life exposures and their  contribution to risk; 3) the effects of chemical mixtures and their impact on remediation efforts; and, 4) the  complex transformation of chemicals to reactive intermediates and their ability to act through multiple  mechanistic pathways. Here we propose six interactive projects (4 biomedical and 2 engineering) and 5 cores  that aim to address these four problems though original research, translation to appropriate end-users and  community engagement efforts. We will focus on exposures to high priority chemicals commonly found at  Superfund sites, including arsenic, benzene, trichloroethene, formaldehyde, chromium and polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons to address the specific mandates of the Program. We will, however, take a novel approach in  adopting the so-called ?exposome paradigm? in our research. This new paradigm, which we helped develop,  allows for a ?seeing the whole picture? approach to risk assessment, hazard identification and the safe and  effective remediation of hazardous sites containing multiple chemicals. In the exposome paradigm all nongenetic  environmental stressors are considered as environmental exposures. Therefore, cumulative risk  assessment, where the impact of all stressors on a population is assessed, could be operationalized by  exposomics. Communities living near sites face cumulative risks from a variety of environmental and social  factors. The theme of our Center is therefore the exposome and we propose a step-wise approach to applying  exposomics to help solve the complex problems found at Superfund sites. Biomedical Projects 1-4 aim to  develop advanced techniques for the detection, assessment, and evaluation of the effects and risk to human  health of hazardous substances; Engineering Project 5 will develop methods to detect new hazardous  substances in the environment and together with Engineering Project 6 will develop methods to reduce the  amount and toxicity of hazardous substances. A Community Engagement Core C (CEC) will address  contaminated drinking water problems in California in collaboration with Projects 1, 5 and 6 and Core E, a Data  Science and Laboratory Core that will assist researchers and the CEC in meeting their goals. A Research  Translation Core C will facilitate interactions between investigators and key stakeholders and a Training Core  D will develop the next generation of multidisciplinary professionals. The overall goal is to enhance  understanding of the relationship between exposure and disease; provide usable tools to improve human  health risk assessments; and, develop a range of prevention and remediation strategies to protect public health  and the environment. The program will be overseen and coordinated by an Administration Core A."
"9504549","This project addresses a critical clinical need for the VA. Knee pain due to progressive joint degeneration and eventual osteoarthritis (OA) are leading causes of disability, particularly in Veterans who are affected by OA at greater frequency and younger ages than the general population. Knee osteoarthritis is a progressive disease for which current treatment is palliative until complete joint destruction occurs and prosthetic knee replacement is performed. Cortisone injections have been widely used for more than 60 years to treat pain and swelling, but have also shown detrimental effects to articular cartilage. This introduces high clinical need for an injection therapy to improve joint pain and function while preserving cartilage health, especially in those with early disease where there is substantial remaining articular cartilage. Recently, intra-articular autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections have gained traction as a promising new treatment for knee OA that can not only provide symptomatic relief but also potentially contribute growth factors to stimulate endogenous joint repair processes. However, the mechanisms of action of PRP are unknown as are the clinical outcomes in Veterans. Our preliminary data also shows substantial variability between individuals in the biological composition of autologous PRP. In this era of personalized and precision medicine, we propose to examine the outcomes of PRP treatment, and whether individual differences in PRP composition correlate with objective metrics of changes to ambulatory function and cartilage matrix structure following PRP injection treatment for early knee OA in Veterans. Achieving the Aims of this proposal will determine whether intra-articular injection of autologous platelet enriched plasma to treat early knee OA in Veterans and additional women, given within the actual clinical setting, results in positive treatment effects. The information gained will also fill critical knowledge gaps by elucidating potential mechanisms of action for PRP injections in the treatment of symptomatic early knee OA and combining objective scientific assessment (gait analysis and MRI) with standard patient-reported outcomes (PRO). Finally, the new knowledge gained will improve clinical care by informing on factors important to optimal patient selection for this new treatment."
"9499038","Project Summary The need for reliable and effective cardiopulmonary support devices for young children with lung or heart failure is well established. For those pediatric patients who become refractory to conventional therapies, aggressive mechanical circulatory intervention through extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or ventricular assist devices (VADs), may improve the likelihood of survival. ECMO systems are attractive since they closely simulate physiological gas exchange and circulatory support; but in practice, these systems are limited by their operational complexity, mechanical failure, clots in circuit, and bleeding complications. Systems for pediatric ECMO have not changed substantially in the last decade. Improved outcomes in support of children with either heart or lung failure have been principally due to better selection and management of the patients. A newly designed ECMO system is required for continued reduction in the morbidity and mortality. We propose to contribute a new generation ECMO system based on advanced bioengineering principles focused on an optimized blood flow path and pediatric ICU-enhanced patient mobility with biochemical coatings to reduce platelet adherence. We in partnership with industry partners have developed a series of miniature, integrated pump-oxygenators for both young children and adults. These devices combine uniquely configured hollow fiber membranes with novel blood pump technology, resulting in ultra-compact systems with a low priming volume and improved biocompatibility. The pediatric model, called Pedi Pump-Lung (PediPL), is specifically designed for use for up to 30 days in patients weighing 5-25 kg who 1) are not sufficiently stable to be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass after surgery; 2) have severe primary respiratory failure or secondary failure associated with cardiac disease; and 3) experience profound cardiogenic shock and require urgent support. The objectives of this project are to refine and complete development of the PediPL and associated accessories into an ECMO support system permitting ambulatory respiratory and cardiopulmonary support and to conduct pre-clinical evaluation of readiness for manufacturing of the clinical grade PediPL and pre-clinical testing in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) in anticipation of anticipation of 510 K clearance and an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval from FDA."
"9462624","Project 3 seeks to determine whether gene modification of transplanted CD34+ hemotopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to resist HIV infection combined with gene modification of transplanted CD8+ T cells can function coordinately to block viral rebound following sessation of ART and effectively eradicate HIV reservoirs. Specifically, we will leverage the expertise of Project 2 (novel HSC engraftment conditioning regimens) and Projects 1 and 4 (powerful gene-editing approaches including CRISPR/Cas9) to efficiently modify and engraft HSCs and autologous CD8+ T cells within an HSC transplant approach. We will test these concepts in vivo utilizing the recently developed CD34+ HSC-derived humanized BLT mouse model that recapitulates HIV infection and human immunity to HIV to accomplish the two stages of a `Defend and Destroy? HIV cure strategy: i) defend transplanted cells against future HIV infection by knocking out the HIV co-receptor CCR5 in CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs); and ii) enhance the capacity of autologous, mature CD8+ T cells to find and destroy residual HIV infected cells by manipulating genes associated with effector function, mucosal and reservoir homing, and target cell recognition. We hypothesize that the combined approach of limiting viral spread while simultaneously enhancing immune clearance by autologous CD8+ T cell responses has the potential to achieve a functional cure of HIV infection."
"9462165","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past couple of decades, a surge of discoveries have revealed RNA regulation as a central player in cellular processes. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), formed when the two ends of linear transcripts are joined together, were recently identified as a large class of post-transcriptional regulators that perform a range of functions in biological systems. RNAs are regulated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) at all post- transcriptional stages, including splicing, transportation, stabilization and translation. Identifyng the functional targets (including both linear and circular RNAs) of these RBPs ranks among the key biomedical research questions and opens a new direction for drug discoveries. Moreover, investigating RBP-RNA binding is now possible on a genome-wide scale, due to the advent of a technique that couples cross-linking immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq).  The overall goal of this study is to develop novel analytical models and a comprehensive research platform to study RBPs and, more broadly, RNA regulation. A rapidly-expanding amount of CLIP-seq data together with function data, which measure the genome-wide functional changes caused by the binding of a specific RBP, has triggered a critical need for computational methods to systematically analyze the functional targets of RBPs. For this purpose we have already collected extensive CLIP-seq data as well as RNA-seq data, which represent the functional changes caused by RBP-binding. Integrating these large-scale and complementary data sets from different sources will unlock a great opportunity to identify the functional targets of RBPs and to examine the direct interactions between RBPs and circRNAs. More importantly, the findings from our computational analysis will be experimentally validated by our collaborators.  In Aim 1.1 of this study, we will propose a novel statistical approach to improve the analysis of CLIP- seq data and the identification of RBP-binding sites. We will compare and evaluate these new computational approaches by using benchmark datasets from the public domain, as well as by generating our own experimental data with experimental validations. In Aim 1.2 of this study, we will develop a powerful computational model to identify the functional targets of RBPs by integrating RNA sequence, secondary structure, RBP-binding and functional data sets. Promising functional targets will be experimentally validated by our collaborators.  Circular RNA (circRNA) may bind and sequester RBPs into regulatory roles, and studying RBP- circRNA interactions may provide insights into the role of circRNAs in disease pathogenesis and their potential as therapeutic targets. However, as of yet no computational method has been developed to study RBP- circRNA interactions. In Aim 2, we will propose a novel computational method to systematically study RBP- circRNA interactions and their functions using CLIP-Seq data and RNA-seq data.  In Aim 3 of this study, we will develop a publicly-available, comprehensive RBP-RNA interaction web portal with a user-friendly interface and a powerful analysis engine. This web-portal will include all the results, computational algorithms and datasets used in this study. We will integrate these datasets in the web portal together with analytic algorithms developed from this study, so that researchers worldwide can utilize the data and computational tools we have generated. In partnership with the Galaxy team, we plan to develop a user- friendly and reproducible research environment for RNA regulation."

The requested spectrometer is intended to replace aging instrumentation that is heavily utilized by multiple NIH investigators, but for which there is no longer vendor support to maintain these now technically obsolete spectrometers. Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to begin the process of updating and replacing the aging NMR spectrometers in the Analytical NMR Core Facility, while simultaneously enhancing sensitivity and reintroducing high-throughput sampling capabilities. Our primary focus is to secure modern NMR instrumentation for open-access small molecule characterization and structural elucidation, catalyst development, and monitoring of reaction interaction dynamics. Increased sensitivity and automation (compared to current 30 year old spectrometers that serve as work-horses for these experiments) will greatly enhance the efficiency of our NIH funded research and accelerate discovery. Specifically, acquisition of this instrument will support research efforts of six NIH funded laboratories in the Department of Chemistry, several additional labs funded through federal or private foundation funding sources, as well as the University?s Synthetic and Medicinal Chemistry Core Facility (USMCC), which supports multiple NIH projects across campus. Increased sensitivity will enhance user ability to prepare and characterize new small molecules with biomedical significance in an efficient manner. These discoveries improve human health, primarily addressing problems in infectious disease, macroreticular degeneration/glaucoma and cancer. Enhanced sensitivity across multiple nuclei including 1H, 13C, 19F and 31P coupled with robust variable temperature (VT) control will enable the ability to more efficiently interrogate reaction dynamics and catalysis toward discovery of new reactions for the efficient preparation of novel molecules that impact human disease and fundamental problems in energy. Automation will streamline the acquisition of 1D and 2D NMR spectra primarily for laboratories that require significant throughput of small molecule characterization."

To accomplish this, the DDSB provides a comprehensive range of services spanning computational methods; high throughput screening (HTS); advanced synthetic methods to produce small molecules, peptides, and challenging oligonucleotides; and structural and biophysical methods. These services provide City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (COHCCC) members with a cohesive platform to rapidly and successfully drive their therapeutic development efforts to meaningful outcomes. All major equipment and instrumentation for the DDSB is located in the Flower building. This includes an extensive array of liquid handling robots; peptide and oligonucleotide synthesizers; multiple incubators and fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) systems for protein production and purification; analytical instrumentation to characterize molecular interactions (surface plasmon resonance [SPR], isothermal titration calorimetry [ITC], analytical ultracentrifugation, circular dichroism [CD] with thermal control, etc.); NMR and mass spectrometers for small molecules; and equipment for macromolecular determinations (crystallization and visualization robots and a diffractometer). The DDSB core is co-directed by Drs. David Horne and John Williams, Professors in the Department of Molecular Medicine at the Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, and supported by highly qualified staff that maintain and operate the equipment while also providing training to COHCCC researchers who wish to operate instruments independently. Oversight is provided by an interdisciplinary faculty Advisory Committee, and user feedback through an annual survey. Since the last competitive renewal, the core contributed to 219 publications by CC members, served 121 unique investigators, 100 (83%) of whom were CC members and represent all five Programs. Of the 100 CC members, 86 had peer-reviewed funding. In addition, since the last competitive renewal, the DDSB has synthesized more than 300 small molecules, 500 peptides, and 950 oligonucleotides (aptamers, GpC-conjugates, etc.). During that same period, over 450 crystallization and optimization trials were conducted, over 250 crystals were screened for diffraction, over 40 novel crystal structures/complexes were determined, and over 300 SPR experiments, 35 in silico screening/molecular dynamics projects, and 23 HTS projects were conducted. The DDSB has also developed synthetic methods and processes leading to full-scale production of complex small molecules under GMP conditions. Efforts stemming from the DDSB have led to 32 technology/patent portfolios involving 76 patents (pending and allowed), four licenses, and a substantial sponsored research agreement (>$1M)."
"9564053","Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual?s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer?s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual?s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need."
"9548006","ABSTRACT  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important public health problem. Currently, the ability to objectively assess TBI is a critical research gap. CT and conventional structural MRI have proven to be highly effective in identifying macroscopic lesions. However, these standard imaging techniques have clear limitations in assessing important microscopic lesions and neurologic pathology. The clinical diagnosis of TBI via imaging, particularly mild TBI, remains controversial, because the brain often appears quite normal on conventional CT and MRI. Therefore, new sensitive surrogate biomarkers for TBI are greatly needed in routine clinical practice. Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging is an important molecular MRI technique that can generate contrast based on tissue pH or concentrations of endogenous mobile proteins and peptides. In our preliminary study, we have applied the APTw-MRI approach to a rat TBI model, induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI). Our preliminary results have demonstrated unique APTw-MRI signal characteristics at different time points after injury that are associated with ischemia (at a few hours) and neuroinflammation (at 2-3 days). Notably, APT imaging revealed an acidosis-based ischemic penumbra around the impacted area at a few hours post-injury. These initial results are very promising. However, further development and radiographic-histopathologic validation with different TBI models and at other research sites is crucial for translating this innovative technology and these important results to the clinic. The overall goal of this application is to demonstrate the feasibility, potential, and reproducibility of protein-based APT-MRI signals as functional markers for TBI using animal models of mild, moderate, or severe TBI. We hypothesize that molecular imaging using APT-MRI can sensitively and non-invasively visualize ischemic damage, inflammatory responses, and several other key pathological processes in TBI, thus improving the capability of MRI to objectively assess TBI. Our three specific aims are: (i) to assess APT-MRI spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of TBI and the underlying pathological mechanisms in rat CCI models; (ii) to assess whether APT-MRI predicts therapeutic outcomes in rat CCI models; and (iii) to validate the sensitivity and reliability of APT-MRI in assessing TBI at external sites. Molecular imaging of TBI using APT-MRI opens up a new research area of APT imaging that could address many unmet clinical needs. If our aims in this preclinical study are achieved, the results will provide the solid foundation required to translate this important MRI technology to clinical studies in patients with TBI."
"9458667","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The institute of Medicine's recent report on geographic variation in Medicare spending found that spending for post-acute care is the single biggest cause for the variation. Medicare spends nearly as much on post- acute care and readmission as it does for the original admission in patients hospitalized for conditions such as CHF, pneumonia and COPD. Changes in post-acute care have been rapid and complex, driven by changes in models of reimbursement. We have shown that strategies to reduce cost of hospitalization can contribute to decreased continuity of care, increased readmissions, and greater overall Medicare costs. There is surprisingly little information on the trajectories of car involving hospitalized patients. Over the past five years we have begun to describe the complex trajectories of care of hospitalized patients using Medicare data. A previously unexamined but important adverse outcome of hospitalization is a permanent transfer to long term care of individuals who previously resided in the community. We found that three quarters of all new admissions to long term care (LTC) nursing homes (not SNFs) are preceded by a hospitalization. In most of those cases the patient was initially discharged to a SNF, and later transferred to a LTC nursing home. We now wish to turn our full attention to post hospital care, addressing the following Specific Aims: 1. Estimate the rate of patients ultimately residing in a long term care nursing home after hospitalization  and after a SNF stay in the U.S, their length of stay once admitted to a LTC nursing home, the percent  that are ultimately discharged from the LTC nursing home to the community, and patient characteristics  associated with these outcomes. 2. Determine hospital-level and SNF-level factors associated with risk of subsequent long term care,  independent of patient-level factors. Hospital level factors include size, ownership, teaching status, the  adjusted percentage of its inpatients that are discharged to SNFs, and hospital quality ratings. SNF  level factors include size, ownership, whether it also has long term care beds, staffing patterns, and  quality ratings. 3. Assess the impact of state regulations and changes in federal and state regulations on rates of LTC  post-hospitalization and post SNF. State regulations will be assessed directly (e.g. participation in the  Money Follows the Person initiative) and indirectly (e.g. long term nursing home bed supply, supply of  community alternatives to institutionalization)."
"9541306","PROJECT SUMMARY Elucidating the role of the RUNX1 transcription factor in control of chromatin architecture and genomic regulation in breast cancer initiation is meaningful from a biological perspective, and has potential to be clinically relevant. RUNX1 interacts with mediators of signaling pathways, chromatin remodeling factors, and chromatin organizing proteins at gene regulatory regions to coordinate cell proliferation, growth and differentiation. Our recent results indicate that RUNX1 functions to decrease tumor growth, prevent epithelial to mesenchymal transition, mediate higher-order chromatin organization, and suppress key genes implicated in breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) pathology. My preliminary results suggest that RUNX1 suppresses PI3K and MTOR pathway genes (eg. PIK3R1, PIK3C2A, SOS1), cytokines (eg. IL1a, CXCL8, JAK2) and other key genes (eg. HIF1a, UPAR, and ZEB1) and a novel subset of genes that were identified by RNA-seq comparing BCSCs to non-BCSCs. BCSCs are capable of self-renewal, drive tumor growth, resist chemotherapy, and cause cancer relapse. Consistent with the putative role of RUNX1 in these processes, low RUNX1 expression in breast tumors is associated with poor prognosis. My central hypothesis is that RUNX1 regulates expression of target genes that are dysregulated in BrCa progression, and that its role in mediating higher-order chromatin organization is essential to these functions. I propose to determine the mechanisms by which RUNX1 functions in basal breast cancer, with an emphasis on its influence on BCSCs (CD24-low/CD44+high) versus non-BCSCs (CD24+high/CD44-low). The regulation of key genes specifically within non-BCSCs or BCSCs will be established by flow sorting followed by qPCR, and ChIP-qPCR for RUNX1 binding sites nearby these genes. The impact of RUNX1 loss on early stage breast cancer progression and BCSCs will be determined using murine mammary fat pad injection. Next, we will examine the role of RUNX1 in mediating enhancer regulation and higher order chromatin organization of these key genes in BCSCs, and how this organization is altered by depleting RUNX1 in normal and early-stage breast cancer cells. These studies will employ high-throughput, high resolution capture chromatin conformation capture (capture Hi-C). I hypothesize that BCSCs present an altered higher order chromatin organization, consistent with their stem-like expression profile, and that the loss of RUNX1 induces higher order chromatin organization that is more stem-like for these key genes. Mechanistic insight into genome architecture and expression in basal breast cancer cells and BCSCs will enhance capabilities for selectively targeting breast tumors, as well as BCSCs that are refractory to conventional treatments. These studies will form a solid basis for my future career focus on genomic organization and expression in cancer initiation and progression."
"9468437","Project Summary/Abstract Exposure to maternal depressive symptoms is one of the most well established risk factors for the development of later child psychopathology. Accumulating evidence from naturalistic observational studies documents that fetal exposure to maternal depressive symptoms is associated with risk for later child mental health problems. Maternal depression is one of the most common prenatal complications with approximately 40% of women experiencing elevated levels of depressive symptoms. The majority of past research has been correlational, so potential causal conclusions have been limited. This project will break new ground by testing the hypothesis that manipulating maternal depressive symptoms will benefit infant outcomes. In this project, maternal depressive symptoms will be reduced using brief interpersonal therapy (IPT), a well-established and efficacious treatment, and testing whether this reduction leads to an improvement in the development of infant mechanisms associated with risk for later psychopathology. Consistent with NIMH's priority of Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)-based processes, we will assess infants with multiple measures that assess the constructs of potential threat (?anxiety?) from the Negative Valence System and cognitive (effortful) control from the Cognitive System. We propose to assess 300 pregnant women who report elevated levels of depressive symptoms and their infants. Prior to the intervention, maternal measures will be collected. Then half of the women will be randomized to receive IPT and the other half will receive enhanced usual care. After completion of the intervention, maternal measures will be collected longitudinally through 14 months postpartum. Infants will be evaluated at birth and at 7- and 14-months corrected age. Infants will be assessed across four units of analysis (brain structure and function, physiology, behavior, and maternal-report)."
"9459810","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Muscle mass, function, and tissue repair after injury decrease with aging in skeletal muscle. Autophagy appears to play a critical role, but what the effects might be are still controversial. Confounding factors are the multiple types of cells present in the muscle (e.g. muscle fibers, satellite cells, macrophages), which may have different autophagy requirements, and how the autophagy machinery targets specific organelle types (e.g. mitochondria or lipid droplets). It is not known how autophagy changes in coexisting cell types in the aging skeletal muscle, how prevalent are organelle-specific autophagy, and whether there is coordination between organelle-specific autophagy types. Techniques to pinpoint to the molecular and cellular pathways behind the changes observed in complex tissues and co-existing forms of autophagy are not readily available. In order to address some of the current technological limitations, this application proposes the development and use of mass cytometry to carry out single cell proteomics and individual organelle capillary electrophoresis to investigate organelle populations of autophagy in aging skeletal muscle. The aims of this proposal are: (1) Establish mass cytometry strategies to monitor at the single cell level autophagy-related molecular changes in muscle fibers, macrophages, and satellite cells. (2) Establish individual-organelle capillary electrophoretic strategies that selectively describe lipophagy and mitophagy in muscle fibers, macrophages, and satellite cells. (3) Define changes in lipophagy, mitophagy and global autophagy in a murine model of aging under basal and tissue injury/repair conditions using the methodologies developed under Aims 1 and 3. Completion of the proposed work will provide new technological advances to fine tune the characterization of autophagy and will provide more concrete answers to the controversial role of autophagy in the aging of the skeletal muscle system."
"9490083","Project Summary: The Drosophila Genomics Resource Center (DGRC) supports the international community of scientists utilizing Drosophila melanogaster for biomedical research. The mission of the DGRC is to 1) provide broad access to genomics resources by acquiring, archiving, curating, and distributing genomics resources including clones, vectors, and cell lines; 2) facilitate effective use of these genomics resources by providing guidance and support; and 3) improve the genomics resources and protocols available for Drosophila research. By preserving vital research materials and distributing them efficiently, the DGRC assures economical access and enhances scientific rigor and reproducibility. The first aim of this proposal is to continue and strengthen the successful DGRC programs for acquiring, distributing genomics resources and facilitating their effective use. This will include augmenting and updating data management systems, the web interface and user support, as well as continuing the effective cost recovery program. The goal is to maximize the long-term viability of the DGRC and its benefits to users and the NIH. The second aim is to increase the utility of Drosophila as a model system by generating new resources through four projects: 1) surveying the transfection and CRISPR/Cas9 efficiency of gene tagging across modENCODE cell lines, 2) generating a universal CRISPR/Cas9 based transfection toolkit for the insertion of constructs and the subsequent ability to generate stable transformants in any Drosophila cell line, 3) establishing a neuroblast cell line as a model for stem cell biology, and 4) creating new metabolic sensors for characterizing physiological processes in cell lines and Drosophila tissues."
"9460367","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pemphigus is a class of devastating epidermal blistering diseases in which autoantibodies are generated against cell-cell adhesion molecules present in the skin and mucous membranes. Pemphigus IgG target desmosomes, a structure that couples the keratin intermediate filament network to regions of strong cell-cell adhesion. In pemphigus vulgaris (PV), the primary target of the autoantibodies is desmoglein-3 (Dsg3), a member of the desmosomal cadherin subfamily of adhesion molecules. The work outlined in this proposal investigates the fundamental mechanisms of desmosome assembly and disassembly in human keratinocytes and how these processes are disrupted by PV patient IgG. A major focus of the proposal is how desmosomal proteins are targeted to lipid raft membrane microdomains, and how the association of desmosomal proteins with lipid rafts regulates desmosome formation and disassembly in response to pemphigus IgG. We hypothesize that desmosomal protein targeting to lipid rafts is essential for desmosomal protein clustering during desmosome assembly, and for endocytosis of desmosomal cadherins during disassembly in response to PV IgG. We will utilize PV patient samples, including skin biopsies and purified PV IgG, to determine how PV IgG affect desmosomes in human skin and to determine how PV IgG impact Dsg3 adhesive function using cell biological and single molecular biophysical approaches. Additionally, we will define the amino-acid determinants in Dsg3 that target the protein to lipid rafts and, using mutants deficient in raft targeting, determine how association with lipid rafts impacts desmoglein function. Similar studies will be performed with desmosomal plaque proteins such as the plakophilins and desmoplakin to determine the hierarchy of desmosome protein association with lipid raft membrane domains. These experimental approaches will be integrated to advance our understanding of basic cellular mechanisms of keratinocyte adhesion and to reveal how these mechanism are compromised in a serious epidermal blistering disorder."
"9559760","Microglia in the central nervous system are infected at early times following human or non- human primate infection with HIV-1. Microglia are infected early in the course of HIV disease in humans, and may represent a source of virus transmission or act as a reservoir of virus. Infection of microglia plays a role in HIV-associated dementia and other forms of HIV-associated neurological disease. Myeloid cells outside the CNS have been recently shown to capture HIV-1 particles through interactions between Siglec-1 and gangliosides on the viral lipid envelope. Particle capture and uptake by Siglec-1 leads to the formation of an intracellular compartment termed the virus-containing compartment (VCC) in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). The VCC is also a potential contributor to a persistent viral reservoir and forms an immune- privileged compartment. The mechanisms of HIV-1 particle capture by microglia within the CNS have not yet been defined, and may differ from that of MDMs. Furthermore, the formation of the VCC has not been studied in microglia. Experiments in Aim 1 will define the mechanism of HIV particle capture and uptake by microglia and compare these to MDMs. The role of Siglec-1 and virion membrane gangliosides will be determined, and the role of inflammatory stimuli on capture and uptake quantified. Aim 2 will characterize the formation of the VCC within infected microglia, and will measure transmission of VCC virus to target cells. The potential of microRNA-124-induced microglial quiescence to prolong the viability of the VCC reservoir will be explored. Efforts to target the VCC will be performed using GM3-coated nanoparticles bearing neutralizing antibodies."
"9458719","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in seven people living with HIV (PLH) in the U.S. cycle throughout the criminal justice system each year. While studies show that up to 70% of inmates living with HIV who are prescribed ART can achieve viral suppression during their incarceration, this benefit is not sustained after release into the community. In order to help decrease HIV-related morbidity and mortality among former inmates with HIV and to reduce HIV transmission to their community contacts, more information is needed regarding longitudinal HIV outcomes as inmates cycle between the criminal justice system and the community. Connecticut (CT) is unusual in that it has an integrated correctional system which, combined with CT's statewide HIV/AIDS surveillance monitoring system (eHARS), provides a novel opportunity to study the longitudinal interactions between HIV continuity of care and criminal justice involvement. By linking multiple CT Department of Correction databases with CT's HIV/AIDS surveillance system, this F30 application is poised to determine the relationship between incarceration, release into the community, and the continuity of HIV care. By using a retrospective cohort of PLH released from CT prisons and jails between 2007-2013, the Specific Aims for this application are to: (1) use survival analysis to assess HIV treatment outcomes and engagement in care after release from correctional facilities in CT; (2) use time-varying effect modeling to evaluate longitudinal trends in HIV viral suppression during incarceration compared to time in the community, based on type and extent of interaction with the justice system; and (3) use group-based trajectory mixture modeling to identify groups of individuals demonstrating distinct viral load trends indicative of poor HIV management. Exploratory aims are to identify and describe HIV outcomes for particularly high-risk (i.e., female and ethnic/racial minority) sub-populations through both hypothesis-drive analysis and data mining. The innovative linkage and analysis of community-based clinical data and integrated correctional data at a statewide level will allow for the first study to follow both recidivists and non-recidivists in the community and o use advanced longitudinal methods to evaluate HIV outcomes during time in the community as compared to imprisonment. The proposed study will identify key time points at which former inmates are at highest risk for developing poor HIV outcomes. Findings will help community and correctional system-based healthcare interventions target the highest risk groups of individuals at the time points that would be most beneficial. Through this three-year fellowship, the applicant will gain training in advanced biostatistical methods for the analysis of longitudinal an big data with mentorship from a multidisciplinary research team at Yale University. The training plan outlined in this application aims to prepare her to apply for an NIH K/R award, furthering her career as an independent clinician-investigator generating data to directly inform health policy and clinical interventions to effectively treat HIV/AIDS in vulnerable populations."

"9462810","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent work has yielded new insight into how the body eliminates small immune complexes (sic) from the blood. We have long known that pathogenic IC, depositing in organs like kidneys, cause inflammation and disease such as glomerulonephritis and SLE. However, by far the majority of these ic are eliminated harmlessly by the liver, most believe by its macrophages (Kupffer cells, kc). Further, a particular Fc receptor, FcgRII (RIIb), expressed on B cells, macro- phages, and dendritic cells, is known to temper ic-mediated disease. With this background, these investigators present two remarkably novel findings: first, that RIIb on liver sinusoidal endothelium (lsec), not liver kc, eliminate th major fraction of sic from blood, and, second, that three-quarter of the body's RIIb is expressed on the lsec. Based on this information they hypothesize that RIIb on the lsec eliminates sic from blood and protects against SLE and other ic- mediated disease in humans and mice. This hypothesis has four specific predictions, each a specific aim of the proposal. The first aim affirms the hypothesis by measuring rates of in vivo decay of infused ic in conditional and chimeric knockout mice; and by showing that a wide spectrum of ic are effective in the same in vivo rate-of-decay measurement. The second aim isolates and purifies scavenger cells from liver and makes use of these in vitro for dissecting the mechanism of RIIb-mediated pinocytosis on lsec. The third aim is that clearance is efficient, rapid, recoverable, and robust; a prediction approached by careful kinetic analysis of in vivo de- cay; and confirmed by in vitro studies. The fourth aim is that RIIb controls the manifestations of inflammatory ic-mediated disease, a prediction approached using an experimental model of mouse serum sickness in mouse strains in which RIIb has been ablated in select tissues. The outcomes expected are that the lsec and not the kc is the major liver scavenger for sic; that RIIb on the lsec and not on myeloid or B cell is the operant scavenging receptor; that the capacity of the clearance mechanism is robust; that serum sickness can easily be produced in the absence of RIIb; and that lsec RIIb clearance of ic likely contributes to SLE and other ic-mediated dis- ease. The project challenges existing orthodoxy that the kc is the major liver scavenger for immune complexes, suggesting instead that the lsec is the scavenger. As well the project presents a new paradigm whereby RIIb on lsec clears pathogenic ic, thus protecting the host from ic-mediated inflammatory diseases such as SLE."
"9465240","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Abstract A reversible non-hormonal male contraceptive that is reliable, safe, and easy to use will provide a significant option for men who want to take an active role in family planning. The current primary choices for men are vasectomy and condoms, but each has problems with reversibility and surgical risk, or compliance, respective- ly. There is currently a paucity of druggable targets in drug development for reversible non-hormonal male con- traception. Protein kinases that are critical for cell cycle progression during spermatogenesis that are drugga- ble offer promise as targets for contraceptive development. In this regard, cyclin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CDK2) is such a target. CDK2-/- knockout mice are viable but sterile. CDK2 through its interaction with cyclins A and A1 targets retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and p53 for phosphorylation. Both of these proteins are present in human and murine testis, and play critical roles in testis development, and in regulation of transition through the spermatogenic cell cycle. Therefore, a drug that effectively inhibits CDK2 should block spermatogenesis, thereby causing infertility due to lack of sperm. Since CDK2 is an enzyme that effects meiotic division, once the drug is no longer taken, meiosis should resume and sperm production recovers.  The primary hypothesis for this research is that novel small molecule specific inhibitors of CDK2 can be developed as novel non-hormonal reversible male contraceptive agents. To prove this hypothe- sis, the following specific aims will be achieved:  Specific Aim 1. Identify and rank known inhibitors of CDK2 that reversibly inhibit spermatogenesis in rats.  Specific Aim 2. Develop novel CDK2 allosteric and type I and II kinase inhibitors as leads to improve CDK2 specificity, in vivo anti-spermatogenic efficacy, and minimize side effects.  Specific Aim 3. Demonstrate proof-of-concept reversible contraceptive efficacy of CDK2 inhibitors  To achieve specific aims, we will undertake two lines of research to develop novel CDK2 inhibitors as male contraceptives. First, we will improve the CDK2 specificity for potent nanomolar type I and type II kinase inhibitors that we recently developed. This approach of building in specificity has worked for us before. Second, we will pursue the development of novel CDK2 modulators via an allosteric site that we recently discovered, as these may provide greater opportunities to have CDK2-specific selectivity and minimize cross reactivity with other members of the kinase family. In order to be a successful and viable male contraceptive agent, efficacy, safety, and recovery of fertility will need to be comparable to the oral female contraceptive pill. Based on our experience and success in ongoing contraceptive development projects, one of which is currently in pre-clinical development under FDA guidance, we expect this project to produce novel CDK2 inhibitors with high promise to meet the goal of a safe, effective, and easy to use reversible male contraceptive agent."
"9437675","Project Summary/ Abstract The overall goal of this project is identification of master activators of skeletal myogenic program through a novel gain of function (GOF) genome-scale gene activation screening. Although well-known myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs including MYF5, MYOD, MRF4 and MYOGENIN) and their upstream specification genes (PAX3, PAX7) have been identified and studied extensively, their upstream regulators are less known.  In this context, identification of novel activators of myogenic program is very important not only for better understanding of the developmental biology of muscle, also for identification of genes involved in muscle stem cell activation, regeneration and maintenance. On the other hand, since gain of function studies has been limited by traditional cDNA over-expression shortcomings, this area of research have been less explored. Fortunately, the recent advent of genome-wide sgRNA activator library provides a novel opportunity for GOF gene screen in mammalian cells.  We have recently generated knock-in myogenic lineage reporter human ES/iPS cell lines for early myogenic lineage genes using CRISPR/Cas9 system. These cells provide novel tools to study in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells toward skeletal myogenic progenitors. Therefore, by using these reporter ES/iPS cells for genome-scale sgRNA-activator library screen, we have a unique opportunity to activate and screen all known human gene isoforms for their potential to induce myogenic program.  Therefore, in this exciting and exploratory R21 application, as the 1st aim, we plan to perform sgRNA lentiviral library screen on our skeletal myogenic reporter hES/iPS cell lines. After isolation of activated cells, genomic DNA will be analyzed by deep sequencing to identify integrated sgRNAs and eventually their associated genes which are able to activate myogenic reporters. These data leads to identification of candidate genes which might behave as potential upstream activators for PAX3/7 or MYF5.  Subsequently, in the 2nd aim of this proposal, we will validate each candidate gene using a) individual sgRNA activation, b) cDNA over-expression and c) myogenic differentiation experiments. This validation is to confirm gene activation is a direct result of upstream gene over-expression and rule out the off-target effects of the sgRNAs. Finally cDNA over-expression approach will be further investigated by in vitro myogenic differentiation of the cells to validate specificity of the upstream activators for initiation of skeletal myogenesis.  Therefore, the outcome of this novel and exploratory genome-wide screen provides invaluable information regarding the upstream activators of skeletal myogenesis. These data can be used for developmental studies as well as identification of potential therapeutic targets involved in skeletal muscle regeneration as well as iPS cell based therapies in muscle wasting and disorders."
"9559319","Project Summary This Phase II SBIR project will develop, optimize, test, commercialize, and take to market an inhalation chamber that mimics the e-cigarette technology being used by human users, and being popularized by e- cigarette manufacturers and advertisers. E-cigarette use and abuse is a major public health concern, but little is known about the biology underlying e-cigarette use and negative health impact of e-cigarettes, which makes it difficult for government agencies to regulate these products. Current animal models are inadequate for examining the biological effects and addictive properties of e-cigarettes in a model that delivers vapor to animals in the same way humans self-administer it. Therefore, the major purpose of this proposal is to develop a nicotine e-cigarette vapor instrument to fill this gap in the market and in the e-cigarette research field. Our general approach will be to develop and install design modifications to our current vapor administration systems that include changes to hardware (Aims 1&2), software and user interface (Aim 3), and vaporized solutions (Aim 4), and each of these design modifications will be tested in rats. Comprehensive dosage charts will be developed as part of Aim 4. This phase II SBIR application proposes work that will be critical for developing and optimizing a device that allows for nicotine vapor self-administration in rodents, using the identical technology and route of delivery experienced by human users. The marketability for this type of device is high because there is no such device currently on the market, and also because this research area is a high funding priority for government agencies. Therefore, our major goal is to develop and market a device that allows for customizable and reliable e-cigarette vapor self-administration in rats."

By empowering youth, conducting workshops, collaborating with communities to develop further research and interventions, developing culturally responsive multimedia science communication tools, and modeling innovative best practices in community engagement, the CEC extends the reach and impact of the science and technological innovations emanating from our SRC. The CEC builds the capacity of vulnerable communities in U.S. EPAs Region 9 and part of Mexico to identify, prioritize and resolve environmental and public health issues related to environmental exposures and Superfund toxicants. The overarching goal is to help prevent toxicant exposure, narrow health disparities, reduce NAFLD and TASH susceptibility, reverse the escalating increase in NAFLD and minimize the risk of TASH, especially in communities that are predominantly Hispanic and Native American. Utilizing an integrative, Sustainability Science, place-based approach with a strong commitment to civic engagement, the CEC will build on our existing community-university partnerships. We will work at sites where, for the past five years, we have been directing best practices in community engagement for exposure prevention and intervention. We are co-designing these interventions through bidirectional interaction with our community partners facilitated through our main community partner the Global Action Research Center in San Diego. The CEC will share SRC science and technology through participatory neighborhood-based educational workshops, trainings, citizen science, youth leadership development, and cumulative impact risk communication. Our approach is rooted in sustainable urban agricultural practices (community gardens and food forests) and the installation of green infrastructure (e.g., ecological landscape and biotic modifications) designed to manage/harvest stormwater and urban runoff in ways that reduce the amount of, and exposure to, urban toxicant contaminants."
"9522906","PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation therapy plays a key role in the treatment of many cancers. Despite its widespread use, we cannot currently identify the patients most likely to benefit from this form of treatment. Neuroblastoma is a malignancy that occurs predominantly in young children. Patients with high-risk disease are treated with maximally intensive therapy, however survival rates for newly diagnosed patients remain poor. Neuroblastoma is sensitive to radiation, and the targeted radiopharmaceutical 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) is active in this disease. 131I-MIBG is being evaluated in a randomized Phase III trial as a component of frontline treatment for children with high-risk neuroblastoma (Children's Oncology Group ANBL1531). Preliminary studies suggest that tumor and host markers may predict clinical outcomes after 131I-MIBG. As part of ANBL1531, we will evaluate biomarkers that may identify patients most likely to experience a survival advantage after treatment, and could help to identify those patients most likely to experience toxicity related to 131I-MIBG therapy. To evaluate potential biomarkers that could aid in selection of patients for 131I-MIBG therapy, we propose two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will study features of neuroblastoma tumors that may predict outcome after 131I- MIBG. We will assess expression of transporter proteins in tumors from patients treated with and without 131I- MIBG, using specimens obtained at diagnosis and at the time of definitive surgery. In addition, we will evaluate the mutation status and the expression of genes related to neuroblastoma biology and radiation sensitivity. In Aim 2, we will evaluate host factors that may influence survival and toxicity related to 131I-MIBG therapy. We will use normal tissue (blood cells) from patients treated with and without 131I-MIBG to look for mutations that may underlie differences in sensitivity to radiation. In addition, we will study changes in expression of relevant genes in blood samples taken before and after 131I-MIBG exposure to elucidate the basis for differential radiation effects among patients. At the end of this project, we will have identified biomarkers that can be used to select patients with neuroblastoma who are most likely to benefit from 131I-MIBG therapy. Our work may result in improved therapy selection for patients with other cancers and improved understanding of differential clinical responses to therapeutic radiation."
"9545236","Project Summary/ Abstract Ca-Calmodulin dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) is an important regulator of cardiac function, and dysfunction in pathological states, regulating ion channels, Ca transporters, myofilaments and nuclear transcription. CaMKII may normally fine-tune these processes. But in pathological conditions chronic autonomous CaMKII over-activation can hyerphosphorylate targets, contributing to arrhythmogenesis due to acute effects on several ion channels and Ca-handling proteins. Chronic CaMKII activation is also a hallmark of several pathological states and acute or genetic CaMKII inhibition can reduce arrhythmias and the progression of HF. Thus understanding fundamental aspects of CaMKII regulation in cardiac myocytes is critical understanding dysfunction and potential therapeutics. We and others discovered several novel post-translational modifications (PTMs) that can trap CaMKII in an activated state, rather than turning on & off rapidly with local Ca transients. Autophosphorylation, oxidation, GlcNAcylation and S-nitrosylation within a regulatory hotspot on CaMKII creates memory and autonomous activity, even when Ca/CaM falls. The functional synergy among these PTMs is unknown, but will be directly measured in myocytes in Aim 1. Dogma has been that CaMKII-dodecamers neither exchange subunits nor move appreciably in myocytes, but our preliminary data upends both dogmas, and this will be elucidated in Aim 2. S-nitrosylation, the newest regulatory PTM, can either promote autonomous activation (C290) or inhibit Ca/CaM activation (C273). Aim 3 will test the functional impact of these sites in adult myocytes and in acute ischemia/reperfusion and long-term pressure overload in intact animals. We will use multiple innovative fluorescence tools and methods, and animals to test these 3 major CaMKII? Aims. The proposed studies will have major impact on our understanding of how CaMKII activity is regulated in heart, in ways that promote pathology and might be targets for therapeutic intervention."
"9454215","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical studies report a higher incidence of ischemic heart disease and mortality after myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty, or cardiac surgery in patients older than 60 years of age, which appear to be related to a decline in intrinsic myocardial resistance to injury. The mechanisms responsible for age-related ischemic intolerance are incompletely understood and the signaling pathways involved in regulating cellular responses to ischemia/reperfusion remain largely unknown. We recently reported that an aging-associated reduction in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling is an important contributing factor leading to increased sensitivity to ischemic stress via modulation of the glucose transporter (GLUT4) translocation. Intriguingly, Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a longevity protein, is emerging as a potential AMPK downstream target involved in heart disease. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the impaired AMPK-SIRT1 signaling cascade in the aged heart contributes to intolerance to ischemic insults in the elderly. We will test this hypothesis to investigate the importance of SIRT1 signaling in the susceptibility of the aged heart to ischemic insults. Aim 1: To characterize the SIRT1 activation in the aged heart during ischemia/reperfusion; Aim 2: To determine the role of SIRT1 in regulating cardiac function during ischemia-reperfusion stress; Aim 3: To evaluate the capability of a small-molecule AMPK or SIRT1 agonist to improve ischemia/reperfusion-induced adaptive response in the aged heart. In this manner, we will advance our understanding of the mechanisms behind aging-associated alterations in cardiac SIRT1 signaling pathways in response to ischemic stress. Furthermore, we propose a novel therapeutic strategy that might up-regulate cardiac SIRT1 signaling and thus protect against ischemia- induced cardiac injury in this segment of population."
"9458105","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aim of this proposal is to identify immunological mechanisms that regulate cartilage homeostasis. A variety of skeletal disorders are caused by defects in cartilage homeostasis including osteochondrodysplasias, osteochondromas, and osteoarthritis. Together, these disorders affect millions of people worldwide and lack effective cures. Our preliminary data reveal a novel mouse model of spontaneous osteochondromas characterized by accumulation of chondrocytes at the growth plates of multiple bones, with no apparent inflammatory infiltrate. This disease occurs in mice with a germline deletion of Erk1 bred to mice with a conditional deletion of Erk2 mediated by CD4cre (DKOCD4 mice). Remarkably, this excessive chondrocyte accumulation appears to be regulated by cells of the immune system. While considerable research has established a role for the immune system in bone metabolism and inflammatory joint disorders, we present the first evidence that osteochondromas and chondrocyte proliferation in the growth plate are regulated by the immune system. First, we demonstrate that Erk2 deletion is mediated by CD4cre, which is only known to be expressed in subsets of immune cells, and does not alter Erk2 expression in chondrocytes. Second, we show osteochondromas develop faster and with a greater severity in DKOCD4 mice that lack T cells and B cells. Third, we found that addition of T cells into mice that develop osteochondromas significantly delayed the onset of tumors. Finally, we demonstrate that treating the DKOCD4 mice with an inflammatory stimulus, or housing them in an environment with known pathogens accelerates development of osteochondromas. Thus, we hypothesize that cells of the immune system are important regulators of chondrocyte homeostasis. An improved understanding of this regulation will be critical for devising novel treatment strategies for disorders caused by cartilage defects. To test our hypothesis, we will first determine which cell types promote osteochondroma formation. Second, we will establish which immune cells suppress development of cartilage tumors. Finally, we will investigate if immune regulation of chondrocyte growth is specifically required during development or whether continual regulation is required to control chondrocyte growth. These experiments will lend valuable insight into the components of the immune response that are critical for regulation of chondrocyte proliferation, which could transform how diseases caused by defective cartilage homeostasis are treated."
"9458162","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Eating disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders are two commonly co-occurring, severe neuropsychiatric diseases that affect millions of Americans. Patients with these diseases similarly experience recurrent obsessions followed by compulsive behaviors aimed at reducing distressing thoughts. These debilitating, complex symptoms severely impair a patient's daily life functioning, and current available treatments may reduce the severity of symptoms but do not cure these life-long disorders. To date, the neural pathways underlying these disorders are poorly understood, highlighting a critical need for uncovering the precise neural circuit interactions behind destructive behaviors seen in these diseases. This proposal seeks to achieve a circuit-level understanding of hypothalamic pathways that control feeding and self-grooming in mice, two behaviors that are maladaptive in human eating and obsessive-compulsive disorders, respectively. Optogenetics, a technology that combines genetics with properties of light-activated channels, allows for precise control of specific neural circuit activity. Preliminary experiments utilized optogenetic approaches combined with unique animal models to map and characterize neural circuit projections from the lateral hypothalamus to the paraventricular hypothalamus, two important regions previously implicated in feeding and self-grooming behaviors. The proposal's preliminary data shows that lateral hypothalamic neurons send excitatory and inhibitory monosynaptic input to paraventricular hypothalamic neurons, and light activation of this circuit projection in live animas produces voracious feeding and repetitive grooming behaviors. Importantly, evoked feeding depends on release of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and loss of GABA in LH neurons results in uncontrolled grooming upon light stimulation of the same circuit projection. Additionally, optogenetic activation of PVH neurons induces repetitive grooming. These observations led to the hypothesis that separable, competing inhibitory and excitatory lateral hypothalamic neuron populations control feeding and grooming by modulating paraventricular hypothalamus neuron activity. The experiments proposed in this application will identify the specific neural circuit pathways within the hypothalamus controlling these two important behaviors, allowing for insight into the neural basis for eating disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders and development of novel therapeutic strategies."
"9212679","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anemia is a common problem among older adults occurring in over 10% of community dwelling older persons and exceeding 50% among the frail elderly. A consistent and independent relationship exists between anemia and a heightened risk of adverse consequences in the elderly including impaired function, more disability, worse quality of life, greater hospitalization, and higher mortality. The expanding population of older adults and high prevalence of anemia translates into substantial anemia related morbidity and mortality. As a potentially modifiable factor, anemia is a highly promising target for correction. Nevertheless, interventional studies for anemia in older adults are limited. For the majority of cases of anemia in the elderly, a cause can be identified. However, approximately 1/3rd of cases remain unexplained after initial diagnostic testing. This unexplained anemia in the elderly (UAE) can be clinically defined and also translates into increased mortality. Since the risks and benefits of treatment are unknown, UAE is ideally suited for therapeutic studies. We propose creating the Partnership for Anemia: Clinical and Translational Trials (PACTTE) consortium by partnering the Duke Clinical Research Center as a coordinating center, with a network of sites and accomplished investigators, to design and conduct clinical and translational trials in UAE. To discern the influence of anemia correction in older adults, a uniform panel of geriatric instruments that assess function, quality of life, and cognition will be employed in each trial. Our initial protocol will consist of a randomized treatment trial of (ESA) or placebo among UAE patients 70 years and older. We hypothesize that ESA treatment of UAE will improve self report physical function as measured by the short-form 36 physical component score (SF36-PCS).We believe that hypothesis directed translational studies will lead to key insights that will enable creating a subsequent generation of rationally designed interventional studies. To that end, a biorepository core will be established by obtaining peripheral blood and when available, marrow samples from subjects enrolled on studies. We expect our research will have far-reaching implications ranging from 1) developing a standard panel of geriatric instruments applicable to any anemia interventional trial in older adults 2) determining whether ESA for UAE is safe and adequately improves functional status to justify larger scale clinical trials 3) elucidating major mechanisms leading to UAE that will guide future trials and research.       RELEVANCE: For the majority of cases of anemia in the elderly, a cause can be identified. For some, anemia may be corrected by treating the underlying cause. Nevertheless, approximately 1/3rd of anemia cases remain unexplained after initial diagnostic testing, representing the largest diagnostic category of anemia. This Unexplained anemia in the elderly (UAA) can be clinically defined and also shows increased mortality. As the risks or benefits of treatment are completely unknown, UAE is ideally suited for interventional trials."
"9463418","Summary Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide and is characterized by the formation of senile plaques, extracellular aggregates composed of the protein A? that begin forming more than a decade before the onset of clinical symptoms. Aging is the strongest risk factor for the development of AD, yet the factors that render the aging brain vulnerable to A? deposition remain unknown and no treatments exist that can prevent or reverse this process in the aging brain. We have recently defined a brain-wide perivascular network, termed the `glymphatic' system that facilitates the exchange of interstitial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid, facilitating the clearance of interstitial wastes including A? from the brain. Fluid movement along these pathways and through the brain interstitium is facilitated by the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) which is expressed in a highly polarized manner in astrocyte membranes that directly face the brain vasculature. Genetic deletion of AQP4 slows A? clearance from the brain and accelerates A? plaque deposition in a transgenic mouse model of AD. We have observed that perivascular AQP4 localization is disrupted in both the aging mouse and human cortex, and that in the human cortex, loss of perivascular AQP4 localization is associated with worsening A? plaque burden and AD. Based on these findings, we propose that loss of perivascular AQP4 localization in the aging brain impairs interstitial A? clearance and promotes A? plaque formation. In this proposal, we will use a transgenic mouse model that lacks perivascular AQP4 localization to determine whether loss of AQP4 localization slows interstitial A? clearance. We will then use an in vivo viral transfection approach to test whether upregulation of the AQP4-M23 variant, which is upregulated in the aging brain, disrupts perivascular AQP4 localization and impairs glymphatic pathway function. These two approaches will then be used to determine whether loss of perivascular AQP4 localization, including by AQP4-M23 upregulation, promotes A? plaque deposition in a mouse model of AD that spontaneously develops A? plaques. Using MRI-based imaging of glymphatic function, we will evaluate whether regions of impaired glymphatic function promote local A? plaque deposition. If validated, then these studies may provide a mechanistic basis for the vulnerability of the aging brain to A? aggregation, including an explanation for the vulnerability of certain brain regions to this process early in the disease course. These findings may identify a new therapeutic approach to preventing these processes in the aging brain."
"9459299","Over the past century, we have witnessed remarkable increases in the average life span. Unfortunately, increased longevity is not matched by the typical health span, and most elderly individuals will experience memory decline that interferes with their quality of life and ability to maintain independence. The hippocampus is critical for memory and is one of the brain regions vulnerable in advanced age and Alzheimer?s disease. Because onset of Alzheimer?s disease is generally after the age of 65, the biological foundations of this neurodegenerative disorder are compounded by normal age-associated declines that we do not fully understand. In fact, alterations in the hippocampal circuit with old age could either reflect synaptic senescence or adaptive plasticity compensating to normalize output. Unfortunately, we have insufficient information to distinguish between these two competing hypotheses that would lend to distinct treatment strategies. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to determine the alterations in hippocampal subregion interactions that underlie cognitive dysfunction. The primary objective of the current proposal is to determine how altered communication within the hippocampal circuit in old age produces memory deficits. Linking neurobiology directly to behavior, will allow us to determine if synaptic alterations are adaptive or the underlying cause of dysfunction. We will attain this by testing the central hypothesis that altered communication between CA3 and CA1 results from a deafferentation of the hippocampus from the entorhinal cortical (ERC), which leads to CA3 hyperexcitability. Old animals that maintain high performance, adapt to the loss of ERC input by weakening the CA3 to CA1 Schaffer collateral synapse to impede the propagation of aberrant activity. In contrast, aged animals will impairments show enhanced CA3-CA1 coupling. This hypothesis will be tested with the following specific aims: 1) Determine how CA3-CA1 neuron spike timing contributes to memory decline in old animals, 2) Determine the role of perforant path loss in intrinsic hippocampal dysfunction, and 3) Determine how changes in medial temporal lobe synchrony in old age map onto memory dysfunction. The rationale is that by elucidating how aging and disease influence systems-level dynamics, we will be better positioned to develop interventions that broadly improve cognition. The proposed research is innovative, in our opinion, as neurophysiological techniques will be integrated with measures of behavior in young and aged rats in order to probe how local dysfunction manifests as network impairments or incites compensatory processes. The significance of the successful completion of this work will be to determine how distinct types of cellular dysfunction alter global circuit properties in order to identify and exploit network mechanisms to ultimately improve cognition."
"9519564","ABSTRACT Advance care planning (ACP), including end-of-life (EOL) discussions and decision-making, are important elements for the care of chronically and critically ill patients. Ideally, doctors would have conversations with patients with incurable, life-limiting illnesses about treatment options, based on the patient?s goals and values. These conversations cover how aggressively to treat an illness as well as the option eventually for hospice. These conversations ideally should happen long before a patient dies or becomes too ill to have these discussions. However, in many cases, ACP discussions between patients and providers do not occur. In response to this need for ACP, including EOL discussions and decision-making, some important changes have occurred. Nationally, a framework for standardizing patient preference forms ? Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) or their equivalent ? have been developed and introduced on a state-by-state basis. California adopted POLST in 2009 and began routinely collecting POLST as a supplement (Section S) to the Long-Term Care Minimum Data Set (MDS) for nursing home residents. Nationally, CMS began in January 2016 to reimburse providers to have ACP discussions, creating an incentive for providers to initiate, revisit, and report these discussions. The combination of these two separate policy interventions ? state-by-state implementation of POLST and Medicare reimbursement for ACP discussions ? allow for empiric evaluation of patient preferences and their impact (when collection is encouraged/facilitated) on care choices and outcomes. Using national nursing home data (MDS), California MDS Section S, Medicare enrollment data and FFS claims, and California all-payer hospital data (years 2011 to 2018), we propose the following aims and associated hypotheses for the evaluation of the impact of standardization and financial incentives related to ACP discussions in Medicare enrollees 65 years of age and older:  1. Assess the impact of POLST rollout on utilization of care at EOL and quality of care at the EOL among  FFS Medicare patients in nursing homes nationally.  2. Assess the impact of Medicare FFS payment policy for ACP discussions on utilization of care at EOL  and quality of care at the EOL among FFS Medicare patients in nursing homes nationally.  3. Assess the impact of Medicare payment policy for ACP discussions on POLST completion, patient  preferences, and utilization of care at EOL and quality of care at the EOL in California nursing home  residents enrolled in Medicare. This study will evaluate the policy impact on care for the elderly nationally and will leverage unique routinely collected POLST data from California to quantify the direct impact of physician incentives on patient preferences. Study results will be a catalyst for further innovation in ACP discussions and EOL planning."
"9463354","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal seeks to conduct FDA-required pre-clinical testing of a retinal prosthesis with penetrating electrodes designed and assembled by our team at Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Our retinal prosthesis is designed to restore vision to patients who are blind from either retinitis pigmentosa (RP) or age-related macular degeneration (AMD). There is no treatment to restore lost vision for either disease, although promising research in other fields also offers some hope of being able to help these patients. RP is the leading cause of inherited blindness in the world and is particularly devastating because it causes a slowly progressive loss of vision across the entire visual field of both eyes. AMD, which is the leading cause of blindness in the industrialized world, causes loss of central vision that robs a patient of being able to read or easily recognize faces. Our prosthetic system is composed of two components. The first component is a modified pair of glasses that contains an ultra-small camera that captures details of a visual scene; the glasses are connected to a cell phone-like device that processes the visual images. The digital visual signal and operating power are sent wirelessly to the second component of the prosthetic system, which is implanted around the back of the eye. The implanted component receives the visual signal and a custom-designed computer chip uses the incoming operating power to distribute electrical pulses to the retina. These electrical pulses will initiate nerve impulses tothe brain via the optic nerve. The primary goal of this prosthesis is to improve the quality-of-life of severely blind patients by enabling navigation in unfamiliar environments. Once achieved, the device also has the potential to facilitate other activities of daily living, like reading street sgns, addresses on buildings, bathroom designations (i.e. male vs. female), and finding and reaching accurately for glasses, plates, and utensils, among other things. The quality of vision that can be restored depends substantially upon the number of stimulation channels, or pixels. Our device has the largest number (256) of individually-controllable stimulation channels of any neural prosthetic device in the world. This relatively large number of stimulation channels should provide higher quality vision compared to the other devices. The penetrating electrodes should increase the safety of electrical stimulation and improve the quality of vision over what has been obtained with retinal prosthetic devices that use planar electrodes. Following completion of the work described in this grant proposal, our team would hope to receive an FDA approval to conduct a subsequent Phase I safety study of our retinal prosthesis with penetrating electrodes."
"9543678","Numerous mechanisms have been proposed as contributing factors in the etiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy, ranging from neurohumoral imbalances and extracellular remodeling, to perturbations in the intrinsic properties of cardiomyocytes. In the latter case, imbalances in rates of damage (e.g., oxidative) and replacement (i.e., turnover) of cellular constituents (e.g., proteins, mitochondria) have been implicated in the development of cardiac dysfunction during diabetes. Although many studies have investigated the role of increased oxidative stress, little is known regarding how diabetes impairs the turnover of damaged cellular constituents. Turnover of cellular constituents exhibits a striking time-of-day-dependent variation, which is governed by the cardiomyocyte circadian clock. Moreover, genetic disruption of the clock in the heart temporally suspends these processes, leading to development of dilated cardiomyopathy. Compelling evidence presented within this application suggests that both autophagy and mitophagy (autophagy of mitochondria), processes critical in the repair/replacement of cellular constituents, are circadian regulated in the heart. Our investigation of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock further revealed that the posttranslational modification, protein O-GlcNAcylation, is integral to the clock mechanism; the importance of this relationship is highlighted during diabetes (both type 1 and 2), when chronic elevation of cardiac protein O-GlcNAcylation (secondary to aberrant glucose metabolism) is associated with a phase shift in the clock within the heart. We postulate therefore that disruption of the clock-O-GlcNAc relationship during diabetes causes temporal misalignment of cardiac processes involved in repair/replacement of cellular constituents. These studies have led to the hypothesis that chronic disruption of the clock-O-GlcNAc relationship in the heart during T2DM impairs temporal partitioning of autophagy/mitophagy, ultimately impairing cellular constituent quality control leading to contractile function. In order to test this hypothesis, three Specific Aims are proposed. Aim 1: Demonstrate that the cardiomyocyte circadian clock modulates quality control of cellular constituents through transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of autophagy/mitophagy mediators (Physiologic/Mechanistic Aim). Aim 2: Demonstrate that chronic disruption of the clock-O- GlcNAc relationship during T2DM impairs quality control of cellular constituents through attenuated temporal partitioning of autophagy/mitophagy (Pathologic Aim). Aim 3: Demonstrate that behavior- and/or pharmacologic- mediated normalization of the clock-O-GlcNAc relationship during T2DM attenuates development of cardiac dysfunction (Therapeutic Aim). Successful completion of the proposed studies will lead to new fundamental insights regarding the causal role of circadian disruption in the etiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy, and will help identify innovative approaches for reducing the risk of cardiac dysfunction in diabetic patients."
"9519352","PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) remains a serious public health concern despite recent advances in medicine. Currently available drugs only address symptoms of HF, thus new approaches for curative therapies are sorely needed. Gene therapy has been proposed as one such promising approach; unfortunately, many candidate genes would lead to serious clinical side effects if delivered systemically. Additionally, considerable loss of delivery vectors to off-target organs require high vector doses to be used in order to achieve therapeutic effect at diseased tissue sites. To address these challenges, we propose to engineer adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors that can specifically target cardiac tissue damaged after a myocardial infarction (MI). The key scientific premise of this project is the observation that extracellular proteases, specifically matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are elevated in damaged cardiac tissue post-MI. We have developed a platform of protease- activatable AAV vectors that can deliver genes in response to the MMPs elevated post-MI. Promisingly, upon intravenous injection, our engineered AAV vectors are able to achieve significantly improved targeted gene delivery to the high MMP region of the diseased heart in vivo, and this targeted delivery is accompanied by decreases in delivery to non-target organs. In this R01 project, we aim to design, build, and characterize an improved panel of protease-activatable AAV vectors for HF treatment. In aim 1, we will create AAV vectors that can target different disease stages post-MI. In aim 2, we will use molecular modeling and structural approaches to study the AAV capsid variants and to further improve our vector designs. Then in aim 3, we will use in vivo molecular imaging to characterize the in vivo specificity of the engineered vectors in relation to elevated MMP levels in the heart post-MI. Finally, in aim 4 we will test the therapeutic efficacy of using the protease-activatable AAV vectors in in vivo models of MI-induced HF. Overall, by improving the specificity of AAV vectors for target cardiac tissues, we aim to (i) overcome the need to use invasive administration strategies; (ii) minimize delivery to off-target organs, leading to decreased side effects as well as decreased overall vector dosage needed to achieve therapeutic effect, and (iii) reduce any dose-dependent immune responses against the vector."
"9460368","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Healing following rotator cuff repair remains a significant clinical challenge, and repair failure rates of 20-70% continue to be reported. We postulate that the weak relationships between current measures of structural integrity and such clinical outcomes are due to an imprecise understanding of tendon healing, which limits advances in treatment and rehabilitation strategies aimed to improve healing and outcomes. Structural outcomes currently evaluated with MRI or ultrasound indicate only if the repair is intact, attenuated, or failed, but are inadequate to discern the extent to which the tendon has failed with continuity, i.e., undergone significant tendon retraction in the absence of a discernible defect (gap) in repair continuity. This proposal's objective is to challenge and expand our current definition of rotator cuff healing by investigating tendon retraction - broadly defined as medial translation of the repaired tendon away from the bone with or without a defect - as a common and clinically predictive structural outcome following rotator cuff repair. The approach is to characterize tendon retraction using an array of implanted markers, and investigate its relationships to pre- operative tissue quality (MRI), post-operative repair integrity (MRI) and clinical outcomes in a prospectively enrolled cohort of 125 patients. Pre- and post-operatively, patients will complete validated outcome questionnaires at 6 weeks and repeat these, as well as undergo MRI (repair continuity), CT imaging (tendon retraction) and strength testing, at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Specific Aim 1 will characterize the magnitude, patterns, and timing of tendon retraction for 2 years after rotator cuff repair, and assess its relationship to pre- operative tisue quality and post-operative repair integrity (both by traditional MRI). Specific Aim 2 will assess the extent to which tendon retraction after rotator cuff repair is associated with and can improve prediction of 1- and 2-year strength and patient reported outcomes (PROs). We expect to show that tendon retraction is common, occurs early post-operatively, with or without repair continuity as assessed by traditional imaging, and significantly correlates with clinical outcomes. The immediate and highly significant consequence of this finding would be a paradigm shift in our understanding of tendon repair healing, now incorporating the magnitude, timing and location of tendon retraction as well as the continuity of the repaired tissue. This information would yield a more precise understanding of rotator cuff tendon healing, allowing for advances in treatment strategies that improve surgical healing and clinical outcomes and result in more durable rotator cuff repairs over time."
"9507112","Project Summary Genome sequencing has revealed thousands of mutations associated with various types of cancer. The vast majority of the identified variants are noncoding. A number of seminal studies have revealed that noncoding mutations can disrupt 3D genome architecture and cause cancer. To accelerate discovery in this emerging area of investigation, bioinformatics tools for integrative analysis of mutation and 3D genome organization data is critically needed. In this project, we will develop a suite of bioinformatics tools to predict the hierarchy of 3D genome organization and use such information to interpret and identify causal noncoding mutations. In aim 1, we will develop a method for identifying mutations that disrupt chromatin domain and subdomain boundaries in cancers. In aim 2, we will use disease-relevant enhancer- promoter network for prioritizing mutations that disrupt enhancer function. In aim 3, we will develop a 3D cancer genome database for curating, querying and visualizing chromatin interaction data together with transcriptomic, epigenomic, and mutation data."
"9493177","Abstract This proposal requests funding for the purchase of a BIOSORTER PRO and VAST BioImager, which will be housed in the new core facility operated by the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Kentucky. These complementary instruments are needed for automated handling and high-throughput sorting, imaging and analysis of small model organisms such as zebrafish larvae or fly. The acquisition of VAST BioImager and BIOSORTER PRO would significantly enhance research capabilities at the University of Kentucky and establish best practices for reliable and reproducible biomedical science utilizing small model organisms. These instruments would be the first of their kind in the state of Kentucky and would be an important addition to the region. The BIOSORTER large particle cytometer will replace manual sorting of small model organisms (i.e. fly and zebrafish) and experimental models such as tissue spheroids/organoids, pancreatic islets and other large cell clusters with a fast, sensitive, reproducible automation for gentle sorting and high throughput screens. The VAST BioImager will eliminate manual manipulation of zebrafish larvae by automatically, precisely and reproducibly orienting larvae for high throughput, high-resolution, fluorescent and bright-field imaging while maintaining viability of the organism for further testing. This equipment cluster will serve a growing group of NIH-funded investigators in the Colleges of Art and Sciences, Medicine and Agriculture at the University of Kentucky (UK) who successfully utilize small model organisms to study molecular mechanisms underlying disease, organ and tissue formation and repair. The potential major users conduct NIH sponsored research in areas including studies of organ system development, tissue regeneration, circadian rhythms, the role of scaffolding proteins in hematopoiesis, the regulation of signaling pathways during development, tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration. Minor users with relevant interests and qualifying support are also included. The facility core at UK employs a manager with broad experience in imaging and support of the core facility that will be responsible for a routine oversight, upkeep and operation of the requested instruments. Dr Galperin, the PI of this application, has extensive record of accomplishment in the development and application of imaging methods in biomedical research. The acquisition of this cluster of instruments will significantly enhance research efforts aiming to study organ system development, tissue regeneration, circadian rhythms, the role of scaffolding proteins in hematopoiesis, the regulation of signaling pathways during development and carcinogenesis."
"9473780","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have reported progressively higher prevalence estimates, ranging from 0.07 to our recent report of 2.64%. While the evidence suggests that most of the rise is attributable to greater public awareness, a broadening of the ASD diagnostic criteria and better case ascertainment, it still remains possible that the rising ASD prevalence is associated with increases in ASD incidence. In turn, since purely genetic factors are unlikely to have an impact in such a short period of time increases in ASD incidence suggest that environmental factors and their interactions with genetic vulnerability are mechanisms for increasing risk for ASD.  Detecting the etiological substrates of ASD has proven to be challenging. These difficulties likely arise from the complexity of ASD genetics, including gene-environmental interaction (GEX), insufficient sample sizes and the use of mainly clinical samples that may reflect biased selection.  This proposal is designed to overcome these obstacles, and aims to discover etiologic substrates of ASD and determine their relationship to ASD incidence. This goal will be achieved by first prospectively examining cumulative incidence up to age 7 using 5 successive birth cohorts from Goyang City, South Korea, using a total population strategy and systematic, standardized case identification procedures. In this process, we will establish a systematically-ascertained population-based cohort of children with ASD, their families and sex and IQ matched controls from which we will collect data from medical histories, neuropsychological testing and physical examinations, along with blood for measurement of hormones and putative environmental toxins. With these data, we will examine the role of environmental risks in ASD incidence and phenotype. Finally, we will establish a biorepository of serum for further analyses, including toxins and ASD-related immunological markers, while also creating cell lines and purified DNA that can be used for future genetic and GEX studies. While these materials will be available for a subsequent large scale GEX study in which we will complete whole genome genotyping to provide sufficient coverage for environmentally responsive genes, in years 4 and 5 of the proposed study, we will also examine GEX using rapidly evolving data and replicated genetic markers from ongoing ASD genetic studies.  When the proposed sample collection is completed, it will be analyzed independently and then combined with the data from our large-scale, Simons Foundation-funded epidemiological sample (N=10,000) whose saliva/blood were collected and phenotype was measured for ASD symptoms. This combination will dramatically increase the power and provide substantial opportunities to address ASD genetic architecture, the role of environmental factors and GEX in a large-scale, statistically well-powered, systematically-ascertained, population-based, genetically homogenous group of distinct individuals with ASD, along with matched controls."
"9546300","The taxanes are amongst the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs in clinical oncology, and are a mainstay of treatment in gastric cancer. However, despite their use in both first and second line therapy, patients commonly exhibit intrinsic resistance resulting in marginal benefit. A post hoc analysis of taxane therapy in an international clinical trial (TAX-325) confirmed this observation; we found that GC patients with diffuse histological subtype did not benefit from DTX therapy, suggesting that diffuse GC is may be intrinsically resistant to taxanes. To date, despite the wide use of taxanes in oncology, the molecular underpinnings of clinical taxane resistance remain poorly elucidated. Using preclinical models of GC intrinsic resistance, we identified a novel faster-migrating isoform of the microtubule (MT) plus-end binding protein CLIP-170, hereafter CLIP-170S, which was enriched in GC cell lines with intrinsic taxane resistance. The canonical full-length CLIP-170 protein belongs to the family of MT plus- end-tracking proteins (+TIPs) which accumulate at the distal ends of growing MTs, linking MT ends to various cell structures and regulating MT dynamics. Mass-spec proteomics and 5?RACE revealed that CLIP-170S was missing the first 150 amino acids, including the first Cap-Gly (domain, required for proper +TIP localization. Confocal microscopy experiments showed that CLIP-170S was miss-localized from the MT ends to the MT lattice. Live-cell imaging of native cytoskeletons using fluorescently- labeled paclitaxel (Flutax) revealed significantly faster dissociation rates of Flutax from MTs in the cells expressing CLIP-170S, indicating transient interaction with MTs. Taxane binding to MTs is a two-step process. First, taxanes bind to the MT outer surface by interacting with their low affinity binding site at the MT pore, then, they get internalized to the MT lumen where they bind to their high affinity luminal binding site. Our data using chemical probes specific for the outer and inner surface of the MT pore showed that CLIP-170S expression was associated with decreased binding affinity of taxanes for MTs. Stable knock- down (KD) of CLIP-170S reversed completely taxane resistance (~300-fold)? while KD of the canonical CLIP-170 had no effect on drug activity? thereby, suggesting a cause-effect relationship between CLIP-170S expression and taxane resistance. Together these data led us propose a model where CLIP-170S blocks the MT-pore, impairs taxane binding to the MT outer surface inhibiting taxane access to the high-affinity luminal binding site resulting in drug resistance. We have developed a drug discovery platform, BANDIT (Bayesian Analysis to Identify Drug Interaction Targets), which allows for accurate identification of target proteins for orphan drugs or small molecules. BANDIT identified Imatinib as a drug predicted to be active in taxane-resistant GC cells. Experimental validation showed that Imatinib not only was able to completely reverse taxane resistance, but it did so by inhibiting specifically the expression of CLIP-170S. Our central hypothesis is that CLIP-170S, by lacking the first N-terminus CAP-GLY motif is miss-localized from the +TIP to the MT lattice, obstructing the MT-pore and blocking taxane access to its high affinity luminal drug binding-site. Computational modeling predicted that Imatinib would reverse taxane resistance. Experimental validation of this prediction led us further hypothesize that additional clinically used tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), may share this mode of action with Imatinib, and synergize with taxanes providing a new targeted therapeutic strategy for GC patients."
"9489307","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor TCF4 (aka E2-2) has been implicated broadly in human CNS function. TCF4 was confirmed in several large GWAS studies as one of the rare highly replicated schizophrenia susceptibility genes, and when haplo-insufficient TCF4 is the causative factor for Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS). PTHS has compelling attributes in terms of human cognitive function, being associated with pronounced memory deficits, autistic behaviors, and importantly an almost complete lack of language development. Thus, understanding the roles and function of TCF4 in the CNS is highly significant with respect to human language and auditory cognition, memory function, autism spectrum behavior, and schizophrenia susceptibility. Despite the clear importance of TCF4 function in the human CNS, the basic neurobiology of TCF4 has been only sparsely studied. Thus, this Project will use genetically engineered mouse models to assess the role of TCF4 in memory, social interactions and communication, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, synaptic anatomy, and epigenomic and transcriptional regulation in the CNS. The central hypothesis of the proposed studies is that TCF4 regulates the brain's ability to trigger long-term synaptic plasticity and memory formation by actively regulating transcriptional activity in response to behavioral experience. The approach will be to use both germline constitutive knockout and acute knockdown or deletion of TCF4 in the adult mouse hippocampus, coupled with extensive behavioral, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic/epigenomic characterization, to determine if TCF4 function is necessary in an ongoing fashion for normal memory and synaptic plasticity in the mature CNS. The studies will capitalize not only upon the available germline knockout line but also upon an already-available floxed TCF4 allele mouse line, and combine these mice with both virus- driven cre expression in the adult hippocampus and post-developmental CaMKII promoter-driven forebrain neuron-selective cre expression to achieve inducible post-developmental attenuation of CNS TCF4 function in vivo. Using these novel mouse models we will undertake three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that TCF4-deficient mice exhibit cognitive memory and social interaction deficits, and also test the hypothesis that TCF4-deficient mice exhibit altered synaptic plasticity. Aim 2 will comprise a significant translational component of the studies and will test the hypothesis that transcription-promoting Histone DeAcetylase Inhibitors (HDACi) will restore learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity in TCF4-deficient mice, as proof-of- concept that behavioral deficits and plasticity deficits in PTHS model mice can be reversed pharmacologically with HDACi. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that loss of TCF4 function triggers secondary alterations in chromatin structure, DNA methylation, and gene transcription in the mature CNS. Toward this end, we will use the unbiased approach of utilizing MBD-seq, mRNA-seq, and small RNA-seq approaches for a comprehensive analysis of potential transcriptomic and epigenomic alterations in TCF4-deficient mice."

"9467584","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposes a program of tailored mentorship, focused research, didactics and coursework to provide the candidate with the training in sleep medicine and perinatal neuroendocrine functioning necessary for independence as an investigator.  Candidate. The candidate's background and foundation in clinical research make her well-poised for this award. She completed her Ph.D. in clinical psychology at the University of Alabama, where she received training rooted in the scientist-practitioner model. An emerging interest in sleep and mood led her to pursue a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Michigan, where she began to develop a niche in behavioral sleep medicine and perinatal mental health. She was recently appointed to the faculty of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Michigan. Her goal is to receive additional training in sleep medicine and perinatal neuroendocrinology. The candidate has identified two key training objectives necessary to achieve full independence as a researcher: (1) experience in sleep physiology (including assessment and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy) and (2) neuroendocrinology in pregnancy.  Environment. The proposed project will take place within the University of Michigan Department of Psychiatry and the Sleep Disorders Center. Both departments have an extensive history of close collaboration with the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The fifth largest research university in the United States, the University of Michigan provides extensive resources and a rich research environment. The candidate will have access to the large, accredited Sleep Laboratory within the Sleep Disorders Center, the well-established perinatal recruitment infrastructure within the Women's Mental Health and Infants Program (in collaboration with the Department of Obstetrics), and resources provided by the CTSA-funded Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research. The proposed primary mentor, Ronald Chervin, M.D., M.S., is a well-funded, highly productive expert in sleep-disordered breathing who has more than 20 years of experience in sleep medicine and a long history of mentoring K awardees and junior faculty. Two carefully selected co-mentors, physiologist Louise O'Brien, Ph.D., M.S., and psychiatrist Juan Lopez, M.D., will provide focused training in perinatal sleep and neuroendocrinology, respectively. The proposal is also bolstered by a tailored consultant team.  Research. The goal of this application is to understand the contribution of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) to one of the most common and debilitating adverse pregnancy outcomes, perinatal depression. It is our hypothesis that positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment of SDB in pregnant women with comorbid depression will result in significant reductions in depressive symptoms and improved neuroendocrine functioning. This proposal will leverage our unique expertise with PAP for SDB in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including perinatal depression. The rationale is that a better understanding of the role of SDB and the impact of PAP treatment on perinatal depression will allow for development of targeted and critically-timed interventions which may have long-term benefits for both women and their offspring. We plan to test our hypothesis by randomly assigning 50 women with SDB to receive either positive airway pressure treatment (PAP group) or treatment as usual in obstetrics (non-PAP group). The following specific aims will be tested: AIM 1: Determine the impact of PAP treatment on prenatal depressive symptoms in pregnant women with SDB and depression. AIM 2: Identify the contribution of PAP treatment on the HPA axis in pregnant women with SDB and depression. An exploratory aim is to assess associations between PAP treatment and adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in women with depression and SDB. With respect to expected outcomes, the proposed work will demonstrate that SDB during pregnancy plays a role in perinatal depression, and that treatment of SDB during pregnancy will ameliorate depressive symptoms and HPA axis functioning, and improve pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Such findings are expected to have an important positive impact, because they will further our understanding of the role of SDB in adverse pregnancy outcomes and reduce the burden of the most common and debilitating adverse outcomes experienced by pregnant women. This will have long term health benefits for both women and their offspring.  Summary. The proposed K23 will provide key additional training for a promising early investigator to become a clinical researcher in perinatal sleep medicine. The project will also address important, testable questions about the relationships between a common sleep disorder and the debilitating adverse pregnancy outcome of perinatal depression, a major public health concern."
"9535035","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT As the population ages, the incidence rate of Alzheimer?s Disease and Related Disorders (dementia) is expected to triple. Most persons with dementia (PWD) will be cared for in the community. However, the support and resources to ensure proper care is provided to PWD in the community is not currently present as noted in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer?s. One form of community-based care that is frequently provided to PWD in the community is home healthcare. While these clinicians often care for PWD, few agencies, or home health clinicians are appropriately prepared to provide palliative, symptom based, patient and family centered care for this vulnerable population. There are over 10,000 skilled home healthcare agencies providing care in almost every county across the United States. Thus, home healthcare is an untapped existing resource that could be utilized more effectively to improve the quality of care and quality of life for the PWD and their informal caregiver, reduce utilization, and decrease healthcare spending. The most concerning areas in need of improvement is in managing pain and behavioral and psychological disturbances (BPSD) in the PWD as they have significant effects on both PWD and caregiver quality of life, as well as on healthcare utilization. The Dementia Symptom Management at Home Program (DSM-H) is an interprofessional evidence-based multi- component intervention developed specifically for home healthcare agencies. It includes clinician training, mentorship and evidence-based assessment instruments, careplans and caregiver teaching sheets. The DSM- H has shown strong preliminary results, and therefore this study will perform a multi-site cluster randomized efficacy trial. The DSM-H will be randomly implemented in care teams at three diverse home healthcare agencies located in different regions of the United States. The aims of this trial are to: 1) Measure the effects of the DSM-H on quality of life and symptom severity in the PWD. 2) Assess the effects of the DSM-H on quality of life, and physical and mental health in the informal caregiver of the PWD. 3) Assess the effects of the DSM-H on healthcare utilization in the PWD. This study will recruit 460 PWD-informal caregiver dyads and each dyad will be assessed on admission, 15, 30 and 60 days post admission by an independent, blinded research assistant using standardized assessment instruments. We hypothesize that the DSM-H will improve quality of life of the PWD and caregiver, improve symptom management, and reduce utilization. While other interventions have focused on home-based models, no prior interventions have used both an interprofessional model and one where an existing, widespread, service model is used. This study is therefore significant and innovative as it will be the first to test the efficacy of a potentially widely disseminable and impactful evidence-based palliative and symptom management intervention for improving the quality of life for PWD and their informal caregivers receiving home healthcare."
"9654366","GEMSSTAR R03 Abstract Frailty is the occurrence of decreased reserve and functional decline with resultant vulnerability and poor outcomes in recovery from a stressor usually in older patients. Although frailty is distinct from age, it is highly correlated, and as the US population ages, the prevalence of frailty will likely increase. The growing prevalence of older patient population and frailty will place greater demands on surgical services. One third of all patients aged 65-85 will undergo a major surgical procedure within the last year of life. To provide the best quality of care, it is imperative that healthcare providers and hospitals develop strategies to meet these growing demands and to ensure higher-quality care for geriatric surgical patients. Recent data demonstrate that frailty is a powerful predictor of increased perioperative mortality, morbidity and cost in various surgical populations. Failure to rescue (FTR) refers to a failure to prevent death from treatable complications during hospitalization (e.g. major hemorrhage after surgery) and is used a metric for hospital quality. Our study aims to show that frailty impacts failure to rescue independent of other hospital factors. We also think that certain hospitals are better at rescuing frail patients and we aim to identify characteristics of such hospitals. Although intuitive, this association has not been studied so far. This will be the first study to examine the interplay of frailty, which is primarily a patient characteristic, and FTR- a quality indicator believed to hospital dependent. The proposal also entails a detailed professional development plan with training that will be essential both for successful completion of this research and toward Dr. Arya's career development and transition to aging and surgical quality research. Significant findings from this study will change the way failure to rescue research is used for hospital quality and will lay the groundwork for development of new interventions or protocols on a patient as well as hospital level to improve surgical outcomes in frail patients."
"9456596","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is increasing in incidence and poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. One quarter to one fifth of cases currently classified as PJI are microbiologically-negative using classic techniques and even in cases in which microbes are detected, our recent data shows that there are subpopulations of organisms present which are undetected using existing strategies. Further, differentiating infection from aseptic implant failure can be problematic. {Outside of mechanical reasons such as implant malposition, the cause of so-called aseptic implant failure is not well-defined and may be due by unrecognized infection with organisms that are nontraditional causes of PJI.}  Microorganisms associated with PJI are found in biofilms on the surface of the implant. We have developed a method that uses vortexing and sonication to sample the implant surface and have consistently shown that biofilm-containing material dislodged from the implant surface provides the ideal specimen for microbial detection, better than periprosthetic tissues and synovial fluid. Nevertheless, there remain many cases of culture-negative PJI. To address this issue, with support of R01 AR056647, we developed a panel of PCR assays targeting, at the genus-/group-level, the most common bacteria known to cause PJI. The sensitivity of the PCR panel was 77% whereas that of culture was 73% when performed on dislodged biofilm-containing material; specificities were 98% for both. {Based on these findings, we are evaluating/developing a rapid PCR panel strategy for intraoperative use.} Despite the improved sensitivity of the approach developed in our prior funding period, there remain PJI cases that test negative.  {In our renewal R01 application, we will focus on determining the etiology of culture- and panel PCR- negative PJI. We will also delineate subpopulations of same- and mixed-species biofilms associated with PJI, which our new preliminary data indicate are present and which may inform patient management, ensuring an ideal outcome. Finally, we will determine whether organisms not targeted by our PCR panel might account for what are currently classified as non-infectious arthroplasty failures unrelated to device failure.}  We propose to use deep sequencing technology which has emerged and matured since our original R01 project period. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches will be used to analyze host and microbial nucleic acids in biofilm-containing materials dislodged from the surfaces of orthopedic implants. Using deep sequencing, we will analyze microbial DNA and total expressed RNA, the latter separated into microbial and human RNA. We will test the hypothesis that the new deep sequencing approaches will detect PJI with improved clinical sensitivity compared to culture and panel PCR when applied to biofilm-containing materials dislodged from surfaces of orthopedic implants. We will also define the prevalence of previously undetected polymicrobial PJI, and assess for subpopulations of same-type bacteria, which our preliminary data suggest will be present, and which can impact treatment as well as inform pathogenesis. We will analyze human gene expression in material dislodged from explanted arthroplasties to test the hypothesis that there are PJI-specific human genomic expression signatures. {The cause of aseptic failure is in many cases incompletely defined; several lines of evidence suggest that cases not caused by device-related failure may be caused by bacteria. To address this, we will use metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches to study aseptic failure, separately analyzing failure due to particulate wear debris, implant malposition/structural device-related failure and more strictly classified aseptic failure.}  Beyond definition of the etiologies of PJI and aseptic failure, our results will inform development of new diagnostic assays for PJI targeting microbes directly and/or their associated host response and will provide targets for prevention (e.g., vaccination) and therapy (i.e., drug development) of PJI. In addition, we will determine whether some patients undergoing revision hip or knee arthroplasty for aseptic arthroplasty failure have previously unrecognized infection."
"9462006","Abstract Alcohol consumption is a critical predictor of poor HIV outcomes such as reduced antiretroviral adherence and lack of viral suppression. Reducing unhealthy alcohol use among those with HIV may improve HIV outcomes and thus is a high priority. HIV prevalence and unhealthy drinking rates are high in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Multi-session approaches to screening and brief counseling have good evidence for reducing alcohol use in resource rich settings and in persons with HIV. However, multiple in-person sessions are costly and unlikely to be scalable in SSA. Thus, there is a need to develop and test low-cost alternatives. A successful multi-contact alcohol intervention studied in the US uses phone-based booster sessions with a live counselor (?live boosters?) to reinforce the content of two brief in-person sessions. Because cell phone coverage is widespread in SSA, an intervention that uses live boosters may be feasible, particularly if the in-person sessions coincide with regular clinic visits. However, live booster calls can be labor intensive and dependent on a good phone network. Alternatively, automated booster sessions can be conducted via cell phone using short message service (SMS, i.e. text) or interactive voice response (IVR) systems, to provide brief 2-way interactive sessions (?tech boosters?). These systems are likely to be at low cost and burden to providers and patients. The SMS/IVR systems allow for tailoring the 2-way booster sessions on variables such as gender and drinking goals. The primary aims of this developmental study are (1) To adapt a successful alcohol intervention for unhealthy drinkers with HIV in Uganda to include in-person sessions that coincide with two routine quarterly clinic visits, with live booster calls delivered between in-person sessions, and to develop tech boosters as a scalable alternative to live calls. We will collect qualitative data via focus group discussions and individual in- depth interviews to elicit community and patient input into the content and delivery of the interventions. (2) To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test these methods for unhealthy drinkers in HIV care in rural Uganda (n=270). The study arms will be: (a) in-person counseling during 2 quarterly clinic visits plus live booster calls every 3 weeks in the interim, (b) in-person counseling during 2 quarterly clinic visits plus twice weekly tech (choice of SMS or IVR) boosters in the interim, and (c) standard of care control (brief unstructured advice, with a wait-listed intervention). We will obtain preliminary estimates of uptake, acceptability, cost, and efficacy in reducing alcohol use and decreasing viral failure for each study arm at six months. We will utilize an alcohol biomarker, phosphatidylethanol, in addition to self-reported alcohol use, and measure viral suppression via dried blood spots. This study will be conducted in a large rural Ugandan HIV clinic where we have 10 years of collaborating on alcohol/HIV research. The study will adapt a successful intervention and develop low-cost delivery methods, and the pilot RCT results will inform the design of a larger trial of a low-cost intervention to reduce alcohol use and increase viral suppression among those with HIV in SSA."
"9569059","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plasmodium species, the etiologic agents of malaria, kill nearly 1 million people annually. They initially infect the liver as sporozoites, then they replicate as liver stages within hepatocytes to generate exoerythrocytic merozoites that initiate symptomatic blood stage infection. These preerythrocytic stages of infection are clinically silent and were thought to not provoke a significant innate immune response. Yet, recent findings from our group and collaborators have shown that preerythrocytic stages induce a pronounced innate immune response in the liver. The mechanisms by which these complex parasites induce an innate immune response and the downstream effects of these responses on parasite infection remain poorly defined. Understanding the innate immune response to this eukaryotic, intracellular pathogen is important in its own right but also a critical missing piece in the puzzl to understand the development of sterilizing adaptive immunity engendered by whole parasite immunizations. Therefore, we propose to identify which innate immune responses are activated by wild-type and attenuated Plasmodium preerythrocytic parasites and to determine how these innate immune responses influence protective adaptive immune responses. Using gene expression analysis and functional assays, we have shown that liver stage infection induces an innate immune response mediated by type I and type II interferon (IFN) signaling pathways. We have also shown that lymphocytes infiltrate the liver within days following infection and that this infiltration is strongly dependent on type I IFN (IFN-1) signaling. Furthermore, this innate response reduces the initial infection. These results indicate a link between IFN-1, lymphocyte recruitment, and subsequent innate parasite elimination. Our preliminary data also shows that this IFN-1 driven innate response shapes the adaptive immune response that is engendered by whole parasite immunizations. This we demonstrate with mice deficient in key IFN-1 signaling molecules, which surprisingly, are better protected by whole parasite immunizations. In this proposal, we intend to further delineate the generation and consequences of an IFN-mediated innate immune response to Plasmodium liver infection. In Aim 1 we will identify the host-parasite interactions that initiate this IFN-mediated innate immune response and identify the cell types in the liver that respond to IFN. In Aim 2 we will characterize cell-specific responses withi the liver following infection and identify cytokine and chemokine receptors that are necessary for innate lymphocyte infiltration. Additionally, we will evaluate the cellular mechanisms by which these innate cells eliminate liver stage parasites. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate how IFN-1-mediated signaling influences the development of adaptive immune responses engendered by whole parasite immunizations. Understanding the nature of the early innate immune response will reveal how a complex eukaryotic parasite engages early host immune defenses. Equally important, it will also identify innate molecular pathways to target for improvement of adaptive immune responses after vaccination that aims to protect against malaria infection."

Research collaborations are facilitated through disease- and modality-specific research teams that meet regularly, including leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, transplant, immunotherapy, and gene therapy. Each of these teams works in an integrated manner and includes multi-disciplinary collaborators from the HM Program as well as from other Cancer Center programs and cores. The Themes of our program are the following: Theme 1: Identify key biological pathways and targeting strategies for hematologic malignancies. Theme 2: Develop novel therapeutic approaches for early-phase clinical testing. Theme 3: Advance translational research in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and adoptive  cellular immunotherapy (ACIT). The HM Program improves public health both through its refinement of currently available treatment options for hematological malignancies and its advancement of novel therapies to the clinic, via an intensive Phase I/II investigational drug program. We are exploring multiple avenues of treatment ? chemotherapy, immunotherapy, gene therapy, targeted therapy, chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy and HCT ? to improve patient cure rates and treatment tolerability throughout the disease course.

"9605501","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Approximately 1/3 of people living with epilepsy (PWE) continue to have seizures despite anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Recent trials using therapeutic brain stimulation show reductions in seizures, but rarely provide seizure free outcomes. Although seizures occupy a small fraction of their life, as little as 0.01%, PWE take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively managed, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with accurate seizure diaries, real-time seizure forecasting, and responsive stimulation for brain state modulation. With accurate seizure forecasting patients would be empowered to manage their life activities. The optimal epilepsy management device requires: 1) Automated seizure detection 2) Accurate Automated Electronic Seizure Diaries 3) Seizure Forecasting and 4) Programmable Brain Stimulation. In this grant we develop an epilepsy management and therapy platform using Medtronic's 3rd generation device implantable device. The RC+S provides chronic nervous system sensing and analytics using embedded scientific instrumentation (e.g. - sensors, classification, and control policy implementation), and provides a unique opportunity for exploring and managing epileptic neural networks."
"9462924","PROJECT SUMMARY This project investigates the unique and joint impact of tau and amyloid pathology associated with Alzheimer's disease and of white matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin on brain network function and cognition, including memory and executive abilities. The overarching hypothesis is that tau, amyloid, and white matter burden interact to specifically disrupt the function of brain networks in which the burden occurs, and will lead to declines in cognitive abilities associated with the disrupted networks. The proposed work builds on recent advances in the connectomics of functional networks within individuals using magnetic resonance imaging and a recently-developed positron emission tomography marker for the visualization of tau burden in humans. The first specific aim tests for differential and interactive influences of tau, amyloid and white matter burden when these pathological markers occur within a brain network. The second specific aim tests for how interactions between tau, amyloid, and white matter burden may lead to declines in cognition over a 3-year period. The proposed work provides novel extensions of recent cross-sectional findings relating network function, pathology, and cognition to critically test whether tau and amyloid burden interact with white matter burden to impact regional network integrity and cognition during the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease. If successful, these aims will provide evidence that localized preclinical tau and amyloid pathology and white matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin have an interactive impact that contributes to the functional network and cognitive declines commonly observed during aging. This work will help to differentiate processes attributed to typical aging and development from the pathology associated with Alzheimer's disease at its earliest stages. If successful, this work will improve our understanding of how the location of pathology impacts specific brain networks and cognitive abilities, and will provide measures to improve early diagnosis of network or cognitive dysfunction attributable to the location of these pathological markers in individual patients."
"9509539","Depression is a debilitating disease that can dramatically affect a person's health and life. People suffering from depression experience extended periods of sadness, despair, reduced motivation and hopelessness, and they are often unable to enjoy activities once found pleasurable. At present, effective treatments for depression and other dysfunctional emotional states remain elusive. Traditional treatment perspectives have conceptualized depression as a dysfunction of specific monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems. Recently, more nuanced conceptual frameworks have arisen as a result of efforts to correlate disease symptoms with dysfunction of specific brain networks mediating mood and reward responses. The lateral habenula (LHb), a part of the reward circuit that provides ?negative value? to midbrain dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), has emerged as a key brain region for the pathophysiology of depression. LHb neurons projecting to the VTA are hyperactive in an animal model of depression, and reducing synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons through deep brain stimulation can ameliorate depression-related behaviors. However, the identities of afferent pathways that drive hyperactivity of these neurons are largely unknown. Here, we propose an innovative experimental strategy that employs a combination of state-of-the-art methods, including novel molecular and genetic tools, electrophysiology, optogenetics and behavioral paradigms to investigate how chronic stress, an important cause for depression in humans, alters synaptic transmission in specific LHb afferent pathways. Our goals are to (1) identify precisely which LHb pathways are altered following chronic stress exposure, (2) describe the underlying synaptic mechanisms and (3) develop circuit-specific strategies to reverse chronic stress-induced behavioral changes. Linking chronic stress-induced synaptic adaptations to relevant LHb pathways will provide important insights into how the brain processes chronic stress in order to generate maladaptive behavioral responses, which may inspire novel treatment strategies that involve reprogramming of specific brain circuits for treating depression."
"9386774","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project examines the inhibitory neural circuitry of the CA2 region of the hippocampus and its role in neuropsychiatric disorders, focusing on neurodevelopmental disease including schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The motivation for this proposal comes from two independent findings. First, we have recently found that CA2 is crucial for social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize a conspecific. Given the altered social behaviors characteristic of SCZ and ASD, we postulated that pathological changes in CA2 function might be contributing factors. Indeed, two independent studies on the brains of individuals with SCZ and bipolar disorder have found a significant loss in the number of parvalbumin positive (PV+) inhibitory neurons in the CA2 region of the hippocampus, but not in neighboring hippocampal regions (CA1 and CA3). To examine the possible role of CA2 in SCZ, we examined a mouse model (Df(16)A+/- mice) of the human 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder that provides one of the strongest known genetic links with SCZ. Individuals harboring this deletion also display a number of autistic-like changes in social behaviors. The Df(16)A+/- mice were shown to have a number of cognitive changes associated with SCZ, including altered prepulse inhibition and contextual and working memory. Our preliminary results demonstrate that these mice also have a profound deficit in social memory. Remarkably, we find that the Df(16)A+/- mice show a specific reduction in PV+ inhibitory neurons in CA2, but no change in CA1 or CA3, identical to the results in human neuropsychiatric disorders. Moreover, the loss of inhibition in mice is first seen in late adolescence to early adulthood, similar to the developmental onset of SCZ. Here we will expand upon these initial findings by examining the importance of CA2 in the behavioral phenotypes of the Df(16)A+/- mice. We will first explore in more detail the function of CA2 inhibitory neurons that are targeted by the deletion mutation. We will also probe more deeply the behavioral changes in the Df(16)A+/- mice and ask whether we can rescue the behavioral changes by either silencing or activating CA2 in these animals. Thus the experiments we propose will both provide new insight into the neural circuitry and function of inhibition in the underexplored CA2 region of the hippocampus and will help determine the potential role of altered CA2 function in a mouse model of SCZ. These experiments offer the possibility of identifying new targets for treating disease, particularly as CA2 PNs display a unique pattern of gene expression not seen in other hippocampal areas. Given the changes in social behavior associated with other neuropsychiatric disorders, including ASD, our experiments may also provide general insights into basic brain mechanisms contributing to a variety of disorders of social behavior."
"9425160","PROJECT SUMMARY Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the single most important infection leading to transplant failure and continues to be a cause of substantial morbidity and death. Indeed, HCMV disease occurs in 20-30% of transplants at risk for infection and is a particular problem to lung or heart-lung recipients with a reported incidence of 50-80%. Clinical manifestations of HCMV are widespread, inflammatory in nature, and dependent on end-organ dysfunction. Inflammatory organ diseases associated with a HCMV infection is a direct consequence of the systemic viral spread to and infection of multiple organ sites that occur during either asymptomatic or symptomatic infections. Monocytes are responsible for delivering the virus into tissue and play a central role in the inflammatory state of infected organs. Since therapies against HCMV are designed to block specific steps along the virus replication cycle, the lack of HCMV replication in infected blood monocytes indicates that HCMV antiviral drugs are not effective in preventing the initial spread of the virus. In accord, prophylaxis has simply shifted the kinetics of HCMV disease to later after transplantation due to the inability of antiviral drugs to eliminate infiltrating infected inflammatory myeloid cells, which are the principle cell type found in infected organs of transplant patients. Thus, we advocate that the suppression of HCMV replication with prophylactic antiviral drugs must be administered in combination with novel drugs specifically capable of killing infected monocytes. We have found that HCMV explicitly utilizes cellular Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, to stimulate the survival of infected monocytes. Using a high- throughput screening approach, Dr. Nikolovska-Coleska?s laboratory has synthesized and characterized two novel classes of highly selective Mcl-1 antagonists. We have tested one lead compound from each class of inhibitor and demonstrated both to have high killing activity towards HCMV-infected monocytes. Furthermore, we were able to significantly enhance the selectivity and killing activity of each compound by encapsulation into nanoparticles developed in Dr. Luo?s laboratory. Thus, we hypothesize that Mcl-1 inhibitors will target HCMV- infected monocytes to prevent hematogenous dissemination, which will be tested in 3 separate aims. Aim 1 will further evaluate the two library classes of Mcl-1 small-molecule inhibitors to identify compounds exhibiting maximum cytotoxicity against HCMV-infected monocytes. Medicinal chemistry will also be preformed to increase the potency of compounds. Aim 2 will be to further develop and characterize nanoparticle technology to enhance targeting of Mcl-1 inhibitors towards infected monocytes. Aim 3 will determine the efficacy of free versus encapsulated Mcl-1 small-molecule inhibitors at neutralizing/limiting HCMV spread in a humanized mouse model. These studies will evaluate the use of Mcl-1 inhibitors as an antiviral strategy to target infected cells rather than the virus directly, which could have major impact on the prognosis of transplant patients at high-risk for HCMV infection."

"9463783","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma Action at Erie Trial Asthma prevalence and morbidity has been increasing among children over the last three decades despite significant advances in environmental control and asthma care. The annual costs for children with asthma range between $2.0 and $3.2 billion. Asthma morbidity and its associated costs are not borne equally; they are highest for urban, low income, African American and Puerto Rican children. Community health workers (CHWs) have been growing in popularity as a potential intervention to combat these asthma disparities. CHWs are frontline public health workers who serve as liaisons between health and social services and communities to facilitate access to services and improve the quality and cultural competence of service delivery. The evidence on CHW asthma intervention efficacy has been growing but several critical gaps still exist. The Asthma Action at Erie Trial will test the ability of a CHW intervention with three important modifications to achiev asthma control in high-risk children: 1) CHWs will be integrated into both the clinical and the home setting, 2) A system for directly addressing mental health and psychosocial barriers will be provided, and 3) Participants will be provided only materials and equipment for trigger remediation that are supported by the current medical reimbursement system. A two-arm behavioral randomized controlled trial (N=220) will be conducted in partnership with a federally- qualified health center (FQHC) serving a low income, minority population that is at high-risk for significant asthma morbidity. The intervention arm will receive an integrated CHW home intervention for pediatric asthma education. The comparison arm will received clinic-based certified asthma educator (AE-C) services. Primary Aim 1 is to assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention, relative to clinic-based AE-C education over 12-months, as demonstrated by asthma control. We hypothesize that the CHW arm will have at least 30% fewer days with activity limitation than the AE-C arm at 12-months. Specific Aim 2 is to assess maintenance of intervention efficacy, as demonstrated by asthma control at 18 and 24 months after randomization. Specific Aim 3 is to determine the cost-effectiveness at 12-months of CHW and AE-C intervention delivery, and additional costs or savings related to asthma exacerbations at 12- and 24-months. Specific Aim 4 is to assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention relative to clinic- based AE-C education, as demonstrated by asthma control, among those experiencing depression, stress, and/or a post-traumatic stress disorder. This trial compares the current best practice in asthma self- management education (AE-C services) to an integrated CHW home intervention in which the real-life challenges of patients and the health care system are taken fully into account. This trial will provide clarity a to the expected effect size, cost savings, and resources needed to integrate asthma CHWs into clinical practice. ."
"9538827","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a common, lifelong, disabling disorder with unsatisfactory treatment, motivating research into its causation and pathogenesis. The heritability of SCZ is estimated at over 70%, yet recent GWAS mega analyses have explained a relatively small fraction of the heritability. Another portion of the heritability is lkely due to rare loci. Although by definition the rare loci may affect risk in only a small number of individuals, investigations of diseases such as familial hypercholesterolemia show that the rare loci can potentially teach us much about the etiology of disease and even indicate new avenues of treatment. Recent publications support this contention. We propose to identify rare SCZ loci with large effects through highly selected extended pedigrees. We will leverage resources from an ongoing NIH funded Multiplex- Multigenerational Genetic Investigation (MGI). Over the past ten years, through a three- site collaboration, we have identified, intensively characterized and investigated over 43 multiplex, multigenerational SCZ pedigrees and community controls. MGI has a wealth of phenotypic data, including gene expression, structural and functional brain imaging, and neurocognitive performance measures, as well as standard clinical symptom, diagnostic and functional information on participants. From this sample, we have identified four extended families, each with three or more individuals with SCZ and an unusually high number of additional family members with non-SCZ Axis I diagnoses. We aim to identify rare SCZ risk variants in these families using an efficient and cost effective strategy that combines novel founder-specific linkage analyses, whole genome sequencing of selected individuals and panels of selected SNPs. Using the available extensive quantitative data, we will investigate the expression of the risk loci beyond affection status and take a dimensional approach to vulnerability and severity. We will also investigate the expression of the rare variants in neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells. By investigating a range of highly relevant phenotypes, our proposal aims to go beyond disease gene mapping to initiate an understanding of SCZ pathogenesis. Our consortium brings expertise in SCZ, neurobiology, neurocognition, neuroimaging, and genetics to this effort. We have made all existing tissue samples and data available to the scientific community and will continue to do so."
"9452975","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will investigate the inputs and physiology of premotor neurons controlling the near triad actions of vergence, lens accommodation and pupillary constriction; critical actions in the etiology of strabismus and amblyopia. It will: 1. provide the first detailed anatomical demonstration of the circuits underlying vergence functions; 2. characterize the function and connections of a novel set of near triad premotor neurons, and 3. test competing current models of eye movement control. The results will confer a better understanding of the mechanisms for obtaining stereoscopic vision. Two opposing models of eye movement control in 3-D space provide the context. One traces its lineage to Hering, who believed that conjugate and vergence eye movement signals were added together at the level of the motoneuron. The other traces its heritage to Helmhotz, who believed that the movement of each eye is independently controlled, and that conjugate and vergence movements represent learned patterns of volitional coordination. We will characterize the physiological responses and determine the inputs to two populations of neurons: perioculomotor vergence cells believed to lie in the supraoculomotor area (SOA) and a newly discovered set of premotor neurons located in the central mesencephalic reticular formation (cMRF). These two populations contact the preganglionic motoneurons in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EWpg) that control the lens and pupil, and medial rectus motoneurons active in vergence, indicating a function in near triad control. The study will determine whether the perioculomotor vergence cells and/or premotor cMRF neurons are targeted by the caudal, saccade-related component of the colliculus, the rostral colliculus, which contains cells active during fixation and vergence, or the frontal eye fields (FEF) vergence zone. The 5 inter-related aims carried out in macaque monkeys utilize physiological recording in awake behaving animals, conventional neuronal tracers and transneuronal transport of conventional and recombinant viruses. Aim 1 will compare the precise anatomical location of perioculomotor vergence cells and premotor cMRF neurons. Aim 2 will test the Hering and Helmhotz models by using transneuronal tracing to determine whether these two populations or premotor neurons in the pons are anatomically eye- specific. Aim 3 recordings will test the hypothesis that only the premotor cMRF neurons control the near triad during disjunctive saccades. Aim 4 will examine whether the pattern of tectal projections to these two populations supports such a functional division. Aim 5 will combine physiological and anatomical approaches to ask the same question about FEF inputs. The dramatically augmented understanding of eye movement control circuits and cell function afforded by this project will provide a critical basis for improved concepts of eye movement control and coordination in health and disease."
"9444422","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rate of bone repair slows with aging, and little is known about the mechanisms responsible for this delayed repair process. The slow healing is responsible for increased morbidity and even mortality when older adults sustain a fracture. During fracture repair, undifferentiated mesenchymal cells accumulate and differentiate to osteoblasts to reestablish the mechanical properties of bone. We discovered that ?-catenin needs to be precisely regulated for normal fracture repair, and both up and down regulation inhibit the ability of cells to become osteoblasts. ?-catenin protein level was substantially increased during fracture repair with aging, and this was associated with an inhibition of undifferentiated cells to become osteoblasts. Furthermore, we found that hematopoetic cells from young mice could suppress ?-catenin and rejuvenate repair. Here we will use heterochronic parabiosis experiments, in which young and old mice share a blood supply, and bone marrow transplantation experiments to identify the cell type responsible for the rejuvenation effect. Furthermore, we will study the role of secreted factors produced by young hematopoetic cells, that we identified using mass spectroscopy, in bone repair in aging using genetically modified mice. This work will identify novel potential therapies to improve fracture repair in aging, ultimately reducing the morbidity associated with injury in older individuals."
"9449388","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insomnia is a significant public health problem for older adults with substantial medical, psychological and financial ramifications. With as many as 20-30% of older adults (age =55) meeting diagnostic criteria for chronic insomnia, finding accessible, effective, and low-cost treatments is critical. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is a non-pharmacological intervention that has been shown to be efficacious when tailored for older adults. Regrettably, access to this treatment is significantly limited by a lack of trained clinicians and expense. To overcome barriers to face-to-face care, use of the Internet has emerged as a feasible and effective method to provide health information and treatment. Unfortunately, the health care field has been reluctant to use technology-delivered solutions with older patients out of a concern that older adults either do not have access to or do not want to use technology. However, older adults in the U.S. are the largest growing group of Internet users, and they generally have a desire to learn new technologies. When older adults do use technology-based programs for health promotion, they rate these programs favorably. Internet-delivered CBT-I for older adults has a high likelihood of major public health impact by allowing wide- spread access to a needed intervention, increasing the convenience of obtaining care, and decreasing treatment costs among an age group with high rates of insomnia known to exacerbate other concerns (health, mood, cognition). Our research team previously developed and tested an Internet-delivered, automated intervention based on the primary tenants of CBT-I for adults under 65 (SHUTi: Sleep Healthy Using The Internet, R34MH70805 and R01MH086758). Pilot data with a subset of users aged 55-65 indicates that the Internet intervention is feasible and efficacious in this age group; however, this age group differs from the younger cohort in terms of greater dropout and smaller magnitude of improvement (although still significant). The primary goal of this grant is to conduct the first RCT of an Internet intervention tailored for older adults with insomnia (OAWI). We will recruit 309 OAWI in a 3 (Patient Education (PE) website vs. SHUTi for Older Adults vs. SHUTi-OA + Stepped Care (SC)) X 4 (Pre, Post, 6 and 12 month follow-up) design. We hypothesize that adults who receive SHUTi-OA (or SHUTi-OA+SC) will show greater improvements in sleep and daytime variables compared to those in the PE website. We also expect that SHUT-OA+SC (provision of personalized emails or phone calls to participants not completing assigned tasks) will result in greater utilization and better outcomes than SHUTi-OA without support, but at increased cost. Cost-effectiveness analyses and acceptability curves will determine the incremental benefit achieved with the additional costs. If the Internet intervention proves efficacious in a large RCT, it would yield an effective, relatively low-cost, and readily scalable insomnia solution for the fastest-growing demographic in the U.S. (older adults) who experiences the greatest rates of insomnia."

"9539931","PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate and career goals: My overall career goal is to become an independent physician-scientist conducting interdisciplinary, patient-centered clinical research to improve sexual function in aging women. This K23 Career Development Award will provide me with the additional experience and skills to reach this goal. I have a long-standing passion for women's health and interdisciplinary investigation, and additional training in behavioral clinical trials, the psychological and physiologic aspects of female sexual function, and advanced research methods in geriatric women's health will ensure my successful transition to independence. Training will include didactic coursework, national workshops, society meetings, one-on-one mentored tutorials, and participation in seminars. My interdisciplinary mentoring team includes Dr. Thurston (primary mentor, women's health and aging), Dr. Resnick (geriatric women's health, behavioral trials), Dr. Borrero (qualitative research, career mentorship), and Dr. Brotto (mindfulness, sexual function). In addition, I will be supported by the University of Pittsburgh, a major academic medical center with a long history of high quality research. Currently ranked 5th in the nation in NIH funding, the University comprises a wealth of research and training resources to enable me to meet my goals. Research plan: Almost half of U.S. women experience sexual problems, which have significant negative impacts on physical and mental health. Low sexual desire is the most common sexual problem, particularly among women 50 and older, but there are few treatment options available. Treatments that can address both physical and psychological aspects of sexual dysfunction may be more effective than medications. Mindfulness is a practice that emphasizes in-the-moment focus and non-judgmental bodily awareness. A group-based behavioral intervention rooted in mindfulness has shown early promise in small trials, but only among younger women. The overall objective of this study is to adapt and pilot test a mindfulness intervention in women 50 and older with low sexual desire. In phase one, data from qualitative research among older women will be used by the primary investigator and a stakeholder advisory to adapt an existing mindfulness intervention. In phase 2, fifty women will be randomized to the adapted intervention or an educational control group on general health and aging. Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, as well as changes sexual desire, function, and satisfaction, will be assessed. Findings from this study will be used to design a larger efficacy trial to test the adapted intervention. The proposed award is consistent with the mission of the NIA to support research using ?integrative approaches to the study of social, psychological, and physiological influences on health and well- being over the life course.? Developing effective treatments for women's sexual problems will not only improve women's sex lives. It will address a significant public health need by allowing adults to maintain high quality of life and essential social relationships with aging."
"9521619","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Smoking is the leading preventable cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, each year contributing to approximately 443,000 deaths. Smoking and high relapse rates are likely due to factors that affect both limbic and executive circuits in the brain, including vulnerability to salient smoking-related cues and loss of cognitive control. Accumulating evidence indicates that in addiction, the frontal-striatal circuits involved in limbic reward and impulsive action are relatively hyperactive, while the executive control circuits are relatively hypoactive. Thus, intervention efforts should be directed at either decreasing the relative activity of the impulsive reward circuit or increasing the relative activity of the executive control circuits. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive, FDA-approved treatment for depression which is also being investigated for as a possible treatment for smoking cessation. The goal of this project is to use the novel theta burst stimulation (TBS) protocol to induce sustainable decreases and increases in the impulsive and executive control circuits, respectively. To do so, we will apply an attenuating form of TBS to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex to target the impulsive reward circuit and a potentiating form of TBS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to target the executive control circuit. We will then investigate the efficacy of these protocols for reducing a range of smoking measures, including cigarette valuation, delay discounting, cigarette self-administration, and brain reactivity to smoking cues. The results from these investigations will pave a clear pathway for the systematic development of neural-circuit based strategies as treatments for tobacco use and dependence."
"9491624","Analytical Cytometry Core Shared Resource ABSTRACT To advance our understanding of cancer etiology and to develop improved therapeutic approaches, it is critical for researchers to have the ability to routinely analyze and isolate discrete cell types from complex heterogeneous populations. The Analytical Cytometry Core (ACC) fulfills this vital function for CC members by providing services to define and isolate discrete immune system cells and cancer cells based on cell surface markers, to quantify and isolate cells that express fluorescent markers, and to examine discrete cell growth states. The ACC provides flow cytometry analysis and sorting instrumentation (ten analyzers, four sorters) to support the research goals of the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (COHCCC). The ACC maintains several analysis instruments (BC Gallios, BC CyAn, BD C6, and two BD Fortessas) that enable varying degrees of parameter detection in the Furth building on the COH main campus. These instruments can be operated either by researchers or by core staff. A small particle analyzer (e.g., exosome and nanoparticle; NanoSight NS300) is also available at this location. Additional analyzers are available throughout the main campus and the City of Hope Biomedical Research Center (BC Gallios, two BD C6, BD Fortessa, and BD Fortessa X-20). Three high-parameter cell sorting instruments (BD Aria sorters), located on the main campus and the City of Hope Biomedical Research Center, are maintained and operated by core staff. An additional simple cell sorter (Bio- Rad S3), located on the main campus, is available for operation by individual researchers. Several additional instruments are on order with scheduled delivery in July 2017: a BD Fortessa X-20, a BD Aria Fusion sorter, and a state-of-the-art high-dimensional cytometer (BD FACSymphony). The core is directed by Dr. Jeremy Stark, a Professor in the Department of Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, and supported by highly qualified staff that maintain and operate the equipment while also providing training to COHCCC researchers who wish to operate ACC instruments independently. Trained and authorized users have 24/7 access to the instrumentation, and core staff schedules are staggered to allow for an extended workday for core-assisted operation. Oversight is provided by an interdisciplinary faculty Advisory Committee, and user feedback through an annual survey. Over the past five years, the ACC was used by 142 unique investigators, including 94 CC members. Of the 94 CC members, 79 (84%) had peer-reviewed funding. Usage included members from all five Programs. Thus, the ACC provides accessible, cost-effective, and high quality flow cytometry services to support the research of the COHCCC."
"9458080","PROJECT SUMMARY  Unprecedented growth in the proportion of older adults in the U.S. has placed inequalities in healthy aging at the forefront of the public health agenda. Individuals often differ dramatically in their speed of aging. Some demonstrate accelerated aging and suffer early onset of chronic illness whereas others manifest decelerated aging and stave off serious illness well into their 90s. In recent years, researchers have made much headway in understanding the molecular markers of healthy aging, thereby allowing for earlier identification of risk for chronic disease. The proposed research focuses on two such biomarkers of healthy aging ? inflammatory aging and methylomic aging. These measures provide us with ?biological clocks? that are strongly predictive of age-related physiological decline, disease, and mortality. Having established these molecular measures of the speed of aging, the important question for social scientists and health policy now becomes: To what extent is the speed of aging malleable, for better or worse, in response to natural shifts in psychosocial contexts? This question is the focus of the present proposal. We plan to investigate the extent to which adult social conditions from various domains, but especially those operating within the family, influence speed of biological aging after taking into account childhood experiences and potentially confounding life style factors such as diet, exercise, and smoking. Our objective is to identify the stressors that accelerate aging as well as the supports that decelerate aging. These goals will be pursued using longitudinal data from the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS), a 20-year study of well-being among African American mothers, their romantic partners (RPs), and their offspring. A focus on aging among African Americans is important as they tend to suffer from earlier onset and higher prevalence of age-related diseases and a wider range of psychosocial stressors than other ethnic groups. First, we will obtain longitudinal indices of the speed of inflammatory and methylomic aging from the now middle-aged mothers and, if partnered, their RPs by collecting and assaying a new wave of blood data, as well as assaying stored blood from a previous wave. The proposed data will provide the first comprehensive assessment of change in the speed or rate of biological aging during adulthood. Second, we will collect an additional wave of interview data so that changes in supports and stressors can be mapped onto changes in the rate of biological aging."
"9479716","ABSTRACT This TL1 Training Core, in support of the UTMB CTSA U54 application, will provide ?predoctoral students (3 trainees/year) with a deep orientation to translational science, and postdoctoral fellows (3 scholars/year) with advanced research training aligned with the CTSA's goals of advancing therapeutics (drugs, devices, diagnostics and preventatives), clinical interventions, and behavioral modifications to improve human health.? Existing curricula and training programs at UTMB, as elsewhere, excel at developing discipline-specific knowledge and technical skills, but are less effective at developing the core skills and competencies essential for the effective and efficient practice of team-based translational science; these are: team management, shared leadership, conflict resolution and negotiations, interprofessional communication, entrepreneurship, and the regulatory and ethical issues associated with human subjects research and clinical trials. To address this gap, we will build on our CTSA hub's successful application of a hybrid industry ?work team?-academic approach to translational research using a Multidisciplinary Translational Team (MTT) model. We will also use a training model that is based on our successful implementation of a competency-driven curriculum for a new translational PhD program. We will recruit from a sufficiently large pool of trainees in any of our 13 biomedical graduate programs, including a large proportion of underrepresented minorities, which is mirrored by a diverse faculty. Of key importance, the GSBS and the UTMB Provost initiated and fund financial supplements for students recruited as Presidential Scholars to encourage the enrollment of outstanding graduate students. Potential trainees will be advised to pursue laboratory rotations with MTT-based faculty. Once a mentoring team is selected, students and their mentors will apply for training positions (predoctoral fellowship) in the TL1 Training Core. Postdoctoral scholars will be specifically recruited to the program by MTT-based mentors (Program Faculty). Among others, three particularly innovative components of the required curriculum include: 1) the Interprofessional Translational Research Design Course, which includes medical students and PhD students working in teams; 2) the Clinical Encounters Program, which addresses the need for trainees and scholars to be educated in the human health- and disease-related aspects of their research; and 3) dissertation/postdoctoral research projects co-mentored by both scientific and clinical experts. Lastly, our training program's evaluations will use relevant, validated assessment tools such as the Teamwork Competency Test and others. Primary financial resources, space, and staff are committed by UTMB to provide oversight, key core resources, integrative programs and seminars for this Training Core. The Graduate School of Basic Sciences also provides financial and infrastructure support for the Training Core. Lastly, the supporting letter from the UTMB Provost enumerates the current and future commitments to the ITS, which assure the success of this oversight entity for our innovative training program."
"9504542","Project Background: Over the past decade, opioid use and injection drug use, particularly heroin injection, have increased across most US demographic groups, making opioid-use-related mortality and morbidity a public health crisis both for Veterans and non-Veterans. Morbidity from opioid use is broad, including acquisition of HIV and HCV, which spread efficiently through the transfer of blood in shared injecting equipment. Interventions to prevent morbidity from opioid use disorder include opioid agonist therapy, psychosocial interventions, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, clean needle programs, and enhanced testing for blood-borne diseases, but the cost effectiveness of these interventions in VA has not been determined. In prior work, we have evaluated the cost effectiveness of interventions to prevent HIV for people who inject drugs in non-Veteran populations and found some to be very expensive. Project Objectives: This study will assess health outcomes, costs, cost effectiveness, and budget impact of interventions to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with opioid use disorder. The analysis will assess the cost effectiveness of interventions used individually or in combination when applied to populations of Veterans. Project Methods: To accomplish our objectives we will develop cost effectiveness models that assess health outcomes, cost, cost effectiveness, and budget impact of interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality from opioid use disorders. We will extend models that we have developed previously to reflect the costs and population characteristics of Veterans. Our analyses will include opioid agonist therapy, psychosocial interventions, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, use of naloxone, intensive screening for HIV and HCV, and other opioid use disorder treatments. To develop parameter estimates of effectiveness and harms of interventions, we will systematically review studies of interventions and assess study design, study quality, consistency, and applicability to Veteran populations. We will also assess whether comorbid conditions and receipt of social services affects the effectiveness of opioid use disorder treatment. To estimate costs of interventions we will use both literature-based estimates for interventions that VA has not provided and VA costs where available and appropriate. Our analyses will estimate both cost effectiveness and budget impact. Cost effectiveness is determined by the incremental benefit of an intervention compared to the next best alternative intervention divided by the incremental costs. Single interventions are unlikely to provide the same degree of benefit as combined interventions. However, how cost effectiveness varies for multiple interventions requires careful analyses because interventions may be synergistic or duplicative. Our analyses will account for these interdependencies. Our analyses will estimate deaths averted, adverse events from treatment, life years gained, quality-adjusted life years gained, cases of HIV or HCV averted (where appropriate), costs, and incremental cost effectiveness. Cost effectiveness provides insight into value and efficiency. However, even programs that are cost effective may require large total investments. Therefore, we will also estimate the budget impact of programs singly or in a portfolio. Budget impact captures the total expenditures that are required for implementation of programs at various levels of coverage or scale up. The study will provide an understanding of which interventions or combinations of interventions are likely to most improve the health of Veterans with opioid use disorder, along with estimates of the efficiency and total costs of the programs."

"9461430","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most premature infants have experienced extrauterine growth restriction by hospital discharge. Many remain small to adulthood and incur short- and long-term costs to their metabolic health, including an increased risk for obesity. Our long-term goal is to identify strategies to optimize the nutritional management of premature infants. The objective of this application is to determine whether prematurity limits the anabolic response to feeding and if this is mitigated by optimizing feeding strategies to enhance the efficiency of nutrient use for anabolic processes. The central hypothesis is that prematurity reduces lean growth, particularly in small for gestational age (SGA) neonates, but lean growth can be improved by cyclical stimulation of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling imparted by either feeding on an intermittent bolus schedule, rather than continuously, or by ad- ministration of intermittent leucine pulses when continuous feeding must be prescribed. The hypothesis is based on data from the applicants' laboratories. The rationale is that understanding the fundamental mechanisms by which different modes of feeding modulate lean mass in early life has the potential to translate into practices that will improve lean growth of preterm infants. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine if prematurity alters the protein synthetic response of muscle to feeding by blunting insulin- and amino acid-induced translation initiation; 2) Determine if lean growth is reduced in the preterm, particularly SGA, but is improved by intermittent bolus feeding rather than continuous feeding delivered either parenterally or enterally; and 3) Determine if intermittent leucine pulses enhance lean growth by stimulating protein synthesis and myonuclear accretion and reducing degradation in pre- term continuously fed neonates. We will determine body composition, growth rate, and muscle protein synthesis and degradation, satellite cell abundance and proliferation, amino acid and insulin signaling, metabolite and whole transcriptome profiles, and insulin and amino acid sensitivity in SGA preterm, appropriate for gestational age (AGA) preterm, and term pigs fed on an intermittent bolus schedule or continuously, either parenterally or enterally, and in those provided intermittent leucine pulses when continuously fed. The methods are established in the applicants' laboratories. The approach is innovative because it will examine in the preterm piglet model the coordinated response of muscle protein synthesis, degradation, myonuclear accretion, amino acid and insulin signaling, and metabolite and transcript profiles that regulate lean growth. The proposed work is unique because it is the first to comprehensively examine in a relevant preterm model the effectiveness of different feeding modalities including a novel leucine supplementation approach on component processes that determine muscle growth. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance our under- standing of how prematurity impacts the anabolic response to nutrition. The results will provide important novel information required for the optimization of the nutritional management of preterm infants."
"9495470","This application aims to identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities (drug targets or target pathways) that can be exploited by natural product chemicals (NPs) in a panel of ~130 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Many of these cell lines were established from human tumors by the Minna laboratory (collaborator) and recapitulate ~85% of the molecular features of their originating tumor. In addition, we aim to link these selective vulnerabilities to biomarkers through the analysis of somatic mutations, gene expression, proteomics and metabolomics data obtained at UTSW on the cell line panel. Furthermore, we will carry out mechanism of action studies utilizing a method developed at UTSW, Functional Signature Ontology (FUSION) to link gene expression profiles to a given mechanism of action. The platform will give mechanism of action hypotheses that we can further investigate with detailed biochemical and cell biology approaches. In initial screening of ~6,000 natural product fractions, we identified ~75 natural product fractions, that kill subsets of the NSCLC cell lines but not immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell lines. These will be the starting point for further studies. Our goal in this proposal is to identify the active natural product from the ~75 natural product fractions that have given unique signatures and to identify 1) a molecular target or pathway, 2) identify a putative biomarker that predicts sensitivity to the natural product, 3) validate the selective toxicity in organoid and in vivo models of lung cancer. Importantly, we have substantiated the utility of our unbiased, data-driven, bioinformatics pipeline using data generated at UT Southwestern, and through other large efforts (TCGA, COSMIC, etc.). For NSCLC, we have formulated therapeutic hypotheses of biomarker and perturbagen relationships for all of the synthetic small molecules and natural product fractions we've screened. !"
"9472880","Summary. Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are autoimmune disease characterized by chronic muscle weakness and inflammation. Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), adult-onset dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM) and inclusion body myositis (IBM) are major subgroups of IIM. In pathognomonic muscle biopsies of JDM and DM, there are remarkable perivascular inflammation with complement- mediated destruction of perivascular endothelium, leading to perifascicular ischemia and degeneration of muscle fibers. However, the triggers for complement activation and whether complement is engaged in the breakdown of immune tolerance in IIM have not been defined. A great impeding factor for research progress of IIM is the low prevalence of the disease and therefore statistical power of analysis becomes an issue. The International Myositis Genetic Consortium (MYOGEN) was created to facilitate and advance collaborations on genetic studies of IIM. Through application of immunochip for genotyping of MYOGEN samples of IIM patients, it has been shown that HLA-DRB1*03:01 of the ancestral haplotype AH8.1 in Caucasians is the strongest risk factors for all forms of IIM. Among European subjects, the presence of HLA-DRB1*03:01 is strongly associated with complement C4A deficiency. There are multiple layers of genetic diversity for complement C4, including multi-allelic gene copy number variations (CNVs) and gene size dichotomy for its two isotypes, acidic C4A and basic C4B. Through a meticulous pilot study, we have shown that C4A deficiency is a very strong and independent genetic risk factor for JDM, including under the presence of DRB1*03:01 (DR3+). Therefore, it would be of great interest to decipher the roles of C4-CNVs and C4A deficiency in various forms of inflammatory myopathies from the MYOGEN. The specific aim is ?To investigate the MHC complement genetic variants in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.? We will evaluate complement C4-CNVs and associated polymorphisms for C4A and C4B, plus nonsense mutations of MHC-linked complement genes, in the context of their linkage disequilibrium (LD) with specific HLA-DRB1 genotypes, on various forms of IIM from the MYOGEN (N=2566). Race matched control population with >1571 subjects is from our own collection. We will dissect the independent roles of HLA-DRB1 variants, C4-CNVs and C4A deficiency on disease risks of IIM and its sub-types. We will extend the project to a longitudinal study of local JDM patients through measuring the cell-bound levels of processed complement activation products that may yield insights on the mechanism of disease pathogenesis, and as a convenient biomarker for IIM disease activities.  Health related significance. Successful execution of this proposal will advance our knowledge on the genetic risk factors and mechanism of pathogenesis for JDM, DM, PM and IBM.

The long-term goal of this technology-development project is to improve the quality of life of end stage lung disease (ELSD) patients by developing wearable artificial lungs that compensate for the changing metabolic needs of the patient. The objectives of the current proposal are to: 1) develop a control system for a wearable artificial lung featuring sweep gas servoregulation to adjust CO2 removal based on patient needs; and, 2) evaluate the control system in an animal model. At the completion of this project, we expect to be ready to integrate the developed control system with various artificial lung systems that will, for the first time, enable large changes in patient activity during rehabilitation and daily life."
"9464515","Parathyroid hormone (PTH 1-34) is the only approved anabolic agent for the treatment of osteoporosis. Its mechanism of action is complex and not fully understood. PTH signals through the PTH1 receptor (PTH1R), as does PTHrp, another natural ligand for PTH1R. We have preliminary data that one downstream effect of PTH1R activation is a reduction in bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT), due either to a shift in lineage allocation of stem cells and/or lipolysis of existing adipocytes. We are now proposing a mechanistic ancillary study to an ongoing phase III clinical trial of a PTHrp analog, abaloparatide (BA058) to test our hypothesis that changes in marrow adipocytes are tied to the anabolic actions of PTH1R activation. The current randomized placebo controlled trial includes a PTH 1-34 comparator arm, and a sequential alendronate treatment arm followed by a two-year observation phase ( In our proposed ancillary study we will determine if BMAT is altered by activation of the NCT:01657162) for fracture efficacy. PTH1R, measureable on bone biopsies at 18 months by semi-quantitative indices, and test whether the earliest marker of marrow adipocytes , Pref-1, is altered in serum by treatment with PTH-1-34, abaloparatide, or alendronate. We will also examine for the first time if there is a spatial redistribution of adipocytes within the bone marrow that is associated with bone formation and aBMD. To test those hypotheses we propose two aims: Specific aim 1: To determine the impact of PTH 1-34 and abaloparatide on the volume of BMAT (AV/MV) and the number of adipocytes (ANo/MV) per marrow volume. We will assess this by comparing BMAT in 98iliac crest biopsies at 18 months in the BA058 randomized trial between placebo vs combined PTH 1-34 and abaloparatide-treated participants. We will test if aBMD changes from baseline to 18 and 60 months will be inversely correlated with the 18 month AV/MV and ANo/MV on biopsy. We will also explore if there is an inverse relationship between bone formation and ANo/MV and whether the spatial location of marrow adipocytes changes with anabolic therapy as well as their proximity to local bone forming surfaces and how this may impact final aBMD at 60 months. Specific aim 2: To determine if changes in Pref-1 predict BMAT differences in subjects treated with placebo, PTH 1-34, abaloparatide or alendronate. We will measure change in serum Pref-1 between 0 and 18 months and correlate those values with ANo/MV and AV/MV as well as aBMD and P1NP. We also plan an exploratory aim to determine if changes in Pref-1 between baseline and 36 and 60 months predict final aBMD and P1NP, a marker of bone formation. These proposed ground-breaking studies will provide a mechanistic framework for future work to define the cellular basis of anabolic therapies for osteoporosis."
"9460339","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cells and organisms have sophisticated stress responses to adapt to conditions where the availability of food or O2 is limited. These strategies that allow for survival in lean times can also increase lifespan, as animal lifespan can be increased by reducing either O2 or food consumption. Understanding how to manipulate stress response pathways could have important clinical applications to delay or reduce a host of age-associated conditions. This goal is hampered by current gaps in our understanding of fundamental stress response pathways, especially how multiple stresses interact physiologically. We have discovered that specific hypoxic conditions disrupt proteostasis, the coordination of protein production, folding, quality control, and degradation that preserves the integrity of the proteome. We further show that fasting can protect against the effects of hypoxia on proteostasis. The aak-2 subunit of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), a conserved energy sensor, is a central regulator of these effects. In fed animals, AMPK mediates the hypoxia-induced disruption of proteostasis. However, AMPK has the opposite role in fasted animals, which require aak-2 is required to protect proteostasis. The goal of the proposed research is to reveal mechanisms that underlie the different effects of hypoxia, and AMPK activation, in fed and fasted animals. We will then use our ability to manipulate proteostasis with hypoxia and food deprivation to test the hypothesis that defects in proteostasis pathways drive aging and the associated physiological decline. A focus of these experiments is on revealing processes that mediate changes in the aggregation of toxic proteins that are associated with progressive neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding how hypoxia signaling can modulate proteostasis may suggest new therapeutic strategies for these devastating diseases. Moreover, the results of this research will provide unique insight into fundamental features of how organisms respond when faced with multiple environmental stimuli, and begin to reveal how homeostatic responses to different stress conditions are integrated."
"9474675","Abstract Mindfulness meditation and Real-time Brain Activity in Schizophrenia (MARBAIS). Recent work suggests that mindfulness training is effective to treat schizophrenia. In mindfulness training, meditation takes a central position. However, learning to meditate is not straightforward as no immediate feedback to students is possible as there are no easily discernible outward signs of performance. In addition, a teacher's feedback may inadvertently be confounded, due to e.g. the ability of a student to describe internal states, the teacher's ability to interpret the students' verbal descriptions, or the student's interpretation of the teacher's instructions. A possible solution to this issue would be to provide neurofeedback during meditation, so individuals have an unbiased ?mental mirror? which directly informs them on their meditation quality in real time in an unbiased way. In a proof-of-concept study, we showed that EEG neurofeedback from the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) tracks mindfulness meditation quality in healthy novice meditators. However, as patients with schizophrenia suffer from a broad range of symptoms, including cognitive impairment and reduced attentive capabilities, it is currently unclear whether PCC activity and meditation quality are associated in schizophrenia. In the proposed study, Aim 1 will determine whether EEG neurofeedback from the PCC tracks the subjective experience of mindfulness meditation in schizophrenia. To achieve this, 20 patients with schizophrenia will perform a neurofeedback test-battery while performing mindfulness meditation. Aim 2 will determine whether patients with schizophrenia can volitionally modulate EEG neurofeedback from the PCC using mindfulness meditation. In addition, exploratory aim 3 will investigate whether there is an association between the ability to volitionally modulate neurofeedback from the PCC and schizophrenia- related symptomatology. This would be the first study to assess the association between a neurofeedback signal and meditation quality in schizophrenia. If we find that PCC activity tracks with meditation quality and patients are able to volitionally modulate activity by meditating, it would provide the rationale to investigate the efficacy of this non-pharmacological intervention in a randomized clinical trial."
"9546120","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Most B-cell lymphomas arise from germinal center (GC) B-cells, which form transiently after T-cell dependent antigen stimulation. GC B-cells undergo massive proliferation and genomic instability occurring as a byproduct of immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation, which puts them in danger of malignant transformation. The phenotypic shift from quiescent naïve B-cells to proliferative and unstable GC B-cells is massive, rapid, and involves differential expression of thousands of genes. GC B-cells are evanescent, and quickly undergo terminal differentiation to plasma cells (or undergo apoptosis) after antigen presentation. The most common B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL and FL) in essence are GC B-cells that have continued to aberrantly persist and fail to undergo terminal differentiation. We are interested in how these dramatic changes in phenotypes occur, and how this process can be corrupted to cause lymphoma. To understand the mechanistic basis of the GC B-cell phenotype we performed genome-wide chromosomal conformation capture (Hi-C, 4C) along with ChIP-seq for histone marks, cohesin and TFs at different timepoints during B-cell development. We observed truly massive shifts in chromosomal architecture in GC B-cells including but not limited to i) increased promoter connectivity, ii) formation of novel enhancer loops, iii) 5? to 3? gene looping, iv) merging of discrete boundary delimited gene neighborhoods to form larger gene ?cities resulting in de novo epigenetic coordination between genes formally isolated from one another, and v) establishment of GC B-cell specific locus control regions (LCRs) that control hundreds of GC B-cell gene enhancers (Bunting et. al. Immunity 2016). Strikingly, all of these architectural changes were tightly associated with cohesin complex redistribution and notably, we observed recurrent somatic mutation or deletion of the cohesin unloading protein PDS5B in public lymphoma genomic profiling datasets. Our pilot studies suggest that PDS5B regulates genes involved in exiting the GC reaction and terminal differentiation. Preliminary experiments in PDS5b knockout or point mutant mice, point to disruption of GC dynamics and blockade of GC exit. Based on these considerations we hypothesize that PDS5B is required to unload the GC specific cohesin distribution patter state so that the GC B-cell transcriptional program can be extinguished and allow for a different configuration that favors plasma cell differentiation. We predict that specific signals received from GC T-cells in the GC light zone directly induce PDS5B-dependent cohesin redistribution. We propose that genetic lesions of PDS5B cause the genome to become architecturally stuck in the GC configuration thus blocking epigenetic reprogramming required for terminal differentiation and leading to malignant transformation. We hypothesize that cohesin blockade may be nonetheless reversible and targetable by drugs that can erase GC/lymphoma epigenetic programming. This proposal will thus define the role and mechanism of action of dynamic cohesin complex remodeling in the humoral immune response and lymphomagenesis, and develop novel cohesin therapy approaches."
"9443576","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammalian skin and its appendages function as the outermost barrier of the body to protect inner organs from environmental hazards and keep essential fluids within the body. Understanding molecular mechanisms that operate in skin development is an important prerequisite for future applications in regenerative medicine and for developing therapeutic treatment for human disease. Many regulatory mechanisms including cell signaling, cytoskeleton remodeling, transcriptional and epigenetic controls and post-transcriptional regulation have been implicated to have important roles in skin development. Among these mechanisms, microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation exerts a widespread control over the output of the transcriptome. These noncoding RNA molecules broadly modulate a large number (~60% in mammals) of genes and play important roles in a wide range of biological processes. In mammalian skin, the critical functions of the miRNA pathway in embryonic and neonatal skin development have been well appreciated. However, individual microRNA functions and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In particular, microRNAs that play important roles in hair follicle morphogenesis are unknown despite extensive interests. To address this important issue, we propose to focus on the miR-200 family, a highly expressed microRNA family in the hair placode. Importantly, the loss of the miR-200 microRNAs in the skin leads to defective hair germ formation, consistent with their important functions in the skin. We will examine their roles in primary keratinocytes in vitro and in the hair placode in vivo (Aim 1 and 2). To provide mechanistic insights for their functions, we will apply biochemical purification of microRNAs and their associated mRNA targets to the WT and miR-200 knockout mice and identify miR-200-associated targets in a hair placode-specific manner. We will focus on comprehensively identifying important targets of miR-200 in regulation of cell proliferation, adhesion and migration as well as important signaling pathways in the skin. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate individual microRNA functions and provide mechanistic insights to these molecules during skin development with a particular focus on hair morphogenesis. The knowledge gained from these studies will pave the way to manipulate microRNAs in neonatal skin progenitor cells for regenerative medicine and enhance our understanding for microRNAs' roles in skin cancer."
"9487485","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This request is for upgrading an existing A1 NIKON confocal with a LUNV Laser Launch and DU-G detector unit. The A1 confocal is currently located in the BSRB Microscopy Facility, in the Genetics Department at UT-MD Anderson Cancer Center, under the leadership of Dr. Lozano. The BSRB Microscopy Facility was founded in 1998 and expanded its capabilities to cope with high demand to its current configuration. Our current A1 confocal was acquired in 2011 and it has been upgraded over the years and currently is integrated into a NIKON Ti microscope body equipped with motorized stage and CO2 stage-top incubator. Our system is composed of 7 laser lines: 405nm, 561nm and 647 nm are solid state lasers, and 453nm, 477nm, 488nm and 514nm are delivered by an Argon Ion Gas laser. Although the system is under service contract, the multi-line argon laser is no longer being supported by NIKON. A replacement option is available for the 488nm laser only with a solid state single-line laser, but since the existing laser launch only supports four lasers, we will not be able to replace the 453nm and 514nm lines, which we currently use. Thus, in order to keep our current functionality, we need to replace our existing laser launch with a new one capable of running at least 6 single- line solid state lasers. This new laser launch would also provide bright illumination with improved stability and reduced maintenance. Although our investigators are experts in good sample preparation, many of the projects involve samples that are limited in brightness for various reasons. Examples include: Dr. Behringer's group (major user) works with a variety of endogenous expressed fluorescent proteins (requiring multiple laser lines including 453nm and 514nm), that are sometimes weakly expressed, to study defects in reporter mice reproductive tract development; Dr. McCrea's group works with 3D image rendering of dendrites (about 2 mm thick) and performs co-localization analysis of two novel protein complexes PdLim5:delta catenin and Mag- 1:delta catenin within dendritic processes. He also plans to do image-based Fuorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) studies to look at the activity and spatial distribution of RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1 (by utilizing established GTPase activity FRET biosensors) at the dendrites as part of his recent NIH R01 submission. Dr. Andrew Gladden (junior faculty) currently looks at FRET signals of established vinculin tension sensor (VinTS) at the focal adhesions, which are very small in size and restricted to the base of the cell. Dr. Galdden also does multi-color live cell imaging of three-dimensional lumen and organotypic cultures. The majority of the projects cited in this application require confocal sectioning microscopy with optimal spatial resolution, multiple excitation lines covering the 405nm-640nm spectral range (including 453nm and 514nm lasers), high depth penetration as provided by laser excitation, high detection efficiency, and improved sensitivity. Therefore the acquisition of solid-state lasers and hybrid GaAsP detectors are necessary to provide adequate excitation illumination and to improve quantum efficiency and the quality of our data."
"9461576","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a member of the paramyxovirus family, is the leading cause of infant hospitalization from infectious diseases in the United States. Regular re-infection of adults during seasonal epidemics provides the ground for caregiver-to-baby transmissions, which aggravate the problem. Despite extensive research, no vaccine protection is available and current antibody therapy-based immunoprophylaxis remains reserved for high-risk patients. Recognizing the unmet pediatric clinical need for efficacious, readily applicable and cost-effective RSV therapeutics, it is the overarching goal of this proposal to apply a rigorous drug development approach to the problem and ultimately identify an anti-RSV therapeutic candidate and at least one mechanistically distinct alternative compound that are suitable for IND-enabling formal development.  Narrowly focused drug discovery campaigns are at high risk of early stage failure. We hypothesize that a comprehensive anti-RSV approach interrogating the full host-pathogen interactome for pathogen-directed and host-directed drug candidates has the highest prospect of ultimately yielding viable clinical candidates. This is based on the realization that traditional pathogen-directed therapeutics enjoy an excellent clinical record but can be compromised by emerging viral resistance and/or a narrow pathogen indication spectrum, whereas host-directed antivirals promise to overcome these limitations, yet are at present predominantly still in preclinical development. Building on our multiple-year expertise in the development of myxovirus inhibitors, we have in pilot studies engineered a first in class recombinant RSV expressing a luciferase reporter and developed an innovative drug screening protocol that allows the simultaneous identification of pathogen- directed and host-directed antivirals in a single-well setting. Proof-o-concept implementation of this screen has yielded, amongst others, a novel pathogen-specific small-molecule RSV entry inhibitor with exquisite toxicity profile and an innovative host-directed agonist class of cellular antiviral defense pathways. Lead compounds of both series show nanomolar inhibitory activity against pathogenic RSV variants. To maximize the prospect of success of this program and meet the clinical demand for effective RSV therapy, we will diversify the portfolio of anti-RSV candidates by implementing a full-scale drug screening campaign based on the newly established protocol (aim 1). In parallel, the existing leads and, as discovery advances, novel anti-RSV candidates will be mechanistically characterized and their molecular targets identified (aim 2). Candidates with high developmental potential will be subjected to hit-to-lead synthetic optimization guided by in vitro potency, ADME parameters and small-animal pharmacokinetics profiles (aim 3). The efficacy of lead candidates in alleviating key features of RSV bronchiolitis, airway damage, high lung viral load, mucus expression, and pulmonary obstruction, will be assessed in a newly established clinically relevant mouse model of RSV infection (aim 4)."
"9507164","PROJECT ABSTRACT Opioid abuse is a public health epidemic in the United States, and naloxone plays a critical role in opioid overdose prevention. To expand naloxone's availability and use by both emergency medical services (EMS) personnel and community bystanders (CB), states have enacted a variety of policy and regulatory responses, but we have little empirical evidence for how the the implementation of specific policies or policy combinations influence the sources, methods, and saturation of naloxone use across communities. This project will compile a comprehensive database of relevant state policies and provisions aimed at increasing EMS or CB use of naloxone and employ a modified Delphi approach to develop composite state policy scales that characterize the strength of state 1) EMS naloxone policy implementation, and 2) CB naloxone policy implementation. We will then use these developed composite measures to assess the extent to which strength of EMS naloxone policy implementation is associated with increased use of naloxone by EMS personnel of different certification levels and of different routes of administration as well as the extent to which strength of CB naloxone policy implementation is associated with increased pharmacy dispensation of naloxone to the public. Finally, we will explore whether the simultaneous presence of different types of EMS and community bystander naloxone policies interact to influence the use of naloxone by EMS or laypersons. By accounting for variation in the strength of policy implementation across states and over time, findings will inform public health and policy by improving scientific understanding of the key policy elements that promote naloxone access and use within the broader policy environment."
"9459414","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent and debilitating illnesses world wide, affecting ~17 percent of the population and causing enormous personal and economic burden. The impact of MDD is underscored by the limitations of currently available medications, including low response rates, treatment resistance, and therapeutic time-lag (weeks to months). These data highlight a major unmet need for more efficacious and faster-acting antidepressants. Recent studies demonstrate that a single low dose of scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, produces rapid and long-lasting antidepressant actions in treatment resistant patients. This rapid action, by a mechanism completely different from typical monoamine reuptake inhibitors, represents one of the most significant findings in the field of depression over the past 60 years. The mechanisms underlying the rapid antidepressant actions of scopolamine have not been identified, and the current application addresses this issue. Preliminary studies have found that scopolamine rapidly stimulates the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a pathway involved in synaptic protein synthesis, rapidly increases spine number and function of PFC neurons, and produces rapid antidepressant behavioral responses in rodent models. Moreover, the actions of scopolamine are blocked by rapamycin, demonstrating a requirement for mTORC1. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the rapid antidepressant actions of scopolamine result from stimulation of mTORC1 and increased synaptic connectivity in PFC that occur via a burst of glutamate and release of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This application describes an integrated multidisciplinary approach, including molecular, biochemical, electrophysiological, morphological, optogenetic, and behavioral studies to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will characterize the time course and regional localization of scopolamine-stimulation of mTORC1, spine density, and behavioral responses, and confirm the requirement for mTORC1 and BDNF using a combination of pharmacological, viral vector, and mutant mouse approaches. The hypothesis that scopolamine can rapidly reverse the synaptic and behavioral deficits caused by chronic stress will also be tested. Aim 2 will determine the role of glutamate-AMPA receptor transmission, which has been implicated in activity-dependent stimulation of BDNF-mTORC1 signaling and synapse formation, using microdialysis and selective inhibitors. Microinfusions and optogenetic approaches will be used to test the role of glutamate transmission in subregions of PFC and to identify target circuits that underlie rapid antidepressant responses. Aim 3 will test if the glutamate burst occurs via muscarinic-1 (M1) receptors located on GABA interneurons, resulting in disinhibition of glutamate transmission, using cell specific virally expressed floxed shRNA, M1 deletion mutants, and cell specific Cre mice. Characterization of the signaling pathways for scopolamine will identify fundamental mechanisms for rapid acting antidepressants and novel targets for safer, rapid-acting agents."
"9543599","Abstract  Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention of mortality is an approved therapy in nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) patients with ejection fraction (EF) ?35%. However, the DANISH ICD trial enrolled 1,116 patients with NICM and EF ?35% randomized to ICD (n=556) or no ICD (n=560), demonstrated lack of significant mortality reduction in ICD patients when compared to non-ICD patients (hazard ratio=0.87; p=0.28), but significant reduction in the risk of sudden cardiac death (hazard ratio=0.50; p=0.005). Data from prior clinical trials leading to ICD indications in NICM showed a nonsignificant but clinically meaningful reduction in mortality, and significant reductions in sudden cardiac death (DEFINITE: 458 patients; HR=0.65; p=0.08 and a subgroup analysis of the SCD-HeFT: 792 patients; HR=0.73; p=0.06). The DANISH patients were on optimal pharmacological therapy and 58% had CRT devices. Their 3-year mortality in non-ICD arm was around 10% vs. around 20% in DEFINITE and SCD-HeFT trials, which were conducted 10 years earlier, a reflection of different patient populations and different underlying therapies.  Since arrhythmogenic myocardial substrate is characterized by ventricular arrhythmias detected in long-term ECG recordings, we analyzed data from MADIT-CRT trial in 416 NICM patients in NYHA class II with QRS ?130 ms who were randomized to CRT-D and who had a 24- hour Holter ECG recording prior to device implantation. NSVT on preimplantation Holter (observed in 194 [47%] patients) was associated with hazard ratio of 3.08 (p<0.001), enlarged LVESVi >86 ml/m2 was associated with hazard ratio of 2.81 (p<0.001), and Non-LBBB QRS morphology (observed in 44 (11%) patients) with hazard ratio of 3.33 (p<0.001) in a multivariate model predicting fast VT?188 bpm or VF. This risk prediction model could guide therapeutic decisions regarding implantation of CRT-D, CRT-P, or ICD devices in NICM heart failure patients with QRS?120 ms.  In specific aim 1 of this proposal, we propose to validated this MADIT-CRT risk stratification model in 400 NICM with wide QRS?120ms. With an increasing interest in observations that late gadolinium enhancement assessed in cardiac MRI is associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death in NICM patients, we also aim to: 2) determine whether abnormal cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging with late gadolinium enhancement will be predictive for fast VT/VF and will further improve risk stratification in NICM with QRS?120 ms, and 3) to evaluate cost- effectiveness of the proposed risk stratification approach leading to utilization of less costly devices (CRTP vs. CERT-D)."
"9253431","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          This resubmission is comprised of three applications (Clinical and Data Coordinating Centers (CCC, DCC) and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Core). We propose to conduct a large (N=2100) simple, superiority trial in the US and Canada - BEST - comparing best open surgery to best endovascular revascularization to prevent mortality, limb-amputation or further revascularization in a target limb with critical limb ischemia (CLI), meeting the current mandate for assessing comparative effectiveness. Trial leadership is comprised of a closely integrated and highly experienced group of investigators based at a CCC (Brigham and Women's Hospital, BWH , Boston University Medical Center, BUMC, and Massachusetts Hospital, MGH, Boston, MA), a DCC (New England Research Institutes, Inc., Watertown, MA) and an Executive Committee of experts in the field. The Health Economics Group at BWH will work closely with the DCC to address assessment of quality of life and cost-effectiveness (C-E). The trial will be conducted at approximately 120 sites in the U.S. and Canada, builds upon prior feasibility data and endeavors to address limitations of current research in this area.  Peripheral artery disease prevalence is 15-20% over 70 years, with higher rates in smokers and diabetics. In the subset with CLI, 40% require limb amputation and annual mortality exceeds 20%. With the advent of endovascular techniques for revascularization, we demonstrate from our completed surveys that there is current equipoise among practitioners with respect to best therapy in the majority of CLI cases. The BEST trial will provide, for the first time, urgently needed clinical guidance for CLI management in the context of C-E by using: a pragmatic design, including a range of established techniques; a novel primary endpoint - MALE (major adverse limb event including limb amputation or major re-intervention, bypass graft/graft revision or thrombectomy/thrombolysis) - free survival; multi-disciplinary recruitment of vascular surgeons and interventional cardiologists and radiologists; and an innovative, cost-efficient C-E approach. Additional endpoints include other clinical event rates, functional status and QOL and C-E, all using standard definitions and instruments. 140 eligible centers in North America will be approached to ensure 120 are initiated and 80 sites each recruit 1 subject/month over 27 months accrual. Trial duration is 4.25 yrs - 2.25 yrs accrual and 2.0 yrs minimum follow-up. Two cohorts will be studied: All-Vein (N=1620) and Prosthetic Conduit (N=480). Within each cohort, the trial is stratified on 2 factors (4 strata): tissue loss vs. isolated rest pain and infrainguinl with/without significant infrapopliteal occlusive disease. In the All-Vein cohort, BEST has 85% power to detect an EVT vs. OPEN hazard ratio of 1.25 in the primary endpoint (MALE-free survival) with crossover rates accounted for, as well as 2% loss to follow-up. In the Prosthetic Conduit cohort, there is 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.70 for the primary endpoint. This resubmission fully addresses all prior reviewer concerns, to successfully and efficiently execute a trial that will provide important information for the CLI community."
"9456744","Abstract Wolfram syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic nerve atrophy, hearing loss, and neurodegeneration. The prognosis of this syndrome is currently poor and many patients die prematurely with severe neurological disabilities, raising the urgency for developing novel treatments for Wolfram syndrome. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction caused by the mutations in the WFS1 gene is the root cause of the disease. However, key molecular defects linking ER dysfunction to death of pancreatic ? cells, neurons, and retinal ganglion cells in Wolfram syndrome are not clear. Therefore, despite the underlying importance of ER dysfunction in Wolfram syndrome, no current therapies target the ER. We have recently discovered that the leakage of ER calcium to the cytosol, followed by subsequent increase in cytoplasmic calcium levels, induces death of ? cells and neurons in Wolfram syndrome. We have also discovered that dantrolene sodium, an FDA-approved drug for spasticity and malignant hyperthermia, can prevent death of ? cells and neurons in cell and patient-derived iPS models of Wolfram syndrome. Dantrolene targets ryanodine receptors localized to the ER and blocks ER calcium leakage to the cytosol. Preclinical studies revealed that dantrolene could prevent the progression of diabetes and maintain ? cell mass in a mouse model of Wolfram syndrome. These results raised the possibility that dantrolene might be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of Wolfram syndrome. The purpose of this phase 1b study is to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine a recommended phase 2 dose for dantrolene in pediatric and adult patients with Wolfram syndrome. ER is an emerging target for human chronic diseases including type 1 and type 2 diabetes and neurodegeneration. Its monogenic etiology makes Wolfram syndrome more amenable to discover drugs targeting ER dysfunction than other common conditions in which multiple factors typically interact to produce the disease manifestations. Our study on Wolfram may lead to a breakthrough for treatments of such common diseases."
"9459808","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies citing vitamin D deficiency associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have indicated that vitamin D supplementation might reduce the risk of or enhance therapeutic approaches to treat this disease. The discovery of a new secosteroidogenic pathway initiated by P450scc that produces vitamin D3 hydroxyderivatives has opened new options in treatment for RA. This first and main product of the pathway, 20(OH)D3, is non-toxic at concentrations as high as 30?g/kg. We have approached the molecular pathogenesis of RA under the thesis that RA is an autoimmune disorder characterized by T cell dysregulation and that the use of vitamin D analogs can enhance the immunomodulatory effects of T cells. For example, T cells activated by altered peptide ligand (APL) peptide of the immunodominant epitope of type II collagen (CII), ie A9, CII245-270 (A260, B261, N263), upregulate the expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) so that both 1,25(OH)2D3 and 20(OH)D3 enhance the suppression of the inflammatory responses by inhibiting Th1 and Th17 responses while increasing the production of Th2 cytokines and IL- 10. We feel that the net result of combining therapies with both analog peptides and vitamin D will be a synergistic downregulation of the severity of arthritis at lower and safer doses than either therapy alone. Yet the mechanism of this suppression remains unknown. Our central hypothesis is that T inhibitory cells induced by the APL upregulate the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) allowing vitamin D3 to act directly on T cells to enhance both the suppression of inflammatory cytokines and the secretion of Th2/regulatory cytokines ultimately leading to suppression of autoimmune arthritis; and that the noncalcemic 20(OH)D3, will be as effective and less toxic than the classical form of vitamin D3 [1,25(OH) 2D3]. To understand the mechanism by which vitamin D enhances this response we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1) To test the hypothesis that redirecting the T cell cytokine profile is a mechanism by which 20(OH)D3 enhances the effectiveness of an APL in attenuating collagen-induced arthritis, Aim 2) To test the hypothesis that modulation of autoimmune arthritis can be enhanced by combining two interventions[ 20(OH)D3 and an APL], and Aim 3) To test the hypothesis that 20(OH)D3 intersects the alternate T cell signaling pathway and affects APL driven T cell cytokine production. Successful completion of these experiments will demonstrate if vitamin D and analog peptides work in synergy to suppress autoimmune arthritis and whether the noncalcemic form of vitamin D, 20(OH)D3 is as effective as 1,25(OH)2D3."
"9640842","?    DESCRIPTION:  This application, submitted in response to RFA-DA-16-004, proposes to functionally validate genetic variants identified in a NIDA-funded R01 (DA17305; PI E. Nelson) in which GWAS analyses in a sample limited to opioid misusers tested the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms influence progression from exposure to severe opioid dependence. The strongest association was for SNPs in cornichon family AMPA receptor auxiliary protein 3 (CNIH3). Confirmation analyses performed in two samples with non-dependent opioid misusers yielded a genome-wide significant meta-analytic p of <4.3E-9 for rs10799590, an intronic CNIH3 SNP associated with reduced risk [OR 0.64 (0.54-0.74)].The large effect accounts for between 1.2 and 5.8% of the phenotypic variance. Furthermore, the association of CNIH3 is consistent with studies of opioids in animal models highlighting the importance of glutamate signaling.  This application's R21 phase proposes to generate transgenic mice into which human CNIH3 has been introduced (both the risk and protective haplotypes) using innovative adaptations of CRISPR technology. The R33 phase proposes to use these mice to test our overarching hypothesis that CNIH3 polymorphisms alter gene expression impacting AMPA signaling and behavioral response to opioids. We will use behavioral assays related to opioid dependence (conditioned place preference, extinction, and reinstatement; context-dependent sensitization), which previously connected AMPA signaling to opioids. We will determine gene expression in response to morphine, focusing on addiction-related brain regions in which AMPA receptor subunit composition changes have been reported, to determine whether significant differences are found between mice with the protective and risk-associated haplotypes. We will also examine potential routes by which haplotype-associated effects may be mediated. The R21 component of the project's specific aim is: AIM 1 To generate humanized Cnih3 mice carrying the identified protective and risk-associated haplotypes The specific aims of the R33 component of the project are: AIM 1 To examine phenotypic differences between groups of transgenic mice with the protective and risk- associated haplotypes (with wild type and Cnih3 knockout mice as controls) in the expression of morphine CPP, its extinction, and reinstatement and context-dependent sensitization (CDS) AIM 2 To determine whether the protective haplotype alters Cnih3 expression at baseline (pre-opioids) or in response to morphine in these behavioral paradigms AIM 3 To examine whether these haplotypes alter Cnih3 and related protein content in the post-synaptic density of brain areas associated with morphine-induced behavioral responses AIM 4 To examine evidence for epigenetic mediation of altered gene expression associated with these SNPs in response to morphine CPP, including identifying SNPs that alter the activity of enhancers"
"9248848","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Falls among older adults have become a serious public health problem because they result in inevitable injuries, increase hospital admissions, threaten independence, and reduce quality of life. Falls, however, are preventable and can be reduced through exercise. There are currently a number of effective exercise-based fall interventions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that can be used to address the problem of falls in older adults. However, there is little informed information on best practices in terms of comparative efficacy and cost effectiveness among the recommended intervention programs. This lack of information hinders policy makers, public health practitioners, health planners, aging service providers, and others in making decisions on how to effectively invest funds to implement the best evidence-based fall prevention programs. This project is intended to narrow this knowledge gap. Our long-term goal is to create an effective, low-cost, scalable community-based Tai Chi program to help public health practitioners and community-based organizations address the problem of falls among older adults and to help older adults maintain their health and independence in the community, thereby reducing the drain on health care spending. The overall objective of this proposal is to conduct a comparative efficacy and cost-effectiveness study of an evidence-based fall prevention program-Tai Chi: Moving for Better Balance (TCMBB). Specifically, research in this proposal will address the following two questions of parallel importance: will TCMBB be more effective compared to a CDC-recommended Strength Training program? If so, will the TCMBB be more cost effective in terms of cost per fall prevented and quality adjusted life year gained? These questions will be addressed by conducting a randomized controlled trial aimed at testing the efficacy of TCMBB and Strength Training programs relative to a Stretching control on reducing fall rate and improving balance and physical functioning. It will also evaluate whether TCMBB, compared to Strength Training, will be more cost-effective, relative to the Stretching program. The study will also address the sustainability of the effects of TCMBB intervention on the proposed outcomes. At the conclusion of the study, we will have bridged an important research-to-practice gap on the cost effectiveness of different fall prevention programs and expanded our knowledge regarding how to best invest funds for intervention programs to address the pressing problems of falls in older adults and to meet Healthy People 2020 goals for improving the health, function, and life independence of community- dwelling older adults."
"9446884","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is highly heritable and the cause of substantial morbidity, mortality, and personal and societal costs. To increase our understanding of the biological basis of schizophrenia, it is essential to identify precise causal mutations that influence risk. GWAS have been remarkably successful in identifying genomic regions harboring common SNPs associated with schizophrenia. The most recent PGC analysis yielded 128 genome- wide significant loci and this number will likely increase. However, the causative variants underlying nearly all GWAS loci have proven elusive. Existing imputation resources are not optimized for GWAS loci. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify causative mutations within schizophrenia GWAS loci. Common risk loci resulting from changes in copy number (i.e., copy number polymorphism, or CNP) are attractive casual mutations. CNPs that reside within GWAS loci (i.e., tagged by the associated SNPs) can alter the dosage or structure of regulatory elements and genes and exert functional impact to drive the observed association with SCZ. Multiple examples are in the literature. The contribution of CNPs to schizophrenia is unknown because large-scale surveys of CNPs are infrequent. CNPs are inaccessible to most current methods, and CNP imputation methods are underdeveloped. Since CNPs are highly plausible but largely unexplored, we propose to deeply sequence schizophrenia samples at the PGC GWAS loci to identify CNPs and uncommon SNP/indels, and then impute them into very large samples to test for association with very high power with schizophrenia. Identifying uncommon SNP/indels maximizes expenditure of the proposed study. Successful completion of the proposed work will enhance our understanding of biological mechanisms underlying the etiology of schizophrenia. If we can identify even a few CNPs or uncommon SNP/indels altering schizophrenia risk, it will represent an important advance in the field. Any CNP association is likely to have immediate biological relevance and amenability to current molecular biology and neuroscience methods. Furthermore, these schizophrenia-associated GWAS loci have never been deeply sequenced in the world-literature. The targeted resequencing data, the imputation reference, and CNP imputation methods generated from this R01 will be useful resources for the human genetics community. These data will also ensure that the community's forthcoming functional work on these risk loci is focused on the most promising variants."

"9493297","Nearly 50 major diseases ranging from diabetes to neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer?s (AD), Parkinson?s (PD) and Huntington?s (HD) diseases have been linked to protein misfolding and aggregation. Cells grow and proliferate under the constant threat of damage from endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS), exogenous oxidants and reactive electrophiles. Cytosolic protein cysteines are almost exclusively maintained in the reduced state, and cysteine oxidation caused by oxidative stress is predicted to result in significant misfolding and aggregation. However, relatively little is known about the consequences of redox imbalance on protein homeostasis (proteostasis). Furthermore, the roles of cellular reduction-oxidation (redox) buffering pathways, including the thioredoxin and glutathione systems, in maintaining cytosolic proteostasis are not well understood. We seek to understand the interplay between cytoprotective stress response pathways and the machinery employed to maintain proteostasis. Published and preliminary results detailed in the proposal lead us to hypothesize that induction of the cytoprotective heat shock response (HSR) by redox imbalance is mediated in part by a cysteine switch in the principal protein chaperone Hsp70 (Ssa1 in budding yeast) and that thiol redox buffering plays a significant role in maintenance of cytosolic proteostasis. The primary objectives of this renewal application are to determine the impacts of thiol-reactive stress on cytoplasmic protein biogenesis and protein quality control and to elucidate the regulatory interactions between oxidant and unfolded protein responses, through three distinct lines of investigation. In Specific Aim 1 we will define the mechanism by which the key molecular chaperone Ssa1/Hsp70 regulates the HSR through modulation of transcriptional activity by the master heat shock transcription factor Hsf1. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the consequences of thiol- reactive stress on Ssa1/Hsp70 activity and cellular functions, including how the Ssa1/Hsp70 redox switch regulates the HSR, and determine the roles of the highly conserved redox buffering systems in mediating thiol-reactive stress. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine the impacts of protein thiol modification on general cytosolic proteostasis using proteomic and genetic approaches. The work outlined in this proposal will reveal the mechanistic connections between cellular redox and protein quality control networks by exploiting the tractable yeast model system. These results in turn will guide future development of therapeutic interventions targeting ROS- and protein quality control-based disorders."
"9457335","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fibromyalgia (FM) is an idiopathic chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder affecting approximately 5 million adults in the United States.1-4 Though pain is typically considered the cardinal symptom of FM, most people experience a constellation of symptoms, including fatigue, sleep disturbances, depression, anxiety, morning stiffness, and cognitive problems.4-8 The latter, cognitive problems, are reported by approximately 70% of those with FM, and are rated as one of the most troubling FM symptoms.4,7-9 However, cognitive problems are rarely addressed by clinicians and are critically understudied. Commonly called fibrofog, this dyscognition has been described by patients as problems with concentration, memory, confusion, and speaking.4,6,8,10 Anecdotally, fibrofog is linked to devastating effects on quality of life and functioning; contributing to difficulties maintaining relationships, working, communicating, driving, organizing planning, and initiating activities of daily life.6,8 Distressingly little is known about the natur of fibrofog, despite its acknowledged prevalence and impact. Because the research that has examined difficulty on cognitive tests in FM is limited in scope and rigor, there are ongoing questions as to whether fibrofog is just a problem with attention and memory, or whether other areas of cognition are affected. Previous studies have also not adequately assessed or controlled for the effects of coexisting symptoms or compared FM to other clinical groups, such as depressed individuals; therefore, it is not known whether fibrofog is a manifestation of other FM symptoms (e.g. depression, fatigue) or a unique set of problems. Because there has been very limited neuroimaging research in FM, there is a lack of understanding of the neurological processes that might be contributing to fibrofog. Finally, there have been no efforts to examine the validity and utility of existing cognitive assessment tools in FM; so, researchers and clinicians have no direction as to which tools to use to assess fibrofog severity.  The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide education and training to the Principal Investigator (PI), Anna Kratz, PhD, so that she has the requisite knowledge and skills to address these limitations in the scientific evidence on fibrofog. Dr. Kratz is a clinical psychologist whose research has focused on chronic pain in medical conditions such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, and multiple sclerosis. The proposed training plan will allow her to extend her knowledge from chronic pain into the areas of cognitive dysfunction, neuroimaging, and outcomes measurement. The PI has demonstrated commitment to a career in clinical health research, and a history of scholarship and research productivity. The University of Michigan provides her with a supportive, stimulating, and collaborative environment that offers an abundance of resources and support for early career scientists and clinical research. A diverse and accomplished mentoring team has been assembled to guide the PI toward expertise in cognitive dysfunction in FM, neurocognitive and self-report assessment technologies, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Dr. Kratz's short-term career goals are to gain expertise in the nature of fibrofog, neurobiological functioning, neuroimaging, and evaluating and developing contemporary measures of fibrofog. These short-term goals will support her progression toward her long-term plan to develop an independent research program that makes significant contributions to the understanding and treatment of cognitive problems in other medical conditions where dyscognition is present but not the central focus of the condition. Ultimately, the skills that she acquires through the proposed training and research may be used to identify mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction that are common across medical diagnoses.  The scientific objectives of this application are to methodically describe the phenotypic nature of fibrofog, examine the neurobiological processes underlying these cognitive problems, and test the utility of cognitive measures in fibrofog. First, to characterize the major areas of cognitive problems in fibrofog, a comprehensive set of contemporary (NIH Toolbox of Neurological and Behavioral Function) and gold standard neuropsychological tests will be administered to a sample of individuals with FM and an age- and sex-matched depressed control group. Second, functional magnetic resonance imaging will be conducted on individuals with FM and depressed controls while they are completing cognitive tasks. This will examine the dynamic connectivity of relevant brain regions that might provide insight about neurobiological mechanisms underlying fibrofog. Comparisons to depressed controls in terms of neuropsychological test performance and neurobiological functioning will provide insight about how fibrofog may be distinct from depression-related cognitive problems. Third, newly-developed and traditional measures of cognitive dysfunction will be submitted to psychometric analyses to determine their validity, reliability, and utility in detecting fibrofog. The ultimate aim of this study is to improve the clinical care of individuals wth fibrofog through the advancement of our understanding and assessment of this troubling set of symptoms. This award will enable Dr. Kratz to acquire the expertise and skills necessary to become an independent researcher capable of achieving the overall goal of elucidating the scope and mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in FM."
"9687621","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Together, physical inactivity and poor diet make up the second leading modifiable cause of death in the US. Racial disparities in these behaviors and associated health outcomes present major public health challenges. The specific aims of the USC PRC for 2014-2019 build on a long and successful history of applied research and practice in underserved communities: 1) grow the Center infrastructure; 2) engage communities, state and local health departments, and other stakeholders to inform our activities; 3) implement an integrated set of strategies to disseminate Center research findings, products, and programs; 4) contribute to the development of skilled community members and public health professionals through training and technical assistance; 5) evaluate Center activities and outcomes; and 6) conduct an applied public health prevention research project. Achievement of these aims will lead to the following long-term outcomes: 1) increased translation of research into practice and policy; 2) improved environmental and system-wide strategies; 3) widespread use of evidence-based programs and policies; 4) enhanced community capacity for health promotion and disease prevention; 5) increased skilled public health professionals and community members; 6) expanded resources for applied public health research; and 7) increased recognition of and support for USC PRC research and activities. The USC PRC's applied research project will study the dissemination and implementation of an evidence-based program shown previously to significantly increase physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake in churches in South Carolina (Faith, Activity, and Nutrition; FAN). Guided by two theoretical frameworks, the specific aims of the applied research project are to: 1) examine the adoption and reach of FAN in churches and organizational factors associated with adoption; 2) characterize implementation fidelity and multilevel factors associated with implementation; 3) describe organizational maintenance of FAN and factors associated with maintenance; and 4) study the effectiveness of FAN. In Phase 1, we will randomize churches in a rural county with a high proportion of African American residents to receive training in FAN from a community health advisor (n=40) or to be part of a delayed intervention control group (n=20). This phase will allow us to study dissemination and implementation in a range of diverse religious denominations and gain greater understanding of how local coalitions can reach faith-based communities as settings for intervention. In Phase 2, we will work with two large faith denominations in SC, including one that is predominantly African American, to disseminate the program statewide. This phase will allow us to identify key considerations in program dissemination, adoption, and implementation and to examine the potential for broader geographic dissemination. Increasing physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption are important goals of the CDC's Winnable Battles and the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion's environmental approach to preventing chronic disease and promoting health."
"9505095","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients? in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship ? that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors? and their caregivers? perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients? baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs."
"9455688","Driving is inarguably a highly visual task. A large body of work has found that drivers with visual sensory impairments (e.g. impaired contrast sensitivity, visual field defects) and/or higher order visual- cognitive processing deficits (e.g. slowed visual processing speed, impaired divided attention) are at increased risk for collision involvement as indicated by accident reports obtained from state licensing agencies. Essential to a comprehensive understanding of the role of vision in driver safety is how the driver's visual capacities ? both visual sensory and visual-cognitive skills ? impact vehicle control and behaviors before and during a vehicle crash. While accident reports provide a wealth of information about the circumstances of a crash (e.g., place, weather conditions, vehicles involved), they tell us little to nothing about the visual mechanisms underlying the occurrence of a crash. In this research plan we implement an innovative approach to study vision and driver safety -- using naturalistic driving data, which avoids the methodological pitfalls associated with accident reports. Naturalistic driving data are generated by participants driving their own vehicles in the course of their everyday life for a year or greater. Their vehicles are unobtrusively equipped with sensors and video cameras, which record vehicle kinematics, GPS location, presence of near-by objects, driver behavior, and the roadway environment. Naturalistic data provide an unprecedented level of objective detail on safety critical events such as crashes and near-crashes including pre- and peri-crash information about driver behavior and contextual factors. We propose to use an existing data source, the Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP2) Naturalistic Driving Study. SHRP2 collected naturalistic driving data on 3,541 drivers aged 16-98 years old containing 35 million vehicle miles of travel. Specific aims in our research plan will examine associations between crash and near-crash involvement and both visual sensory function and visual- cognitive function, adjusted for age, mileage, and other potential confounders. We will further examine how associations between visual function and crash and near-crash events are modified by the driver's involvement in potentially distracting secondary tasks, risk-taking characteristics, age, and situational on- road characteristics. This research plan will contribute to our knowledge of how visual impairment and distracting behaviors while driving contribute to actual on-road safety and motor vehicle collisions. This information will be invaluable in designing interventions and countermeasures to enhance driver safety in the US and worldwide by elucidating modifiable factors that are associated with increased collision risk."
"9520145","Project Summary/Abstract Environmental exposures to industrial chemicals, such as carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) causes toxicant-induced steatohepatitis (TASH) characterized by fatty liver, inflammation, and fibrosis. Although susceptibility to occupational and environmental TASH may be modified by genetic predisposition (SNPs) and nutritional factors, our central hypothesis are that obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) increase the severity of TASH by (1) Inducing the activity of cytochrome P450 2E1, (2) Increasing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activating NADPH oxidases (NOXs), and (3) Inducing dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and increased intestinal permeability. The goal is to determine the mechanism by which obesity and CCl4 synergistically facilitate progression of TASH to liver cirrhosis, and develop new approaches to identifying toxicants that induce TASH. The following specific aims have been developed: (AIM1) To study the effect of ?fast food diet? (FFD)- induced obesity and NAFL on CCl4-induced TASH. We propose to use improved diet-induced and genetic mouse models, including mice expressing human CYP2E1 gene and knock-in PNPLA3 mice (expressing the human SNP associated with NAFL). Since hCYP2E1 mice are more susceptible to toxicants, we anticipate that production of Nox1 and Nox4, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by activated Kupffer cells, and development of liver fibrosis will closely recapitulate the pathology observed in patients with NASH/TASH. The specific role of NOX 1 and 4 in this TASH model will be assessed by pharmacological inhibition. (AIM2) To investigate the role of dysbiosis in transgenic mice subjected to fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from patients with NASH or matched normal controls from a well phenotyped cohort. We propose that the microbiome from NASH patients will render mice more sensitive to CCl4, while the transfer of ?healthy? microbiota will decrease liver fibrosis in these mice. We will then do a therapeutic intervention by FMT of normal flora into a mouse with liver fibrosis to assess reversal of TASH. (AIM3) To translate our findings in mice to humans, we will utilize a ?human liver in a dish? (exVive3D? Livers, Organovo), a 3D culture composed of 4 primary hepatic cell types that maintains architectural and functional features of the human liver for greater than 40 days. These cultures will be subjected to Superfund toxicants and then assessed for TASH. The effects of potential drugs, such as Nox inhibitors, will be assessed in these 3D culture models of TASH. Overall, we will develop a high through-put system for ex vivo drug screening by measuring hepatotoxicity of Superfund toxicants and effectiveness of therapeutic interventions."
"9541398","PROJECT SUMMARY I propose to determine how loss-of-function of the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) kinase causes age- dependent degeneration in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the second most frequent dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Heterozygous mutations were identified in the TBK1 gene as causative of familial and sporadic FTD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Disease is likely to arise from haploinsufficiency as the majority of familial TBK1 mutations produce premature stop codons leading to non-sense mediated mRNA degradation. TBK1 is an IKK family kinase previously identified for a central role in controlling type- I interferon production in response to viral infection. It does this by phosphorylating interferon regulation factor 3 (IRF3), a transcription factor. TBK1 has also been implicated in regulating autophagy by its phosphorylation of the autophagy receptors optineurin (OPTN) and P62/SQSTM1, mutations in which cause FTD/ALS. Loss-of- function (LOF) variants in TBK1 causing FTD/ALS produce cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregation, a hallmark of FTD instances without Tau or FUS pathology and in >95% of ALS. Patients that bear both a TBK1 mutation and another dominant disease-causing variant, such as GGGGCC repeat expansion of C9orf72 and point mutation in FUS, develop premature onset of ALS/FTD at ages of 40-50, suggesting that reduction in TBK1 activity may modulate aging of the central nervous system of synergize with other disease-causing mutation. In this proposal, I plan to conduct two independent but closely-related research aims to identify how TBK1 contributes to maintenance of a normal nervous system and how reduction in it contributes to age-dependent FTD and/or ALS. To identify mechanism(s) underlying toxicity in FTD and ALS mediated by reduced TBK1 activity, I will 1) determine whether TBK1 haploinsufficiency causes cognitive and/or motor deficits in aged mice; 2) determine whether reduction or deletion of TBK1 broadly from neurons across the brain causes cognitive or motor deficits; 3) determine whether deletion of TBK1 from motor neurons causes motor neuron deficits; 4) determine whether reduction in TBK1 kinase activity is a pathological feature of FTD (and ALS) in TDP-43, FUS, and C9orf72 mouse models; 5) determine whether toxicity from reduced TBK1 activity is non- cell autonomous using co-cultures of wild type, Tbk1+/-, or Tbk1-/- cortical neurons, astrocytes, and/or microglia. To identify the role of TBK1 in TDP-43 aggregation, I will 1) determine whether TBK1 kinase activity is activated by TDP-43 cytosolic aggregates 2) determine whether reduction in TBK1 or its activity affects clearance of TDP-43 aggregates, using an inducible TDP-43 aggregation system I have established in a neuronal cell line (SHSY5Y); 3) determine whether Tbk1 haploinsufficiency exacerbates deficits of TDP-43 transgenic mice."
"9229585","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Mental Health Treatment Study (MHTS), a national randomized trial, funded by the Social Security Administration (SSA), provided access to evidence-based treatment and rehabilitation interventions for SSDI beneficiaries, including dual eligibles, with serious mental illness (SMI). Key MHTS interventions were systematic medication management, care coordination, and supported employment. The MHTS enrolled 2,238 persons during 2006-2008, randomized to treatment or control, and assessed impacts over a 2-year follow-up. Evaluation results, based on self-report data, revealed potentially important positive outcomes on (1) mental health status, (2) earnings, and (3) reduced use of inpatient and crisis outpatient services. Evidence indicated these positive outcomes increased over time in the 2-year period. We propose research to replicate and extend previous MHTS evaluation studies of service use impacts by analyzing a large database of CMS administrative data on MHTS trial enrollees. Our replications studies will broaden the scope of previous studies by including longer follow-up periods, up to 4 additional years, and a much wider range of behavioral health services covered by Medicare or Medicaid, including both inpatient and all outpatient services, as well as use of prescription pharmaceuticals. We will also develop separate service use impact estimates for major sub- groups of MHTS participants, including persons with schizophrenia. Major data sources for the analyses will include: Medicare claims and enrollment files, Medicaid MAX data, all MHTS interview data, and all SSA administrative data previously used in the MHTS study. Our proposal is a collaboration of the researchers from UMBC, Westat, and SSA involved in earlier MHTS studies. We will estimate MHTS impacts on volumes and patterns of service use, on major sub-categories of services, and sub-group/interaction impacts of MHTS using regression methods. Methods common in health services utilization studies will be used, including hurdle, zero- inflated, and other multi-part models. We will also test for attrition bias in our results using administrative data.  Our analyse have the potential for significant public health impacts for both substantive and methodological reasons. The group of persons from which MHTS enrollees were drawn - adults with SMI who are receiving public income support and coverage through public health insurance programs - is large and accounts for an important share of total services provided through these public health insurance programs. Thus, full-scale implementation of the MHTS interventions could have an important influence on the volume and mix of services provided under these programs. From a methodological perspective, our findings will be based on more reliable administrative data, a longer follow-up period, a broader scope of service use outcomes, and assessment of attrition bias. These findings can serve to illustrate the public health importance, in future services intervention trials, of incorporating these same methods and leveraging Federal data sources across agencies, rather than relying solely on narrower self-reported data over a fairly brief follow-up period."
"9462617","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to achieve a durable cure of HIV through the use of autologous gene-modified cells in a 'Defend and Destroy' approach. Our central premise is that autologous cells can be used to eradicate HIV if they are 1. Genetically rendered HIV-uninfectable, and, 2. Enhanced in their activity by specific measures to destroy viral reservoirs. We have therefore assembled a team of investigators with complementary areas of expertise to execute the following specific aims: Specific aim 1: Utilize novel genetic modification technologies to engineer HIV- resistant immune systems with enhanced ability to destroy viral reservoirs. (Derrick Rossi, PI) This takes advantage of expertise in the Rossi lab with the CRISPR- Cas9 genome editing system and modified-mRNA technology. Specific aim 2: Enhance engraftment of gene modified hematopoietic stem cells with reduced toxicity, niche sparing conditioning of the host to minimize morbidity and costs without compromising targeting of viral reservoirs. (David Scadden, PI) Specific aim 3: Test approaches for viral control and vira reservoir depletion in a HIV-infected and anti-viral treated 'humanized' mouse model. (Todd Allen, PI) Specific aim 4: Pre-clinical development of HIV-resistant hematopoietic stem cells. (CRISPR Therapeutics, Rodger Novak, PI) Each aims maps to a project and the projects are supported by two cores: A. Administration and Biostatistics, and, B. Humanized mouse core generating, treating and analyzing BLT mice infected with HIV and treated with triple drug anti-retroviral therapy.  Each of the four Specific Aims described above could be conducted independently as a scientifically significant research project. However, it is the synergy achieved  through the coordinated accomplishment of these aims that will enable the testing of a multi-pronged strategy for eradicating HIV infection. Testing of such a complex set of strategies, which together represent the platform for a Defend and Destroy approach to curing HIV infection, would simply not be possible if any one project were conducted out of the context of the other three. Thus, it is only the concerted execution of this package of four Projects, supported by two critical Cores, that will facilitate testing of the proposed, highly novel strateg for curing HIV."
"9471867","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Human memory is essential for everyday living, shows robust trajectories of improvement across childhood, and is known to be impaired in a number of neurodevelopmental disorders. There is substantial data in memory physiology in adults but a paucity of information on how this core human skill emerges in children. Further, noninvasive techniques used to probe the neural basis of human memory development are unable to measure both the spatial and temporal properties of memory at high resolution. Electrocorticography (ECoG) in patients with surgically implanted subdural electrodes for treatment of intractable epilepsy is a powerful tool for examining the neural basis of human cognition. ECoG provides the spatial and temporal resolution needed to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of memory during childhood. This is the first project that will focus on assessing the neural basis of memory in children using ECoG. In the patient cohort, memory will be assessed with both ECoG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This will generate a multimodal data set to study basic questions regarding the development of memory but can also address fundamental unresolved questions on the neural signals recorded with fMRI. Additional fMRI data collected from a large sample of healthy children will help us determine the age differences in activation and connectivity between the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), key regions in the memory network. The ECoG data from pediatric epilepsy patients will be used to contextualize those developmental findings with remarkably high spatial and temporal precision that is not available with noninvasive methods commonly used with children. Our central hypothesis is that increased communication between MTL and PFC underlies memory capacity across healthy development. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing: Specific Aim 1) Identify regional activation supporting memory in children using ECoG and fMRI; and Specific Aim 2) Identify inter-regional interactions supporting memory in children using ECoG and fMRI. Reliable ECoG measures for pre-surgical mapping of memory networks in children with intractable focal epilepsy undergoing resective surgery will ultimately be used to predict memory deficits following surgical resection. To that end, the investigators will determine whether the extent of surgical disruption of memory- related sites identified by ECoG activity predicts post-operative memory outcome (Specific Aim 3). Thus, findings from this project will provide crucial information for the future development of tools for pre-surgical mapping of memory networks in children with focal epilepsy. Such clinical applications will influence diagnostic and therapeutic surgical approaches, and ultimately improve quality of life in patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy."

"9527376","PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG."
"9465426","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to improve the quality of care in nursing homes (NHs) are long-standing, but concerns regarding poor quality of care persist. Fundamental change is likely needed to improve NH quality given the challenging and complex environments in which NHs operate. Through NH culture change and its advocated practices, deep systematic change aims to advance resident-centered/directed care and improve NH quality of care and life. The long-term goal of this research is to improve NH care and the quality of life within NHs by providing evidence on how culture change implementation impacts quality. The central hypothesis motivating this proposal is that greater implementation of NH culture change practice results in higher NH quality. The proposed study will be the first to use a diverse national sample of U.S. NHs and data from a longitudinal panel study including data from 2009/10 and 2015/16 survey responses to understand whether increases in culture change practice implementation and increases in critical domains of practices are associated with improved quality. The study will pursue the following three Specific Aims: 1) Describe the extent of culture change practice implementation in U.S. NHs in 2015/16 and the changes in implementation between 2009/10 (Time 1) and 2015/16 (Time 2); 2) Evaluate whether increase in implementation of culture change practice (overall and by critical domains) be- tween Times 1 and 2 is associated with improvements in: a) quality outcomes including lower rates of function- al decline, bedbound [i.e. bedfast] status, weight loss, behavioral problems, incident pressure ulcers, and hospital deaths; b) care processes including lower use of hospitals and of restraints, antipsychotic drugs and feeding tubes; and higher rates of bladder and bowel training; and, c) NH performance including reduced staff turn- over and health-related and quality of life survey deficiencies; and 3) Evaluate whether higher versus lower presence of NH Leadership and Family and Community Practices is associated with a) quality outcomes, b) care processes and c) NH performance (see Aim 2). This study is innovative since it will be the first national longitudinal panel study to examine how implementation of NH culture change practices has changed over time and whether increases in culture change practice implementation are associated with improvements in NH quality. This study is significant because its design and its planned propensity-matched difference- in- differences analyses will provide needed evidence for provider and policy maker decision making, and integral for improving the quality of care and life for vulnerable older adults in U.S. NHs. This knowledge is critical as many states are now implementing or changing their Medicaid NH pay-for-performance programs to acknowledge adoption of culture change practices with inadequate evidence to support these decisions; similarly, providers are implementing practices with inadequate evidence of their effect."
"9459290","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a new application from the Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) Clinical Trials network. By the end of 2014, the network will have completed 4 clinical trials testing 7 interventions in approximately 1000 women ages 40-62 with vasomotor (VMS) and other menopause symptoms. In the new application, we propose to conduct a large multicenter trial on a relatively understudied area of menopause - vaginal health and sexual function. The number of US women over age 65 is expected to double by 2022 and approximately 40% will experience bothersome vaginal symptoms, 75% may have vaginal dryness and up to 40% may experience pain with intercourse. To address this vast, understudied problem, we propose in Specific Aim #1 to conduct a 3-arm, randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial among postmenopausal women ages 45-70. We will evaluate the effectiveness of ultra-low dose vaginal estradiol (Vagifem 10 mcg), non-hormonal hydrophilic non-prescriptive vaginal gel (Replens) and placebo in reducing a composite score of vaginal symptoms (dryness, itching, irritation or soreness). Secondary aims include evaluation of sexual function, quality of life, and genitourinary atrophy and the creation of a biorepository of vaginal and blood specimens. In a subset of women, we will also examine whether treatment response is related to: a) the postmenopausal vaginal microbiome; b) vaginal mucosal inflammation; and c) reproductive hormone profiles. The in-depth focus on the mechanisms associated with postmenopausal vaginal symptoms will use state of the art microbiologic techniques on longitudinally collected biologic specimens and will guide future translational studies. Specific Aim #2 addresses common problems for many midlife women and their providers: a) menopausal symptom management decisions can be challenging, due to rapidly changing and sometimes contradictory data on treatment safety and efficacy; and b) individualized decision aids to help women feel fully informed about various menopausal treatment options are lacking. To translate and disseminate our findings on postmenopausal vaginal health, in addition to findings from prior trials on vasomotor, sleep, mood and pain symptoms, we propose to develop and pilot test a comprehensive, state-of- the-art, tailored, multi-media materials aimed at facilitating informed menopausal decision-making for symptomatic women and their providers. Involvement of midlife women and healthcare providers at every stage in the process has been incorporated. This application is novel and transformative for: 1) proposing the first adequately powered, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of hormonal and non-hormonal treatments for postmenopausal vaginal symptoms; and 2) for providing the first, multi-media menopause decision aid that encompasses the latest evidence surrounding all available therapies. These aims are geared to transforming the evidence-base and resources available to aging women for navigating midlife and beyond."
"9520147","Project Summary/Abstract Soils and waters with high levels of toxic metal(loid)s such as cadmium, lead, arsenic and mercury are detrimental to human and environmental health. These 4 heavy metal(loid)s are among the Superfund's top 7 priority hazardous substances. Many human diseases have been attributed to environmental contamination by heavy metals, including cancers and neurological disorders. Research and applications indicate that uptake of heavy metals into plant roots and accumulation of heavy metals could provide a cost effective approach for toxic metal removal and bioremediation of heavy metal-laden soils and waters. In recent research we have made major advances at understanding key mechanisms that function in heavy metal detoxification, transport and accumulation in plants. However important genes and pathways that function in heavy metal over- accumulation in plants remain to be identified. We will combine powerful genomic, genetic, biochemical and engineering approaches to test new central hypotheses by pursuing the following Specific Aims: Aim I. The regulatory mechanisms, transcription factors (TFs), and transcriptional network that mediate rapid heavy metal(loid)-induced transcriptional responses in plants remain largely unknown. Using a luciferase- based cadmium- and arsenic-induced reporter mutant screening approach we have isolated mutants in rapid Cd- and As-induced gene expression. New mutants in major Cd-/As-dependent repression and induction loci will be characterized and the underlying genes isolated and their functions determined. Collaborative research with Geoffrey Chang (Project 5) will pursue development of cost-effective innovative heavy metal toxicant nano-reporters in plants. Aim II. The many genetic redundancies in plant genomes cause major limitations in heavy metal response gene discovery. To address redundant gene function on a systems biology scale we have designed a genomic scale artificial microRNA (amiRNA) library for genome-wide knockdown of homologous gene family members which is leading to discovery of new genes and will be used to characterize key plant genes and network mechanisms that function in heavy metal accumulation, resistance and remediation. Aim III: Using genes identified in Specific Aims I and II and previous research, gene-stacking will be used to generate plants and investigate their enhanced heavy metal accumulation and root sequestration (phytostabilization) potential. Furthermore, by genomic investigation of plants that are being used for phytostabilization at semi-arid Superfund sites, the above advances will be used in collaboration with the University of Arizona Superfund Research Center to uncover mechanisms that render plants suitable for phytostabilization of toxic metal(loid)s. The proposed research will be leveraged to develop technologies for avoiding the growing problem of accumulation of heavy metals and arsenic in edible plant tissues."
"9487088","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The over-65 population is not only increasing at an alarming rate, but because six out of 10 will be managing more than one chronic condition by 2030, they will make up a much greater proportion of hospitalizations than ever before. Hospitalizations for disease, injury, and/or surgery in this group are likely to impair physical mobility and, therefore, the older adult's capacity to be physically active both during hospitalization and beyond. The resulting sedentary lifestyle is likely to be accepted as the new normal, ultimately increasing the risk of skeletal muscle and metabolic dysfunction (e.g. impaired glucose disposal, insulin resistance). These devastating outcomes are neither inevitable nor necessary if prevented with an appropriate mechanism-based intervention. A novel mechanism that may contribute to physical inactivity-induced insulin resistance is accumulation of inflammation and ceramide within skeletal muscle initiated by activation of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/MyD88 signaling pathway. We have previously shown that skeletal muscle TLR4/MyD88 signaling regulates pro-inflammatory pathways and ceramide biosynthesis whereas knockdown of TLR4 protects muscle against lipid-induced insulin resistance. Of interest, increased skeletal muscle TLR4, inflammation and ceramide has been tied to various metabolic disturbances such as diabetes and insulin resistance. However, it is currently unknown if skeletal muscle TLR4/MyD88 signaling and the subsequent increase in inflammation and ceramide are a key mechanism associated with insulin resistance due to physical inactivity in older adults. Dr. Drummond's preliminary work supports the hypothesis that physical inactivity increases TLR4, inflammation, and ceramide biosynthesis in skeletal muscle of older adults. Additionally, our preliminary data in mouse experiments indicate that hyperactive MyD88 signaling regulates insulin resistance caused by short- term physical inactivity. Therefore, Dr. Drummond and his multidisciplinary research team have proposed to conduct parallel clinical studies in older adults and a series of mechanistic studies using muscle-specific mouse models and drug intervention studies to test whether skeletal muscle TLR4/MyD88 signaling is important in the production of inflammation and ceramide and therefore insulin resistance caused by physical inactivity. These findings will be foundational for developing treatments to prevent insulin resistance in inactive older adults."
"9499529","Project Summary Most allergic reactions are caused by immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies that are specific for allergens and trigger potent inflammatory responses mediated by mast cells and basophils. IgE binds to the high affinity receptor (Fc?RI) expressed on these allergic effector cells, making this a key interaction that is common to many different allergen-specific responses. The anti-IgE therapeutic antibody (Omalizumab) is currently used to treat allergic asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria in patients. We determined the structure of the Omalizumab Fab bound to the IgE-Fc, clarifying how Omalizumab blocks IgE interactions with both receptors. We also designed an IgE-Fc glycosylation mutant that does not bind Omalizumab, but retains interactions with high and low affinity IgE receptors. This IgE glycovariant can be co-administered with Omalizumab, to replace the cell-bound IgE, exchanging allergen-reactive IgE with a non-reactive variant. This co-treatment of cells provides synergistic inhibition that is more potent at blocking basophil activation than either inhibitor alone. Our IgE glycovariant, which incorporates a single additional N-linked glycosylation site into the IgE-Fc, also shows more potent inhibition of basophils on its own as compared to the wild type IgE-Fc. The inhibition does not require direct competition for FceRI binding by ?allergic? IgE. We hypothesize that carbohydrate-specific inhibitory receptors, such as members of the Siglec family, may be engaged by the IgE glycovariant to block Fc?RI signaling. In this proposal, we will explore the impact of IgE glycosylation on the inhibition of human basophil activation, both with and without concomitant Omalizumab treatment, and identify the mechanisms by which IgE glycovariants suppress FceRI-dependent activation of allergic inflammatory cells."
"9523371","Alzheimer's disease (AD) and similar dementias present substantive challenges to patients and families, including medical, emotional, and fiscal hardships. Understanding the basic molecular underpinnings associated with AD progression is imperative to develop targeted strategies to intervene before notable cognitive decline occurs in patients. Glial cells, the first immune responders in the brain, are believed to influence AD pathology, although the molecular and cellular details are still unclear. Healthy glial cells can efficiently engulf amyloid-beta (A?), one of the major neurotoxic proteins that forms aggregates in the AD brain, and it has been proposed that defects in glial clearance of A? may contribute to the onset or advancement of AD. How do glia clear A? in the brain? What are the molecules and signaling pathways that govern glial recognition and engulfment of A?? Finally, what is the fate of A? once it has been internalized by glial cells? Using a well-established AD model in Drosophila melanogaster, we have identified the Draper receptor as a novel neuroprotective molecule against A?-induced toxicity. Draper is a highly conserved glial engulfment receptor required for glial phagocytic clearance of apoptotic neurons and degenerating axons. Notably, the role of Draper or the mammalian orthologs (MEGF10/Jedi) in glial clearance of A? function have never been explored in vivo. Here, we show that loss of glial Draper results in greater A? accumulation, exacerbates locomotor defects, and further reduces lifespan, while activation of glial Draper reverses these molecular and behavioral phenotypes. Our preliminary work also suggests that Draper-dependent activation of autophagy pathways may influence the progression of A?-induced CNS dysfunction. Thus, we hypothesize that glial cells utilize the Draper receptor to internalize and/or degrade neurotoxic A? peptides in the adult brain and that Draper activity attenuates A?-induced phenotypes. Draper activates several downstream signaling pathways, including altered cytoskeletal remodeling, autophagy, and transcription (specifically, STAT92E and AP-1). In Aim 1, we will use genetic and microscopy methods, as well as behavioral assays, to interrogate known downstream signaling effectors of Draper to determine which pathways protect against A? accumulation, motor defects, and reduced longevity. In Aim 2, we will investigate the possibility that Draper influences A? propagation throughout the CNS. More specifically, we propose that glial Draper/autophagy promotes A? destruction, thereby inhibiting A? peptide spreading. Using in vivo genetic manipulations and super resolution microscopy, we will inhibit glial Draper and autophagy pathways to determine if A? propagates more readily in the adult brain. This work will rapidly offer new molecular insight into how Draper/MEGF10 is coupled to AD progression and, more broadly, will provide a significant advancement in our understanding of how glial immunity is linked AD, as well as other proteinopathies."
"9471878","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk? from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior."
"9454213","PROJECT SUMMARY It is our hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are heterogeneous conditions and, therefore, a paradigm shift is required to identify specific subpopulations for targeted interventions. This approach has generated significant success in other complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. A key opportunity in this context is the identification of those most likely to benefit from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs and other anti-inflammatory compounds. The relation between inflammation and the development of AD, MCI, and cognitive decline has received a great deal of attention with basic science and observational human studies demonstrating a protective effect against cognitive loss. Likewise, in our work, inflammation has been a key mechanism in the biological profile that is indicative of disease presence. Based on a wealth of literature (epidemiological, cross-sectional, pathobiological and animal model), multiple clinical trials have been conducted to determine the utility of NSAID compounds in treating or preventing AD (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study [ADCS] AD and MCI anti-inflammatory trials; Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial [ADAPT]); however, each of these studies failed to demonstrate therapeutic benefit, in fact some patients may have exhibited worsening cognitive performance with treatment. Our preliminary data suggests that particular subsets of patients in these trials did benefit from treatment and that our blood-based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify both positive and adverse responders within these trials. Here we propose to leverage three previously conducted clinical trials to test our hypothesis that our blood- based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify the subsets of patients who benefited from these previously conducted clinical trials. By conducting proteomic assays from existing biorepositories from the ADCS and ADAPT, we will address the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate the utility of the proinflammatory endophenotype as a means for patient selection into NSAID therapy for treating and preventing AD; Specific Aim 2. To determine if change in proinflammatory endophenotype scores over time is a biomarker of therapeutic response. By leveraging a highly innovative method and substantial existing resources, the current project addresses a significant need in the search for novel approaches AD therapeutics. The significance of the current project is the identification of a specific subset of patients who will experience clinically significant cognitive benefit from administration of NSAID medication. If successful, the current project will set the stage for a novel clinical trial that enrolls patients specifically based on baseline proinflammatory endophenotype scores for administration of NSAID therapy. In the long-term, this line of research is designed to build a person-centered (i.e. personalized) approach to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."
"9459994","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among the major mental illnesses of early adulthood, people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) (i.e., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder) exhibit a continuum of impairment in social functioning. Treatment is minimally effective, and impairments tend to persist. Knowledge on the neurobiology of social cognitive (SCog) process impairment will foster therapeutic discovery. At each of our sites, pilot data show that people with SSDs who are among the most socially impaired have a low likelihood of functional recovery and manifest impairment in discrete brain circuits that are known to be involved in the neurobiology of SCog processes in healthy individuals. Leveraging our pilot data, which is consistent across three sites, and the expertise of our group in SSD research related to phenomenology, outcomes, multi-site neuroimaging, and treatment innovation, we propose to use the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) investigational framework in people with SSDs to comprehensively and definitively delineate the neurobiology of SCog process impairment. Our approach will employ advanced structural and functional neuroimaging approaches to identify the neural circuitry (along a continuum from healthy controls to people with SSDs) that predict impairments in SCog processes and concomitant social function. We plan to use advanced neuroimaging and network analysis approaches including: 1) gray matter morphology approaches to map the thickness of the cortex and examine cortical thickness network topology, 2) DTI acquisition and analytic approaches to map white matter circuits in the brain; and 3) fMRI-based approaches to engage these same circuits, including functional connectivity measures to obtain detailed measures of circuit function. We will then use our group's expertise in sophisticated multivariate neuroimaging statistics (partial least squares), to extract dimensional features relating brain structure ->brai function -> behavior and provide a comprehensive understanding of the neurobiology of social processes from circuit to behavior across normal and abnormal (SSDs) domains. Our proposal is modeled directly within the RDoC framework; specifically, we are using a Matrix of Analysis as our guiding structure to identify the neurobiology of SCog process constructs from normal controls across the entire schizophrenia spectrum. We anticipate identifying substantially abnormal brain-behavior relationships starting from the level of circuit characterization. The ultimate goal of our collaborative team is to identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of social impairments by identifying the underlying neural circuitry and pathophysiology of impaired social function."
"9640747","?    DESCRIPTION:   Basic and clinical research suggests there are extensive bidirectional interactions between circadian rhythms and addiction. Disruptions to the circadian system, either by environmental or genetic perturbation, may increase the vulnerability to addiction, while chronic drug use leads to circadian disruptions that persist during abstinence and may contribute to relapse. Although these relationships are intriguing, very little is known about the molecular  mechanisms  underlying  the  relationship  between  the  circadian  system  and  the  transition  to  addiction.  Animal studies have demonstrated that chronic exposure to cocaine leads to alterations in the expression and function of specific circadian genes (i.e., components of the molecular clock) in the mesolimbic dopamine reward system.  A major region of convergence for reward circuitry and a key substrate that regulates drug reward and motivation is the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The NAc is comprised of mostly two specific subtypes of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that predominantly express either dopamine 1 or 2 receptors (D1+ or D2+). These two subtypes of MSNs have distinct roles in the regulation of cocaine reward behaviors, although the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences remain unclear. Recent human genetics studies have identified variants in the gene coding for the circadian transcription factor neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) associated with psychiatric disorders that are highly comorbid with addiction disorders. We have identified a novel role of NPAS2 in the regulation of cocaine reward via activity in D1+ MSNs of the NAc. The R21 aims are as follows: 1) Leverage CRISPR/Cas9  technology to generate split Cre mice that enable us to use intersectional genetics approaches to target D1+ or  D2+ MSNs specifically in the striatumR and 2) Generate NPAS2Qdeficient mice exclusively in striatal D1+ or D2+  MSNs to investigate the cell type specific molecular mechanisms regulating reward and motivation (R33 phase).  The R33 aims will characterize these mice by 1) investigating the role of Npas2 in the regulation of circadian  regulation  of  cocaine  conditioned  reward  (conditioned place  preference)  and  self-administration  2)  NPAS2Q mediated circadian transcription on cocaine-induced dendritic plasticity in the NAcR and 3) elucidating the cell  type specific molecular mechanisms of NPAS2 regulation of cocaine reward using confocal microscopy, FACs,  RNA seq, and integrative analyses with preliminary ChIPseq data. These studies will further clarify the role of  the molecular clock in the transition to addiction, and importantly, provide the broader scientific community with  novel transgenic mice to further investigate the molecular mechanisms of 'direct' and 'indirect' pathway regulation  of drug reward and addiction phenotypes. These studies will leverage CRISPR/Cas9 technologies and advanced molecular and behavioral approaches to study a novel mechanism of circadian regulation of addiction behaviors."
"9566855","PROJECT SUMMARY  BMD (bone mineral density) is the most commonly studied major risk factor for osteoporosis (OP). So far, GWAS studies have identified ~100 BMD marker loci with common variants, in samples with females only or with both males and females. The identified loci, in total, explain <10% BMD heritability and their sex-specific genetic effects are largely unknown. In addition, specific functional DNA sequence variants are also generally unknown.  The Goal of this project is to most comprehensively identify potential functional DNA sequence variants, in particular those rare and structural variants, for male BMD, and to assess their sex/ethnicity generality/specificity and their ultimate importance to the most devastating clinical outcome of OP - osteoporotic hip fracture (HF).  During the past ~two decades, we have 1) recruited one of the largest samples in the field; 2) established broad collaboration; 3) assembled an experienced team with extensive multi-disciplinary research productivity.  In this project, we propose to capitalize on our unique extensive resources to fulfill the following Specific Aims:  Aim 1. Identify (Discovery) potential functional variants for male OP risk by whole-genome sequencing  We will perform a large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to search for functional variants associated with BMD in 3,200 unrelated US Caucasian males with extremely discordant hip BMDs (1,600 with high and 1,600 with low hip BMD). To further increase the power, we will perform WGS imputation (for common & rare variants) in >6,500 independent male subjects (used in our earlier GWAS) for combined analyses with the WGS data.  Aim 2. Validate promising functional variants discovered in Aim 1 and identify those sex-specific ones  We will validate the 200 top variants identified above in an independent sample of 12,000 US Caucasians (both males and females). Sex-specific or sex-general effects of these variants will be assessed.  Aim 3. Assess ethnicity/population-generality/specificity of the identified variants  Ethnicity/population-generality/specificity of the top ~50 most significant variants validated in Aim 2 will be tested in ~85,000 subjects, including Caucasians, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and East Asians.  Aim 4. Test the identified BMD variants for their relevance to HF  We will test at least 20 top BMD variants validated in Aim 2 for their relevance to HF, in the world largest collection of an independent sample of 10,493 HF cases and 10,815 matched controls.  Data from this project will be examined integratively with other functional omics data from Proj 2&3 (transcriptome and epigenome) in this U19 program project and from our proteomics project (R01AR057049, PI Dr. Deng). The purposes are to 1) gain insights into the potential functional mechanisms of the variants/genes identified in this project, 2) identify additional significant functional variants/genes by synthesizing various omics data. Regular eQTL (expression QTL), mQTL (methylation QTL), pQTL (protein expression QTL) analyses and innovative integrative multi-omics analyses will be performed in Proj 1-3 and particularly in Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core."
"9664019","ABSTRACT Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are essential to improve health care delivery and patient outcomes, and are increasingly tied to reimbursement. To date, the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system has emerged as the leading prescriptive system for developing CPGs and is widely used both in the US and worldwide. Development of CPGs is the product of group judgment. Surprisingly, and despite the importance of group judgments for issuing guidelines, little work has been done to analyze how the CPG panels make their judgments within or outside GRADE system. Because the GRADE is considered the best prescriptive system for development of CPGs, we hypothesize that the panels' group judgments will accurately reflect a relationship between GRADE key criteria (?cues?) and the strength of recommendations, modified to some extent by other factors known to affect people's decision-making. To address our hypothesis, we will assess the impact of GRADE factors on group judgment process vs. individual panel members according to the lens model (SA#1). We will supplement this analysis with the qualitative evaluation of additional constructs that are not formally included in the GRADE system (SA1b). In SA#2, we will address the role of contextual factors and other factors that may affect the consistency of CPG judgments (e.g., more socially relevant topics, greater diversity of CPG panels, and/or panels with conflict of interest will generate greater discrepancy between individual and group judgments). In total, we will study 14 CPG panels, which will generate about 2,000 practice recommendations. To meet our short-term objectives, we propose an innovative study aiming to explain CPG panel judgments using theoretically sound lens model. Our long-term objective is to improve CPG panel judgments accuracy. By improving understanding of CPG judgment processes, the proposed study will exert sustained impact on the way we develop CPGs. Both public health and healthcare financing depend on reliable, trustworthy CPGs. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand group judgment processes that are foundations of the CPG development."
"9275506","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Impaired glucose metabolism (gestational diabetes (GDM) and mild hyperglycemia) that occurs during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for pregnancy complications and is also an early indication of long- term metabolic dysfunction leading to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In the US, GDM is commonly diagnosed using a two-step screening and diagnostic approach. The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) proposed a one-step diagnostic approach that broadens the definition of GDM by lowering the cutoff values to include women with milder forms of hyperglycemia, who would have screened normal under the current two-step approach. The goal of these recommendations is better identification of women at risk for pregnancy complications and long-term metabolic dysfunction, but it results in a significant increase in the prevalence of GDM. The NIH Gestational Diabetes Consensus Development Conference committee does not recommend changing from the current two-step screening/diagnostic approach to the IADPSG one-step diagnostic approach without trials demonstrating that increasing the number of women diagnosed as having GDM results in better outcomes. In this application, we aim to 1) conduct a real world randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine differences in short-term perinatal health outcomes with GDM testing between the two predominant GDM screening approaches, and 2) prospectively follow the mothers to examine their metabolic risk profiles and the growth of their infants at one year postpartum. Based on a pilot feasibility study, we propose a single site blinded RCT of 920 pregnant women at 18-24 weeks' gestation between ages 18-45 years who have not been diagnosed with diabetes, with a singleton pregnancy. Participants will have a non-fasting 1 hour 50 gm glucose challenge test (GCT) performed between 24-28 weeks' gestation. Women with 50 gm GCT results < 200 mg/dL will be randomized to receive either a fasting 2 hour 75 gm oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or a 3 hour 100 gm OGTT. GDM will be diagnosed using the IADPSG criteria for women receiving the 75 gm OGTT and Carpenter-Coustan criteria for women receiving the 100 gm. Participants and their physicians will be informed of the diagnosis of GDM, but will be blinded to the specific test results and criteria used to make the diagnosis. Participants with GDM will receive treatment as determined by their primary physician or midwife, and all participants will continue routine prenatal care. Brief questionnaires will be used to assess participants' and physicians' views on GDM testing. Metabolic profiles for participants will be assessed at randomization and at a year postpartum. The primary outcome measure is large-for-gestational age fetal growth. The rationale for the proposed research is that this is a unique opportunity to compare the two methods. At the end of the study, we will know whether women diagnosed at lower glucose levels with the IADPSG criteria are more likely to have adverse perinatal outcomes. It is our hypothesis that using IADPSG diagnostic criteria will result in detection of more women with impaired glucose metabolism and that treating these women will reduce adverse perinatal outcomes and prevent long-term metabolic dysfunction. This study will provide data grounded in level A evidence, to evaluate the two screening methods so universal guidelines for GDM screening can be endorsed by major organizations and implemented into clinical care."
"9520700","Abstract Lung cancer accounts for 27% of U.S. cancer deaths. The National Lung Screening Trial demonstrated that lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces lung cancer mortality. Guidelines recommend offering annual LCS accompanied by smoking cessation treatment to high-risk, older individuals. Payers cover LCS for high-risk individuals, and Medicare requires LCS sites to offer smoking cessation to current smokers. Health care systems adopting LCS have a critical new opportunity to deliver tobacco cessation treatment to smokers at a teachable moment. However, an optimal treatment strategy for these long-term, highly dependent smokers undergoing LCS has not yet been determined, and there are challenges to integrating tobacco treatment services into high-volume radiology practices. We propose a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design to examine the development, integration, and implementation of a novel, personalized, English and Spanish language, evidence-based smoking cessation intervention into LCS sites in a large, diverse, integrated health care delivery system, comprised of two networks. To maximize the reach of tobacco treatment, smokers will be offered personalized assistance and outreach at up to 3 time points (LCS test order, scan, and results). We will utilize novel health information technology (IT) platforms to promote patient outreach and access, using technologies like patient portals, informational videos (Vidscrip), and video- conferencing. Guided by the Health Belief and Self Regulation models with a chronic disease management perspective, the multi-component LCS-tailored intervention targets the older, long-term, heavy smokers who will undergo LCS. It provides counseling support and pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy [NRT]); is personalized to smokers' risk perceptions, readiness to quit, and LCS results; and systematic screening and referral to community-based resources to address social barriers to quitting. A centralized tobacco treatment specialist will deliver the intervention in a series of proactive motivational telephone- or videoconferencing- based sessions to sustain patient engagement. A randomized trial with a factorial design will test 3 intervention components that vary by (1) counseling duration, (2) NRT dose, and (3) systematic screening and referral for social barriers to quitting among 960 current smokers undergoing LCS at 6 screening sites. The primary outcome is biochemically-validated 7-day point-prevalence tobacco abstinence rates at 6 months. Exploratory analyses will identify patient- and LCS-level factors that moderate the relationship between intervention group and smoking outcomes, including socio-demographic characteristics, medical and smoking characteristics, and LCS-related factors (i.e., LCS result, time point of study entry). Guided by the RE-AIM framework, we will conduct a rigorous mixed methods evaluation of the intervention's reach, adoption, implementation (including cost-effectiveness from provider, payer and patient perspectives), and maintenance. Our program could provide health systems nationally with a sustainable model to integrate tobacco treatment into LCS screening."
"9456517","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endochondral ossification is a fundamental bone forming process involved in normal bone development. It is also recapitulated in pathological conditions such as bone fracture healing and osteophyte formation in osteoarthritis. The precise sources of osteoblasts responsible for trabecular bone formation during endochondral ossification remain not fully defined. Our recent genetic studies provide strong in vivo evidence in support of the hypothesis that a significant fraction of hypertrophic chondrocytes have the ability to become osteoblast lineage cells accountable for trabeculae formation in endochondral bones. Our data further suggest the additional hypothesis that during chondrocytes to osteoblasts transdifferentiation, Col10a1-expressing mature chondrocytes may first dedifferentiate to become mesenchymal progenitor cells in the bone marrow before they redifferentiate into osteoblasts. We propose to perform additional genetic experiments to further substantiate our findings and to provide evidence for the two-step hypothesis underlying the proposed transdifferentiation of mature chondrocytes into osteoblast lineage cells during development and postnatal growth. Other experiments will test the additional hypotheses that hypertrophic chondrocytes are a source of osteoblasts in fracture healing and in osteophyte formation in osteoarthritis. Our proposed experiments should lead to a revision of presently accepted concepts regarding the source of osteoblasts in endochondral bones. Our expected results should have a broad impact on the biology and pathogeny of endochondral bones."

"9498344","Every novel drug or therapeutic regimen, whether based on biological or chemical agents, requires extensive investigations for the assessment of dosing, formulation, administration schedule, and duration. These studies, however, are complex, costly and time consuming, indicating the need for a versatile and effective enabling tools to test and correct in real time for inappropriate dosing, duration, and frequency of administration. In this study, we will develop a remotely controlled implantable nanofluidic technology that enables precise increase, decrease, activation, or interruption of drug delivery in vivo. The technology is highly innovative, and offers long-term, fine, continuous modulation in dose centered on the use of embedded gate electrodes and Bluetooth Low Energy Radio Frequency (RF) communication. Further distinction is based on three key aspects: 1) electrostatic gating of nanochannels, 2) ultra-low power consumption, and 3) implant versatility with respect to drug composition (small molecules, proteins and nanoparticles can all be released), animal size (the implant is suitable for small and large animals), and material composition (inexpensive components). To develop this device, we propose the following experimental aims: Aim 1) To design and assemble remotely controlled delivery implants. A nanochannel membrane with gate electrodes and an implantable device containing a drug reservoir, electronics, a battery, and a remote control system will generate a prototype to control, enhance, decrease, interrupt, and reactivate the release of agents. Aim 2) To investigate the tunable and remote controlled release of drugs in vitro. Here, we will demonstrate function of the implant and its broad applicability to biomedical studies involving drugs of different molecular size and physicochemical properties. Aim 3) To test the RF-controlled implant for the tunable delivery of drugs in small and large animals. Devices will be subcutaneously tested in rodents (small implant) and macaques (large implant). Remote modulation of drug delivery will be assessed via pharmacokinetic analysis of a representative drug. Integrity and performances of RF-communications will be simultaneously studied. If successful, the proposed investigation would create a broadly applicable working technology that leverages nanochannel membranes for finely controlled modulation of therapeutic release of a broad spectrum of agents to address biomedical research needs across multiple systems or diseases."
"9681736","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behaviors are sequences of actions that are executed in the proper order and correct setting to achieve a goal. Action sequences and their association with the specific environmental contexts in which they are beneficial can be hardwired, as in the case of innate behaviors, or learned and flexible, as in the case of adaptive responses to changing surroundings. The basal ganglia, a complex set of phylogenetically ancient subcortical nuclei, collect sensorimotor information from across the cortical mantle and project via output nuclei to thalamic structures that regulate action; this circuit organization suggests that the basal ganglia may play key roles in modulating ongoing patterns of action. Consistent with this possibility, neurological and psychiatric diseases that disrupt basal ganglia function also disrupt action selection, sequencing and execution. Furthermore, neural correlates have been identified within the basal ganglia that predict, accompany and lag different features of behavior. However, three key questions remain open about the relationship between basal ganglia activity and behavior. First, it is unclear whether the basal ganglia primarily encode behavioral sequences, the action components of behavioral sequences, or both. Second, because of the temporal diversity of task-related activity observed in the basal ganglia, it is not clear whether activity in specific populations of neurons is causal for behavior. Finally, because most research into basal ganglia function involves overtraining in operant tasks, it is not clear what the core principles of action encoding are that govern basal ganglia function during spontaneously generated patterns of behavior like exploration. Here we propose to take advantage of a novel 3D machine vision technology uses Baysean inference to classify spontaneous behavior on fast (e.g. neural) timescales to probe the causal relationships between neural activity in the basal ganglia and action. We will focus our analysis of the main output nucleus of the basal ganglia; the substantia nigra pars reticulate (SNpr). We will first seek to identify predictive neural correlates within the SNpr for action components and behavioral sequences by combining our behavioral analysis methods with dense electrical recordings, both during normal exploration and during the execution of innate approach and avoidance behaviors triggered by odor cues from foods, conspecifics and predators. We will then test the causal relationship between activity in these SPnr neurons and specific features of behavior by using closed- loop optogenetics to subtly alter global patterns of activity within SPnr neurons themselves. This work will shed light on the mechanisms used by the brain to create self-generated patterns of action, and yield important clues about how the links between neural activity and action are altered during disease."
"9519366","Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms that control effector lymphocyte stability and plasticity, and how this regulation influences human health and disease. Recent studies indicate that innate lymphocytes possess substantial plasticity. The underlying mechanisms, and the implications for health and disease, remain unknown. Our preliminary data indicate that exposure to Notch signaling can elicit innate lymphocyte plasticity and train mature group-2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) to acquire the ability to co-produce large amounts of both ILC2- and ILC3- characteristic cytokines, thus converting natural ILC2 (nILC2) into plastic inflammatory ILC2 (iILC2). Our new data suggest that such plastic iILC2 are relatively enriched in the airway of patients with severe refractory asthma. In this project, we will use adoptive transfer, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and RNA sequencing experiments to explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which Notch signaling elicits ILC2 plasticity. We will also examine the capability of human and mouse iILC2 to mediate airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. Finally, we will investigate the association between the development of plastic iILC2 and the susceptibility to severe refractory asthma in human adult patients. Together, these experiments will shed light on the mechanisms that govern lymphocyte lineage stability and plasticity, and will inform strategies of targeted therapy to treat patients with asthma and other auto-immune and inflammatory disorders."
"9457294","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our studies link for the first time the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease - ApoE4 - with major longevity determinants, the Sirtuins; and identify the first candidate therapeutics that target this new link. Alzheimer's disease (AD) currently afflicts more than 5.4 million people in the US at an estimated cost to society of greater than $200 billion per year. The currently approved drugs for AD provide only short-term symptomatic relief but do not alter disease progression. The dominant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the epsilon-4 (e4) allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE4), which is present in about two-thirds of AD patients. The ApoE4 allele (chromosomal locus 19q13) confers increased risk for sporadic and late-onset AD (LOAD). Despite over a decade of knowledge that the ApoE4 allele is somehow contributory to the disease process, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying ApoE4-associated AD risk remain unclear. Our studies shed light on a novel mechanism for ApoE4-mediated toxicity and revealed a key mediator - SirT1 - that is differentially affected by ApoE4 vs. ApoE3. Interestingly, while both ApoE3 and ApoE4 bind to APP, only ApoE4 associates with nanomolar affinity (Kd ~80nM), and only ApoE4 significantly: (a) reduces the ratio of sAPPa to Aß; (b) reduces SirT1 expression, resulting in a marked reduction of SirT1 levels and in the ratio of neuroprotective SirT1 to neurotoxic SirT2; (c) triggers tau and APP phosphorylation; and (d) induces programmed cell death. In our initial screen of a clinical library we have identified a promising hit (A03) that is a repurposing candidate, is highly brain permeable, and reverses the reduction of SirT1 levels. As part of this proposal we plan to complete the preclinical testing of A03 and develop new chemical entity (NCE) analogs of A03 for further development. In addition, through screening and hit-to-lead optimization we plan to discover new lead candidates for further testing. The eventual goal of the proposal is to provide 1-2 candidates for non-GLP toxicity testing. Our data support the hypothesis that neuronal connectivity - influenced by the ratios of critical mediators including sAPPa:Aß, SirT2:SirT1, APP:p-APP, and tau:p-tau - is programmatically altered by ApoE4. The collaboration with the Clinical Core and the Gylys lab is important in this project, as it would provide preliminary analysis of plasma and CSF samples from ApoE genotyped patients for levels of SirT1. Such data would be extremely useful for future development of ApoE4-targeted drug candidates to clinical testing and SirT1 as a potential plasma biomarker in MCI/AD. In addition, comparing SirT1 with other biomarkers in plasma/CSF that are affected by the sirtuin/NFkB signaling is planned and would help further elucidate the role of ApoE4 in AD. The overall primary objective of this project is to identify potent, orally active, brain permeable SirT1-enhancing lead candidates that are suitable for further preclinical IND development as the first ApoE4- targeted SirT1 therapeutics for AD and to development the tools necessary to ascertain target engagement and efficacy."
"9478355","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will analyze three key, interrelated social determinants of HIV/AIDS and STIs-mass incarceration, housing stability, and subsidized housing policies -and the mechanisms through which they intersect to shape HIV-related sexual risk behaviors and race disparities in these behaviors. To date, research on the association between mass incarceration and HIV/AIDs and STIs has focused on incarceration's effects on relationship stability. Less attention has been paid to its effects on housing stabilityas a linking mechanism. Yet, extensive research has established housing stability as a social determinant of HIV/AIDS, though it rarely includes attention to mass incarceration. Nor has attention been paid to how policies that limit access to subsidized housing based on drug use and criminal history may impact on housing stability. At a time when subsidized housing increasingly represents the only available affordable housing option for the poor, such policies likely affect housing stability, not only among those directly involved with the criminal justice (CJ) system but among their loved ones as well. Thus, there is strong rationale to investigate the intersecting impacts of mass incarceration, housing stability, and subsidized housing policies on HIV/AIDS. Toward this end, this project has three specific aims: (1) To analyze variation across the US in the degree of restrictiveness of subsidized housing policies as it relates to rates of HIV/AIDS and STIs, and race disparities in these rates. This will be done through systematic coding of policies according to their degree of restrictiveness, and analysis of how policy variation is associated with disease rates; (2) To understand from the perspective of vulnerable populations how mass incarceration-including history of CJ involvement (personal, family, and sexual partner) and exposure to 'hyperpolicing-housing stability, and experiences with subsidized housing policies intersect to impact HIV/AIDS/STI related sexual risks, and produce race disparities in these risks. This will be done through analysis of longitudinal qualitative and quantitative data collected from individuals recently involved in the CJ system and/or living in or seeking subsidized housing; and (3) To examine from the perspective of various stakeholders, including policymakers, program implementers, landlords, CJ personnel, and housing and legal service providers, how subsidized housing policies are interpreted and implemented locally and why they are interpreted and implemented in this way. This will be done through analysis of semi-structured interviews with these stakeholders."
"9498972","Convergence of myeloid susceptibility protein function in Alzheimer?s disease Alzheimer?s disease is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline and dementia. Genome-wide association studies and sequencing studies have identified novel Alzheimer?s disease susceptibility loci. Interestingly the associated genes at several of these loci implicate the immune system in late-onset Alzheimer?s disease, specifically the innate immune system. However, how the majority of the proteins derived from these genetically associated loci actually function in immune cells is still unknown, especially in the context of Alzheimer?s disease. We have identified eight genetically associated proteins, which may be working together in a tyrosine phosphorylation signaling pathway in innate immune cells. For this application, we propose a multifaceted approach to 1) identify the interacting proteins of these eight Alzheimer?s disease genetically associated proteins, which we believe function together in microglia, and for which we already have strong supporting evidence of a shared pathway 2) validate that the proteins are phosphorylated and that the interactions occur in situ in the Alzheimer?s disease brain, and finally 3) Dissect the signaling pathway in vitro to understand functional outcomes and pinpoint intervention points."

"9559375","Project Summary Severe sepsis strikes more than a million patients in USA per year and it has been estimated that between 28% and 50% percent of these patients die, exceeding the number of U.S. deaths from prostate cancer, breast cancer and AIDS combined. Neonatal sepsis causes over one million death per year worldwide and 5% to 60% of infants treated with antibiotics die despite the treatment, with higher rates occurring in low income countries. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of sepsis in NICUs (Neonatal Intensive Care Units) is crucial for implementing a timely treatment. Because sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency a large proportion of infants receive treatment with potent systemic antibiotics that can adversely lead to destruction of the infant?s normal gastrointestinal flora and the risk of becoming colonized with drug-resistant microorganisms. Blood culturing is used as the gold standard for neonatal diagnosis of sepsis, however the samples are returned after 48 hrs which often does not provide timely results for neonatal sepsis treatment. Multiple sampling that will increase accuracy of neonatal diagnosis by culturing is minimized because the iatrogenic blood loss may represent up to 12% - 31% of total blood in premature babies. New point-of-care methods with faster detection time and more accurate to use smaller amounts of sample are urgently needed. Molecular DNA-based assays have been introduced into the CDC Guidelines for neonatal sepsis diagnosis but current methods lack accuracy, need enrichment of samples and cannot provide the needed multiplexed pathogen identification. However, today 90% of hospitals in USA and world cannot perform DNA analysis and samples are sent to the centralized reference labs with the response time of 2-3 days. The current point-of-care diagnostics are mostly based on the real-time PCR methods that are limited by the number of colors for detecting multiple organisms or by the high price of the instrument or assay cost. This project introduces a new point-of-care (POC) rapid method for DNA/RNA diagnostics that will approach total assay turn-around time of ~15-20 min and that can use very small sample volumes, as low as 5 - 200 microliters, compatible with the neonatal sepsis detection. Multiplexed identification of the neonatal sepsis pathogens is enabled using the microarray approach. The proposed technology will enable a new diagnostic approach that could more rapidly identify neonatal pathogens including hospital associated infections and antibiotic resistant pathogens yielding a more tailored administration of regimen of antibiotics and promoting a judicious use of antibiotics. Several innovations in manufacturing of cartridge disposable and instrument will bring a 5-8-fold decrease in the cost of instrumentation and cartridges compared to the commercialized platforms. The Phase II project will focus on the platform and neonatal sepsis/HAI assay development; however, it is envisioned that the platform will find other broad applications in decentralized, urgent care settings as well as in hospitals."
"9503938","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Apicomplexan parasites are among the most common and deadly pathogens of humans. For example, T. gondii infects an estimated 25% of the world's population and Plasmodium spp. contributes to nearly one million deaths each year. A key feature of apicomplexans is their ability to survive in a wide variety of environments as they transfer between hosts or enter and exit host cells. The wide range of cells that these parasites can infect reflects the plasticity of their metabolism, which undoubtedly evolved to allow their survival within the diverse host niches they colonize. Mitochondria are the metabolic hubs of the eukaryotic cell. Reactions within the mitochondria must adapt to the available carbon sources and the cellular energetic needs. Apicomplexan parasites possess a single mitochondrion responsible for these processes. Within the mitochondria, the ATP synthase couples the proton- motive force generated by respiration to ATP synthesis and thus plays a key role in metabolic plasticity. However, sequence-based searches have failed to identify several key subunits of the ATP synthase in the genome of apicomplexans. This exemplifies how the ATP synthase, and mitochondrial function in general, are poorly understood aspects of apicomplexan biology. The goal of this proposal is to identify the missing components of the apicomplexan ATP synthase by using T. gondii as a model and understand the role that this enzyme plays in mitochondrial physiology. The proposed project also aims to isolate mitochondria from T. gondii, paving the way to an unprecedented inventory of its proteins, DNA, and lipids. Characterizing the ATP synthase as well as determining a mitochondrial metabolome will be of broad interest to the fields of molecular parasitology. These studies will open new perspectives on the divergent apicomplexan metabolism and provide opportunities to develop urgently needed anti-parasitic therapies."
"9617162","PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia worldwide. Increasing age is the major risk of AD but the mechanisms are not clear. Genetic factors also contribute to increased susceptibility for AD including variations in immune-related genes including TREM2, Complement receptor 1 (CR1) and CD33; however, the role of the immune system AD has also not been determined. The complement cascade, part of innate immunity, has been strongly implicated in AD pathogenesis and inhibiting complement components has been shown to lessen AD- relevant phenotypes in multiple mouse models of AD. Our data suggests that complement-expressing myeloid cells (resident microglia and/or infiltrating macrophages) actively prune synapses and cause glia-vascular breakdown during aging and early AD. We have developed specific resources to test the role of complement in AD. We have developed the first conditional allele for C1qa to enable genetic ablation of C1qa in specific cell types. Furthermore, to achieve our goals, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team that includes neuroscientists, immunologists and computational biologists from Harvard University and The Jackson Laboratory. We will use genomic, molecular and imaging approaches to fully characterize C1QA+ myeloid cells in aging and AD mouse models. We will also use genetic and pharmacological approaches to determine whether these cells play beneficial or damaging roles in aging and AD. We have three aims: In Aim 1 we will characterize immune cells in relation to vascular compromise and synapse loss in aging and AD. Our preliminary data suggests that vascular compromise and myeloid activation are critical age-related events that contribute to an increased susceptibility to AD. To test this, we will spatially and temporally characterize C1QA+ myeloid cells by both transcriptional profiling and the use of transgenic reporter strains. To functional test the importance of vascular compromise and myeloid activation in AD, we will use an acute A? model in young and aged mice. In Aim 2, we will examine whether C1QA+ myeloid cells actively prune synapses in aging and AD. Our data strongly supports a role for microglia (and other myeloid cells) in pruning synapses during very early stages of AD. We also predict this pruning occurs during aging, increasing susceptibility for developing AD. We will use 3D two- photon imaging in awake, behaving mice to test whether microglia actively engulf intact synapses when challenged with A? oligomers and whether they engulf specific synapses targeted by A?. We will also determine whether age increases the risk of aberrant synaptic pruning by microglia and whether engulfing cells are of resident or peripheral origin. In Aim 3, we will specifically test whether myeloid or neuronal C1qa plays damaging or protective role(s) in vascular compromise and synapse loss. We will use a combination of genetic (conditional KO for C1qa) and pharmacological (complement C1q blocking antibody) in aged mice and multiple models relevant to AD to explore the potential of targeting C1q as a treatment for AD."
"9464959","Alcohol use disorder (AUD) contributes significantly to disease burden and mortality in the United States, with an annual healthcare cost of $223 billion and a death toll of nearly 88,000. Current methods to assess alcohol intake rely primarily on self-report surveys or biochemical measures of liver injury. However, these methods are rather insensitive and unreliable since subjects are often not forthcoming and liver injury is not the only indication of ethanol-mediated organ damage, which includes increased incidence of gastrointestinal cancers and exacerbation of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Moreover, alcohol consumption affects human health in a dose-dependent manner; light to moderate drinkers have a lower risk of all-cause mortality than abstainers while heavy drinkers are at the highest risk. Similarly, alcohol consumption modulates immunity in a dose-dependent manner. Specifically, AUD results in poor response to vaccination, enhanced susceptibility to infection, and poor wound healing, whereas moderate ethanol consumption leads to improved vaccine responses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop sensitive, robust, non-invasive markers of ethanol consumption. Extracellular RNA (exRNA) serves as efficient biomarkers of cancer, cardiovascular risk, liver injury and placental dysfunction. These exRNA circulate either packaged within exosomes, or bound to lipoproteins or other proteins, making them very stable. Given the role cellular miRNAs play in regulating gene expression following alcohol exposure, their potential to provide reliable biomarkers of ethanol consumption is high. However, our current understanding of alcohol-induced changes in exRNA is limited to a few exosome- bound microRNAs, which are increased in circulation in alcoholic liver disease models or after in vitro treatment of monocytes with rather high doses of ethanol. Thus, there is a crucial need to uncover additional dose-sensitive exosome-bound miRNA as well as identify miRNA cargo bound to protein and lipoproteins. In this application, we will address this critical gap in knowledge by first identifying ethanol-mediated changes in extracellular microRNA (ex-miRNA) bound to exosomes, lipoproteins, and proteins by leveraging a robust nonhuman primate model of voluntary chronic (12 months) ethanol self-administration in combination with a novel RNA-Differential Isolation Platform (RNA-DIP) and next generation sequencing. Additionally, we will test the functional impact of over-represented miRNA packaged in exosomes and delivered into monocytes from ethanol naïve animals. We will assess the downstream effect of miRNA uptake by stimulating the cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and measuring both changes in transcription and protein levels of inflammatory mediators. These experiments will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Grant who developed the voluntary ethanol self-administration model, Dr. Zhong who developed the RNA-DIP chip to simultaneously isolate all three exRNA fractions, and Dr. Zhao who bears expertise in manipulating stem cell behavior by delivering exosome-bound miRNA. Completion of the studies proposed in this application will yield unprecedented insight into ethanol dose-dependent alterations in exRNA cargo, their potential role as biomarkers of ethanol consumption, and their impact on inflammation."
"9495615","PROJECT SUMMARY Port Wine Stain (PWS) is a congenital, progressive vascular malformation of human skin which occurs in an estimated incidence of 3-5 infants per 1,000 live births. Approximately 1.2 million individuals in the United States have PWS birthmarks. Pulsed dye laser (PDL) remains the choice of treatment for PWS. However, only less than 10% of patients achieve complete lesion fading after PDL. Inadequate PWS therapeutic outcome is a clinically significant problem that requires an urgent solution. The etiology and pathogenesis of PWS are currently poorly understood. This knowledge gap is a major obstacle for developing any new effective treatments. PWS is one of the research areas under the NIAMS long-range plan listed as ?understanding the cause of skin vasculature birth defects (e.g., hemangioma and port wine stain) and developing effective therapies.? The studies proposed herein are specifically directed towards understanding pathological mechanisms of PWS and facilitating the development of new, more effective approaches to treatment. In searching for causative substances for PWS, we have identified that circulating CD31+ exosomes, which are derived from human lesional dermal microvascular endothelial cells (hDMVECs), facilitate the formation of vascular phenotypes of PWS. Analysis of the protein content of the serum CD31+ exosomes reveals that PWS CD31+ exosomes harbor a unique molecular milieu that include EphB1, ephrinB2 (EfnB2), a-disintegrin-and- metalloprotease domain 30 (ADAM30), and exocytosis mediator synatotagamin like-1 (SYTL1). Functional analysis shows ADAM30 functions as a sheddase to cleave EfnB2 and its activity is regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling. More interestingly, compared to normal controls, PWS serum CD31+ exosomes and hDMVEC culture-derived EphB1/EfnB2/ADAM30 exosomes possess much greater angiogenesis activity. They greatly increased the number and size of new blood vessels formed in a nude mouse xenograft model in vivo. These novel findings motivate us to test a hypothesis that hDMVEC- derived CD31+ exosomes enrich at lesional sites and cause the development and progression of PWS via disruption of cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions and EC barrier function through a molecular pathway involving exosomal EphB1/EfnB2/ADAM30 (Fig. 1). These exosomes are also released into the circulatory system where they can be identified and serve as potential serum biomarkers. In Aim 1, we will determine the specific molecular profiles of CD31+ exosomes derived from PWS ECs as compared to normal controls in vitro and in vivo. We will determine if secretion of CD31+ exosomes from PWS hDMVECs is regulated by exocytosis genes SYTL1 and synatotagamin-1 (SYT1) in vivo and in vitro; In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms by which EphB1/EfnB2 regulates VEGFR2 signaling to activate ADAM30 leading to subsequent EfnB2 cleavage; in Aim 3, we will determine if PWS CD31+ exosomal EphB1/EfnB2/ADAM30 induces the formation of PWS vascular phenotypes in vitro; and in Aim 4, we will determine if PWS CD31+ exosomal EphB1/EfnB2/ADAM30 induces angiogenesis and formation of PWS vascular phenotypes in vivo. The long- term goal of this research is to investigate the pathogenesis of PWS for developing new treatments of PWS. The immediate goal is to establish the role of lesional endothelial exosomes in the vascular phenotypes in the pathogenesis of PWS. Our proposed studies are totally novel and data so obtained will be important since they will define a novel molecular pathway for the pathogenesis of PWS and open new avenues for the development of more effective therapeutic strategies for PWS."

"9540723","Abstract Genome maintenance in the germline is vital for fertility and the health of offspring. Although DNA damage response (DDR) and repair has been well characterized in meiocytes, the DDR pathway(s) that function in primordial germ cells (PGCs), which are the precursors to sperm and eggs, have not been identified. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genomic instability syndrome associated with PGC depletion and infertility in addition to some other devastating clinical manifestations such as bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition. The FA pathway is a major DDR pathway known to function in double-strand DNA break repair. The signaling mechanisms underlying PGC depletion and infertility in FA patients or mouse models are not known. We recently developed Flag- and hemagglutinin-tagged Fancd2 knock-in mice that allowed a high throughput mass spectrometry approach to search for Fancd2-binding proteins in different mouse organs. In addition to DDR partners, we observed several proteins of the germ-cell-specific Prmt5/piRNA pathways orchestrating the repression of transposable elements (TEs). Deletion of Fancd2 resulted in decreased protein levels of the Prmt5/piRNA factors, massive upregulation of TEs, PGC depletion, and led to defective spermatogenesis and oogenesis in Fancd2-null (Fancd2-KO) mice. These preliminary studies suggest that in addition to its well-established DNA repair roles, Fancd2 and the FA pathway has an in vivo TE silencing function in early-stage germ cells. We hypothesize that the FA pathway is essential for germline integrity involving a pathway hierarchy in which the FA core signals to Fancd2, which then guides Prmt5 and piRNA in TE silencing. The goals of the project are to establish functional interaction between the FA pathway and germ cell- specific TE silencing machinery in safeguarding the germline genome, and to define Fancd2 as a crucial regulator of this vital epigenetic programming during germ cell development.  The project presents an innovative study aimed at linking a major DDR pathway to germline genome maintenance in early-stage germ cells. The knowledge gained from the proposed study will not only improve mechanistic understanding of the molecular collaboration between the FA DDR pathway and the Prmt5/piRNA pathway in the context of TE repression, but also lead to a new avenue of research designed to target these interacting pathways for developing innovative therapeutic strategies for reproductive diseases such as infertility and birth defects."
"9462625","The overall goal of this collaborative project is to develop a ?Defend and Destroy? strategy for the functional cure of HIV infection in which a patient's CD4+ T cells are rendered resistant to HIV infection (?Defend?) while simultaneously strategies are applied to eliminate viral reservoirs (?Destroy?). The ?Defend? portion of this strategy is based upon the ?Berlin Patient,? who was cured of HIV infection upon receipt of a bone marrow transplant from a donor harboring a null mutation in the CCR5 gene, which encodes a co-receptor essential for HIV infection. Although transplantation with CCR5 null hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is theoretically an attractive treatment strategy for HIV, in practice allogeneic bone marrow transplants from CCR5-null donors are not a viable strategy for treating HIV in the general population due to limited donor availability and the risks associated with the procedure, particularly graft vs. host disease. Here, we propose to harness the power of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system to introduce null mutations in CCR5 in a patient's own hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), thereby allowing for an autologous transplant and a functional cure of HIV without many of the risks associated with an allogeneic transplant. The success of the proposed strategy hinges upon the recently discovered CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system, which is a highly customizable and has the on-target efficiency needed to mutate both copies of CCR5 in a high percentage of the target cell population. As the first step towards full clinical translation of the ?Defend and Destroy? strategy, the company CRISPR Therapeutics Ltd, the private-sector partner in this application, will transition strategies for disrupting CCR5 in HSCs developed in the academic laboratory (see Project 1) towards clinical application through the execution of two specific aims: 1) Development of a process for genetically modifying human HSCs compliant with applicable regulations governing cell-based medicinal products; and 2) Analysis of pharmacology, biodistribution, toxicology and off-target effects of genetically modified HSCs. The accomplishment of these two aims will ready this technology for a first-in-humans clinical trial, and will provide the basis for a long-term functional cure of HIV. More broadly, these studies will establish a basic clinic-ready platform upon which other elements of the overall strategy such as non-toxic conditioning regimens (Project 3) and strategies to enhance HSC homing or destruction of viral reservoirs (Projects 1 and 2) can be added. More broadly, the methods developed here for conducting GMP-compliant gene editing in HSCs will have widespread applicability to a variety of genetic diseases of the blood.  "
"9508013","Project Summary / Abstract Motor axon output is controlled by Renshaw cells forming an inhibitory feedback circuit with spinal motoneurons that was first described by Birdsey Renshaw in 1941. Since then a large number of investigators have defined Renshaw cells connectivity, electrophysiological properties, actions on spinal motoneurons and interneurons and more recently their development and molecular genetics. However, up to date there is no consensus about how this recurrent inhibitory feedback circuit alters motor output, ongoing movement and motor actions. This gap in knowledge is important especially considering that the recurrent inhibitory circuit has been shown to fail in patients with high levels of spasticity due to stroke, spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or hereditary spastic paresis. The P.I. also recently discovered that this circuit is disconnected in animal models of ALS and participated in a study that involucrate Renshaw cell dysfunction in Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is clearly necessary to reexamine the exact role this circuit plays on the output of motor commands from the spinal cord. In this proposal we leverage new knowledge on the molecular biology and genetics of the Renshaw cell to develop animal models for specific silencing these cells in adult. We propose to use commercially available mouse models in a genetic intersectional approach based on co-expression of the parvalbumin (Pvalb) and calbindin (Calb1) genes and taking advantage of mice in which we can direct expression of reporter proteins, GiDREADDs or tetanus toxin under a dual conditional strategy based on co- expression of both cre and flp, each recombinase respectively dependent on Calb1 and Pvalb. We will also test new scAVV9 vectors for directing expression of dual conditional transgenes specifically in spinal cord neurons. The aims of this exploratory R21 proposal is to develop and validate these models in Aims 1 and 2 and then use them to test the role of Renshaw cells mediated recurrent inhibition in desynchronization of motor output to diminish physiological tremor during muscle contractions (Aim 3). Validation of this animal model will be of great use to test in the future classical and new theories on Renshaw cells function and also their involvement in different diseases of the spinal cord motor system."
"9456522","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will explore a novel hypothesis that arose from our unexpected observation that superimposing muscle paralysis upon exogenous mechanical loading of bone greatly augments the osteogenic response to loading. These data directly challenge a central paradigm in the field, which reflects the consensus that, from the tissue to molecular levels, muscle and bone atrophy and hypertrophy in parallel. Our preliminary studies further demonstrated that the location of the paralyzed muscle relative to the loaded bone did not alter this response, confirming that a circulating factor was responsible for mediating the enhanced anabolism. Our subsequent studies have revealed a candidate for coupling muscle atrophy and bone anabolism, microRNA 206 (mir-206). Consistent with the rapidly expanding literature regarding cell-to-cell signaling via exosomal microRNA and the demonstrated ability of mir-206 to suppress histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) which, in turn, enhances osteoblast differentiation, we hypothesize that: muscle paralysis transiently upregulates exosomal mir-206 which, via suppression of HDAC4, enhances osteoblast differentiation and function. We will pursue this thesis through four closely related S. Aims, each with a corresponding sub- hypothesis. The in vivo experiments of S. Aims #1 and #2 are designed to demonstrate that cellular signaling induced by muscle paralysis transiently enhances ongoing osteoblast differentiation and function via exosomes within the serum, that the observed anabolic augmentation can be achieved independently of loading induced osteoblast activation, and that the response can be induced in both trabecular and cortical bone. We will use in vitro approaches to confirm that exosomal mir-206 serves to enhance osteoblast differentiation and function by suppressing translation of HDAC4 (S. Aim #3) and we will demonstrate that downstream in vivo targeting of this pathway (via HDAC4 inhibition) is able to replicate enhanced bone anabolism without the necessity of inducing muscle paralysis (S. Aim #4). If the project is successful, we believe these data would fundamentally alter our conceptualization of how muscle and bone interact at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels and would enable novel targeting of this pathway as an eventual clinical intervention capable of enhancing bone morphology."
"9518005","Project Summary Affecting over 1% of the world?s population, including 3 million Americans, schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by an array of symptoms including hallucinations, delusions, difficulty expressing emotions, and deficits in attention and memory. Despite the currently available antipsychotics, patients suffering schizophrenia have a life expectancy 10 years lower than that of the general population, are prone to substance abuse, homelessness, and are at risk of suicide. As a result, both the toll exacted on the lives of individuals suffering from the disorder and the public health costs are substantial. There is currently no cure for schizophrenia, and research into the causes of the disease, including the anatomical and physiological disruptions in the brain, has been difficult because little is known about the underlying pathology of cells in patients.  To elucidate the anatomical and physiological deficits found in the patients with schizophrenia, this proposal will develop a novel model for the disorder by transplanting reprogrammed human induced- Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) into an animal system and imaging the structure and function of these cells in vivo. In Aim 1, this project will develop the technologies needed to perform structural characteriation of human iPSC-derived neurons including developing methods to analyze neural circuit structure and anatomical dynamics. In Aim 2, this project will develop technologies needed to image the population calcium activity of human iPSC-derived neurons in vivo and develop new analysis methods for studying and characterizing this acitivity. In Aim 3, this project will apply these technologies to characterize the structure and spontaneous activity patterns of human iPSC-derived neurons in vivo. Taken together, this work will develop a powerful new platform for dissecting the structure and function of human neural circuits with the aims of understanding the neurobiological basis of schizophrenia."
"9461535","Project Summary: The impact of changes in visual input on neuronal circuitry is complex and much of our knowledge of plasticity in the visual system comes from animal studies. While these studies have started to highlight the specific neural underpinnings responsible for visual cortex plasticity in response to visual impairment, restored vision and environment interactions, similar studies have not been possible in humans due to the unethical invasiveness of the procedures involved. Having access to a group of well-characterized subjects with Leber?s Congenital Amaurosis due to RPE65 mutations (LCA2) who will participate in an LCA2 Phase 3 clinical trial provides the unique opportunity to study this process in blind humans who gain vision through gene therapy (GT). We hope to draw parallels between cortical plasticity changes reported in animal studies with reverse eye-lid suture (regaining sight) and human retinal GT in LCA patients (gaining sight). Noninvasive brain imaging before and after intervention in these subjects will provide us the opportunity to not only study the effects of regaining vision on the human brain and the underlying mechanisms of plasticity, but also to bring focus on alternate visual pathways used by the LCA2 patients before GT. One such pathway appears to utilize intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells (ipRGC) and one question is whether there is a relative change in retinal signaling to the brain after GT.  To our knowledge this will be the first longitudinal study to combine structural and functional neuroimaging techniques to examine and gain a deeper understanding of the process of brain plasticity in humans in vivo, focusing on a large group of individuals born with severe visual impairment with measurements before and after an intervention that restores vision.  The Phase 3 LCA clinical trial will enroll 24 patients, including 8 randomly assigned to be followed for one year before receiving GT. All subjects will undergo imaging consisting of sub-millimeter 3D structural imaging, and a powerful new method of diffusion MRI (dMRI) that provides microstructural information reflecting degree of dendritic sprouting and myelination. These tests will provide detailed assessment of the changes of the visual cortex in response to GT. Primary and higher visual functions will also be measured in all subjects using a battery of functional MRI (fMRI) paradigms. Visual function will be assessed separately, during the Phase 3 clinical trial and data will be made available to this study. The visual function data will then be correlated with the CNS imaging and visual function data.  Completion of this project will provide important temporal-spatial data on the degree of neuroplasticity of the human visual system and the role it plays in enhancement of visual function following GT. These data may have future potential application to studies evaluating gene therapy-mediated reversal of blindness."
"9452107","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory refers to the ability to hold information in mind, to manipulate it, and to use it to guide behavior. It is an elemental cognitiv function that supports such high-level abilities as planning, problem solving, and language comprehension and production; it is an important factor underlying individual differences across a broad spectrum of experimental and real world measures of human performance; and its dysfunction is characteristic of many psychiatric and neurological diseases. The overarching goal of the present proposal is to address the question how does working memory work? by focusing on the role of attention. Building on findings from the previous funding cycle of this project, we propose to investigate the contributions, and boundary conditions, of attentional mechanisms to working memory performance, by pursuing the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that common attention-related factors underlie the selection of an object, or a feature, in both attention and working memory tasks. In vision, top-down attentional priority is implemented via the mechanism of biased competition among neural representations of stimuli in the scene. In Experiments 1-4, we will use multivariate analysis methods to first characterize the temporal dynamics of biased competition in visual search, then perform head-to-head comparisons of the effects of attentional prioritization in visual search vs. in visual working memory. Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the state of neural activation of `attended memory items' and of `unattended memory items' varies with strategic factors. Is it possible to definitively dissociate the neural bases of focusing attention on information held in working memory vs. the retention of this information when it is momentarily outside of the focus of attention? To address this question we will systematically vary two factors to which visual search is sensitive: the validity of retrocues; and the trial-to-trial predictability of the search target. Specific Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that activity in the intraparietal sulcus implements the context- appropriate control of attention in working memory. Although elevated delay-period activity is frequently observed in the dorsal frontoparietal control network during working memory tasks, research published during the previous funding period has challenged the notion that this activity corresponds to the storage, per se, of stimulus information. The experiments pursing this Aim will assess the idea that IPS functions as an amodal priority map that tracks and manages the priority status of items that are relevant for the current trial."
"9499645","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Dopamine is a key modulator of motivated behavior. Dopamine is also a key modulator of reinforcement- driven learning. Yet the relationship between these critical functions is unclear. Based on seminal recordings of dopamine cells in head-fixed animals, the dominant theory is that dopamine signals reward prediction errors - i.e. a learning signal. However, the actual release of dopamine has been repeatedly found to escalate as freely-moving animals approach rewards, in a manner more consistent with reward prediction than reward prediction errors. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of dopamine immediately invigorates behavior, as if boosting reward predictions.  This project seeks to resolve this apparent discrepancy, and gain a new understanding of dopamine signaling and regulation. Prior studies in brain slices have established that dopamine release is strongly influenced by local mechanisms, especially nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopamine terminals. Aim 1 will directly test whether there is a dissociation between dopamine firing and dopamine release. VTA dopamine cell body activity will be assessed using both optogenetic identification of single neurons, and fiber photometry, and dopamine terminal activity in accumbens core and shell will be measured using both fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and fiber photometry. These measures will be taken as rats perform multiple behavioral tasks, including a trial-and-error reinforcement learning task and a more passive Pavlovian task for better comparison to prior studies. Aim 2 will monitor and manipulate accumbens cholinergic interneurons during the same behavioral tasks, while examining dopamine terminal activity. The hypothesis is that these interneurons can both shape the motivational message conveyed by dopamine release, and rapidly switch this message to a reinforcement learning signal. Finally, Aim 3 will use variably-timed local optogenetic manipulations of dopamine and accumbens spiny neuron subpopulations (direct vs indirect) to investigate the exact timing requirements for dopamine to serve as a reinforcement learning signal.  The long-term goal of this research program is to understand circuit mechanisms of adaptive decision- making, and how drugs such as nicotine perturb these mechanisms to produce addictive behavior. By using state-of-the-art techniques and carefully-designed behavioral tasks to test novel hypotheses, this project may transform our understanding of the neurobiology of motivated behavior."
"9462857","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to PAR-14-304, NIMH Mentoring Networks for Mental Health Research Education, this application seeks five years of support to build, maintain, and sustain an innovative mentoring network for implementation science in mental health. This network will extend in creative new ways the Implementation Research Institute (IRI, NIMH R25 funding 2009-2015), which has successfully trained 43 new mental health implementation researchers. Implementation science is critical for mental health where most Americans with mental disorder receive sub-optimal care due in large part to challenges in the implementation, sustainability, and scale-up of evidence-treatments. Training demand far outweighs supply but only a handful of programs train implementation researchers and only the IRI in mental health. Therefore we seek a one-time, five-year renewal of IRI to pursue three aims: to (1) develop a mentoring network of faculty and Fellows who will advance the science and lead the field of mental health implementation research; (2) evaluate outcomes of the IRI mentoring network, inform continued improvement to training, and derive new knowledge about the role of mentoring networks in accelerating collaboration, scholarly productivity and research training; and (3) extend training benefits to the broader field by disseminating lessons learned, training models, and tools for creating sustainable mentoring networks. To achieve aim 1, we will conduct an innovative, continually renewed annual summer institute; foster networked collaboration and mentoring; prepare IRI Fellows to mentor others in their home institutions, thus extending and sustaining IRI's reach and impact; and use learning visits to federally funded implementation research sites to help Fellows connect IRI training to team based, real-world science. Evaluation methods will include bibliometrics and social network analysis, with outcomes including mentoring effectiveness, collaboration, and scholarly products (publications and grant proposals). IRI will provide innovative training at the forefront of implementation science to 24 new researchers (six in four two-year cohorts). New Fellows will be networked with past Fellows, Core Faculty, and Expert Faculty to spur collaboration and foster scholarly innovation. Their research will accelerate innovation in the implementation science and inform sustainable improvements to mental health care-thereby reducing the burden of mental illness for countless individuals and families. IRI Fellows will be well prepared for Three T Science--team, translational, trans-disciplinary-called for by the Investing in the Future report (National Advisory Mental Health Council Workgroup on Research Training). Fellows will advance the field through their scholarship and will lead the next generation of implementation researchers in mental health. Objectives of the NIMH strategic plan cannot be achieved without advances in implementation science for mental health, where disease burden is high, the repertoire of effective treatments is growing, but availability and receipt of evidence- based care is low."
"9457217","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroinflammation is now regarded to be a contributing factor in the etiology of a wide range of psychiatric disorders and a potential mediator of the extensive co-morbidities that are present between these disorders. It has been suggested that psychiatric disorders may result when normal neuroinflammatory responses to stimuli that induce these responses become exaggerated. The experience of both acute and more chronic stressors also are associated with the development of a number of disorders. It has been tempting to suppose that these two processes are related, but neither acute nor chronic stress have proved to produce persistent neuroinflammation beyond the stressor exposure. However, we have recently found that both acute and chronic stressors, even though they do not produce either large or long-lasting neuroinflammation, potently exaggerate neuroinflammatory responses to both peripheral and central inflammatory stimuli that are administered later. Importantly, this sensitized neuroinflammatory reaction persists for many days after stressor exposure. However, the mechanisms that lead stressors to sensitize subsequent neuroinflammation remain largely unknown.  Within the past decade there has been a revolution in understanding the mechanisms involved in mediating peripheral innate immunity/inflammation. These new mechanisms and processes have been studied almost exclusively in the periphery, and whether or not they occur in the CNS is unknown. Our Preliminary Studies strongly encourage the possibility that these are present in CNS innate immune cells (microglia) and that they are involved in mediating stress-induced sensitization of neuroinflammatory responses to subsequent inflammatory challenges. The global goals of the proposed research are to a) firmly establish the presence of these processes, heretofore unstudied in brain, in brain, and b) explore the role of these processes in stress- induced sensitization of neuroinflammation, as well as the behavioral changes that typically induced by the activation of innate immune cells in the brain."
"9462228","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression is a common and serious disorder among pregnant women but few from low income groups receive effective treatment. The highly evidence based collaborative care (CC) model for depression has been shown to work for women in pregnancy but has not been widely implemented. In cases where large scale pragmatic implementation of this innovation has been attempted there has been great variation in the success at individual health centers. A major obstacle to achieving the same success in large scale efforts to implement this care innovation as is seen in more controlled effectiveness trials is the limit of resources available to support the staff members carrying out this care. Although ongoing support in the form of training, technical assistance, quality improvement, and tools has been found to improve implementation and patient outcomes through longitudinal consultation by content experts in the health innovation being implemented most implementation efforts rely primarily on brief intensive training for staff. These content experts are complementary but distinct from general practice facilitators that address general processes that are applicable to implementation of any innovation. In order to achieve the potential public health benefits of CC an efficient and scalable model of longitudinal consultation may be needed to facilitate its effective implementation. We propose a pragmatic cluster randomized trial of longitudinal remote consultation (LRC) utilizing video conferencing to efficiently link providers to consultants who provide timely feedback and training. We plan to use a Hybrid Type III implementation design with a focus on implementation outcomes but also clinical outcomes. The proposed study will involve twenty federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) providing prenatal care and which are part of the national OCHIN Network with a shared electronic health record. All sites will receive a standard multifaceted approach to implementation used in many current broad implementation efforts. After pre-implementation training ten of the sites will be randomly selected to receive the LRC. Implementation and clinical outcomes as well as costs will be compared between the study conditions after a 12 month implementation period and a 13-21 month sustainment period. The results of the proposed study will provide critical generalizable knowledge regarding the benefits of ongoing consultation for implementation of complex interventions like collaborative care."

The leadership and faculty of Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) and Universidad Nacional de la Amazonia Peruana (UNAP) have systematically delineated research priorities for this program in the next project period. This training program will continu to emphasize degree granting programs-MS and PhD) at UPCH and UNAP, and supplemented by diverse short- and medium-term training of postdoctoral scholars, students (undergraduate, post-baccalaureate), nurses, and technicians. The program explicitly understands that research capacity at UPCH and UNAP differs, and that UPCH has an important leadership opportunity to leverage its achievements to enhance UNAP's research success in Iquitos, Peru, while continuing to advance its institutional priorities in Lima. Sustainability is a key priority of this proposed renewal, with emphasis on grant and manuscript writing. Submission of new grant applications to newly available governmental funding opportunities in Peru is an important priority. The new project period proposes to emphasize recruitment on new trainees from underrepresented groups in Peru particularly in the Amazon region (via UNAP). With new and ongoing NIH-funded and Peruvian government-funded research projects focused on malaria and leptospirosis, this training program is designed to build upon past capacity building success to bring laboratory- and field-based research capacity in-country in Peru. The general scientific infrastructure and environment created by the current research projects will explicitly be leveraged to other diseases areas of articulated local priorit. Training in Peru (Lima, Iquitos/Amazon region) training will be the primary activities, supplemented by training of a small number of highly selected candidates for either short- or long-term training at the University in California (San Diego and Davis). Such training will be explicitly targeted at prioritized areas (i.e not available in Peru) by the UPCH and UNAP faculty-based Executive Committee. The new project period will include specific new areas of emphasis, including short-, medium- and long-term training in the following: medical entomology, laboratory animal science, pathogen genomics and bioinformatics, cell biology/microscopy techniques and innovative data management). A highly qualified faculty with international reputations has been assembled at UPCH in Lima and at the University of California (San Diego and Davis), supplemented by microbial bioinformatics from the J. Craig Venter Institute, which will be coordinated by the program leadership. Motivated scientists in the context of excellent research facilities at UNAP in Iquitos will leverage the UPCH and international faculty to advance research capacity building in Iquitos. Our goals are summarized as the advancement of two key institutions in Peru by developing the next generation of scientists for leadership in the international scientific community as well as in their home country."
"9482564","Abstract Objective of this proposal is to determine clinical potentials for low-level laser therapy (LLLT) of neonatal thrombocytopenia (NATP). NATP can be caused by a variety of etiology and places newborns at a high risk of intracranial hemorrhage. No drugs or therapies are currently available for NATP in general, apart from platelet transfusion. We recently discovered that whole body illumination with low power, near infrared lasers at specific settings could vigorously enhance platelet regeneration in both adult and neonatal mice with a severe platelet drop. LLLT accelerated and enhanced proplatelet formation in polyploid megakaryocytes (MKs) by bolstering not only mitochondrial biogenesis but also mitochondrial activity, resulting in a significantly higher rate of platelets generated from individual MKs. Noninvasive whole body LLLT alleviated thrombocytopenia and normalized bleeding times in multiple thrombo- cytopenia murine models, concurrent with improved homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. In this proposal, we will corroborate LLLT's ability to increase platelet production in umbilical cord human CD34+ stem cells (cHSCs) ex vivo and elucidate the underlying mechanism. We will then stimulate local platelet biogenesis by a newly engineered LLL device called E-plate (Enhancer of platelets) in newborn piglets with different skin colors, at various anatomic locations, and in varying times. Finally, allo-immune thrombocytopenia as a model NATP will be induced in newborn piglets, which are similar in size to human newborns, by daily injection of anti-platelet antibody. Therapeutic efficacy of LLL will be evaluated in the piglets by whole body or liver alone illumination using either multiple E-plates or a single E-plate. The proposed studies could provide valuable information with respect to light penetration, safety, and clinical potentials of the newly engineered E-plate. This drug-free, painless, safe, and noninvasive modality, if successful, could significantly reduce the number of platelet transfusions in newborns with severe thrombocytopenia and greatly improve the outcome of infant cares in the neonatal intensive care unit."
"9460366","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The myotonias and periodic paralyses are heritable diseases of skeletal muscle in which mutations of voltage-gated ion channels alter the electrical excitability of the fiber. The long-term goals of this project are to characterize the functional defects of mutant channels in these disorders and to determine how abnormal channel behavior produces symptoms in affected individuals. In these disorders, muscle dysfunction is caused by intermittent derangements in the electrical excitability of the fiber, which may be pathologically enhanced or depressed. Myotonia is a disorder of enhanced excitability wherein a single stimulus elicits a high- frequency burst of action potentials that produces involuntary persistent muscle contraction lasting seconds. Conversely, periodic paralysis results from a depolarization -induced loss of muscle excitability. Missense mutations in the adult skeletal muscle sodium channel (NaV1.4) may cause myotonia, periodic paralysis, or a combination of both in the same individual. The pathophysiological basis for this variation in clinical phenotype, all arising from mutations in a common sodium channel gene is a major focus of the studies in this proposal.  Our experimental approach is to identify alterations in the behavior of mutant channels by measuring ionic current, and then use computer or animal-based models to explore how specific alterations in channel function give rise to myotonia or periodic paralysis. Aim 1 is to characterize the gating behavior of NaV1.4 channels, with a new focus on characterizing these properties for channels expressed in their native skeletal muscle environment. The availability of two mouse lines generated in our lab with knock-in point mutations in NaV1.4 (M1592V and R669H) offers a unique opportunity to characterize mutant channel behavior as occurs in muscle. Our studies on gating of disease- associated mutations of NaV1.4 will also explore the exciting new finding that missense mutations of arginines within S4 voltage-sensor domains may give rise to gating pore currents through an alternative permeation pathway different from the central pore. The propagation of action potentials into the transverse tubular system (TTS) and the activity-dependent accumulation of K+ therein are critical determinants of susceptibility to myotonia. Aim 2 will provide greater understanding for this important feature of muscle excitability by using state-of-the-art optical methods to measure TTS voltage transients and analytical models to estimate K+ accumulation both in normal mammalian muscle and for mouse models of myotonia and periodic paralysis. Aim 3 is a comparative analysis of the clinical phenotypes and electrophysiological properties of muscle from mice harboring either the M1592V or R669H mutations, as a model for gaining further insight on the mechanistic basis for the divergent phenotypes observed in humans for these allelic disorders of NaV1.4 (hyperkalemic periodic paralysis with myotonia contrasted by hypokalemic periodic paralysis without myotonia)."
"9520143","Project Summary/Abstract: Superfund site toxicants pose a significant hazard to human health, in part through their ability to alter patterns of gene expression. One of the most prevalent diseases, toxicant-associated steatohepatitis (TASH), is phenotypically similar to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) without the underlying obesity. Building on this similarity, this project will provide mechanistic insight into TASH-induced liver damage and models of exposure. With a focus on the epigenetic and immune responses, the overall goal of the project is to identify potential intervention or prevention therapies and/or therapeutic targets. In Aim 1 we will explore the role of regulatory enhancers, key genomic mediators of tissue fibrosis, in mouse models of TASH by mapping injury-induced epigenetic changes in stellate cells, hepatocytes, and immune cells. In parallel studies, the therapeutic efficacy of epigenetically-targeted small molecule modulators will be determined in both intervention and prevention models of TASH. In Aim 2 we will profile the immune response to toxicant-induced liver damage in mice during the initial injury, damage/repair, and resolution stages. Based on these findings, potential immune-targeted therapies for the treatment TAFLD and TASH will be explored. In Aim 3, the epigenetic and immunological consequences of chronic toxicant exposure will be explored in a novel genetic mouse model of TAFLD (SMRTRID mice). In summary, this project will provide valuable insight on the molecular mechanisms underlying TAFLD and TASH as well as a roadmap for potential new therapies."
"9597246","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic brain injury (TBI) accounts for more than 90,000 newly disabled persons annually in the USA with the upsurge in metabolic neuropathologies increasingly recognized to worsen outcomes. It is an alarming public health issue that more than 40% of the American population is affected by some metabolic disorder such as diabetes and obesity. Metabolic disorders are a risk factor for increased morbidity and predictors of death of TBI patients, and high sugar consumption, particularly fructose, is emerging as a main cause of metabolic disorders. Our preliminary results indicate that consumption of fructose disturbs important parameters of brain plasticity and can worsen the pathology of TBI. We would like to pursue these findings further to determine mechanisms by which fructose influences the capacity of the brain to cope with trauma. For example, the question as to whether fructose has direct effects on brain metabolism and cognitive function is largely uncharted, but the implications are paramount to employing strategies to enhance TBI recovery. Currently, insufficient understanding of how altered cellular metabolism affects brain function has limited the development of preventive programs and treatments. We have embarked on studies in rodents to determine crucial mechanisms by which metabolic perturbations disrupt the substrates for brain plasticity and function, underlying cognition. We will investigate the hypothesis that metabolic alterations carried by fructose impact important aspects of neuronal function and plasticity, which underlie cognitive performance (learning and memory) and emotional health (anxiety-like behaviors). Studies are also intended to obtain novel information how TBI influences main aspects of the metabolism of fructose in the brain, including fructose transporter, enzymatic activity, and metabolites. Although oxidative metabolism and plasma membrane homeostasis are inter-related events, this interaction is often overlooked. We will examine the concept that the plasma membrane is the main gate for transmission of information across the CNS, which can be damaged by the effects of fructose thereby reducing the threshold for the negative consequences of TBI. We will determine the capacity of dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to counteract the effects of fructose on synaptic plasticity and membrane function after TBI. DHA is a main component of the membrane; therefore, DHA has the magnificent power to regulate all forms of interneuronal signaling and the course of TBI. The successful completion of this proposal relies on our unique expertise in mechanisms by which metabolic challenges affect the substrates of brain plasticity and repair. We expect that mechanistic information provided by these interdisciplinary studies can nurture a new line of thought with regards to the menace of metabolic challenges on TBI and other neurological disorders, and foster new potential treatments."
"9477799","Contact PD/PI: Li, King C. Project Summary/Abstract A critical issue that impedes advances in public health is the chasm between what we know can improve health and what is implemented in everyday practice. In addition, to have the highest impact, diverse participants should be involved in all types of clinical and translational research, to ensure both the relevance of research findings to the general population and the likelihood that they can be disseminated to improve public health in a meaningful way. Finally, implementation of research findings requires that translational research occurs in an efficient and organized environment. All of these activities are critical to a learning health care system by providing the foundation for information feedback loops, team-based learning and investigation, stakeholder participation, opportunities for education, continuous improvement, and sustainability. The mission of the Wake Forest Translational Science Institute (TSI) is to provide an innovative, efficient, and sustainable research infrastructure to accelerate WF's transformation, and thus speed the translation of discoveries to improve health. The purpose of this Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) application is to synergize the fundamental positive changes that the TSI has already brought to bear at Wake Forest Baptist Health. The TSI has already made substantive progress to develop and augment our translational workforce; provide outstanding support in biostatistics, epidemiology, and research design; and assure that our research complies with regulatory guidelines and meets ethical standards. Our rapidly growing Clinically Integrated Network will aggregate data from our affiliates to provide an extraordinarily rich source of clinical information to inform new research directions, facilitated by our biomedical informatics expertise. We can offer to the CTSA network our resources and expertise in building efficient clinical research support programs and extensive experience in the conduct of multi-center clinical research, especially studies focused on older adults, in which our track record is exemplary. The TSI also has model programs in community engagement, team science, and recruitment of special populations into translational research. We propose novel experimental approaches that will test methodologies to advance the science of translational science. In particular, we can offer our world-class capabilities to support the use of nonhuman primate models for research of high translational value to public health. With CTSA support, we can use this comprehensive infrastructure to fund new pilot projects and new multidisciplinary research teams, and offer innovative training to help those ventures succeed. Wake Forest Baptist Health is a fully integrated medical center in which governance, quality improvement, and research discoveries ? including the intellectual property that may result from those discoveries ? are highly aligned. In summary, the TSI is poised to be a productive hub within the CTSA network. Project Summary/Abstract Page 203 Contact PD/PI: Li, King C."
"9468344","?    DESCRIPTION: Chronic wounds are an enormously costly worldwide health concern that causes nearly 80,000 lower leg amputations annually in the U.S. alone and is associated with an increased likelihood of death. Strategies to encourage improved repair would impact both quality of life and mortality rates, yet myriad cellular and pathophysiological abnormalities continue to produce severely limited healing incidences with standard therapies. Promising therapeutic alternatives include the application of cellular scaffolds, topical growth factors (GF), or combination wound dressings. However, the incidence of complete closure remains strikingly low and GF delivery strategies largely fail to provide a sufficient quantity of GF to stimulate robust cellular responses. Additional concerns include the need for high GF doses as well as construct escape/off- target effects. New strategies to stimulate efficient and localized production of GFs in situ, by cells involved in active tissue repair, would offer a provocative approach to overcome these difficulties.  Thus, we detail an innovative strategy to improve control over the dynamics and location of GF delivery by harnessing ECM remodeling to stimulate GF gene release and expression. In particular, we will exploit our expertise in designing collagen-mimetic peptide (CMP) nanostructures to engineer DNA polyplex-modified collagen scaffolds that induce localized, high efficiency GF expression coordinated with tissue repair kinetics. Our prior studies show that CMP linkage retains polyplexes for over a month in collagen and preserves gene activity in serum. In vivo model gene transfer was significantly enhanced by the CMP modification, and the duration of expression could be easily tuned for periods of a few days to multiple weeks. Moreover, CMP/polyplex/collagens only released polyplexes during collagen turnover, and the freed polyplexes were linked to collagen fragments that appeared to hijack natural endocytic collagen processing pathways. The ability to maintain stable gene depots should provide key reductions in dosing and limit construct escape in slow-healing chronic wounds. Meanwhile, on-demand release and expression is ideally suited to the uncoordinated repair processes that are a hallmark of the chronic wound environment.  We will produce CMP/polyplex-modified collagens and will determine whether CMP linkage enhances retention within wound sites and stimulates the simultaneous processing of polyplexes with bioactive ECM fragments. We will elucidate key design parameters controlling polyplex retention, CMP/polyplex/collagen processing, and gene transfer, and will clearly link enhanced gene transfer efficacy to improved activity of GFs such as PDGF. Finally, we will use murine and rabbit wound repair models to test the ability of the PDGF gene product to enhance granulation tissue formation and increase the speed and efficacy of wound repair. These approaches will ultimately be useful as a versatile biomaterials platform able to stimulate improved healing in chronic wounds and a variety of other regenerative medicine applications."
"9543138","Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the ?2 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE2) protects against Alzheimer's disease (AD), promotes healthy brain aging, and increases longevity, thereby informing the development of therapeutic strategies for AD and other aging-related conditions. Despite intensive effort to understand why APOE4 is a strong risk factor for AD, the reduced risk associated with APOE2 has garnered much less attention. While APOE2 has been shown to protect against amyloid-? (A?) accumulation, a hallmark of AD pathology, emerging evidence, including our recently published work and preliminary data, demonstrates that APOE2 protects against cognitive decline and increases longevity in the absence of AD pathology. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand how A?-dependent and independent pathways collectively support the function of apoE2 protein in protecting against AD and promoting healthy aging. Given apoE2 in the brain forms larger apolipoprotein particles compared to apoE3 and apoE4 suggesting an overall superior function in transporting lipids, we hypothesize that APOE2 protects against aging-related cognitive decline and AD through hyperlipidation leading to more efficient lipid transport, improved synaptic functions, reduced A? aggregation, and longer lifespan. We will test our hypothesis by employing multidisciplinary approaches including animal and cellular models to address the mechanisms and human studies on a healthy aging cohort to address the relevance. In Aim 1, we plan to analyze how astrocytic apoE2 protects against cognitive decline, synaptic functions and amyloid pathology in an age-dependent manner in our novel cell type-specific and inducible mouse models. We will also breed our experimental animals to the Abca1-KO background thus directly assess how alteration of apoE lipidation impacts the protective effects of apoE2. In Aim 2, we plan to dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of apoE2 using astrocytes and neurons derived from human induced- pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). ApoE isoform-specific effects will be addressed both in patient background and under isogenic conditions. Multiple experimental systems including neuron-astrocyte co-cultures and 3-D cultures will be employed for these studies. In Aim 3, we plan to determine the impact of APOE2 on clinical outcomes, biomarker status, and pathological/biochemical measures in humans using a longitudinal Mayo Clinic Study of Aging cohort. Specifically, we will measure and correlate apoE and apoE-associated lipids in cerebrospinal fluid and blood and with clinical, imaging/fluid biomarkers, and neuropathological markers. Together, our proposed studies will uncover molecular and cellular pathways associated with APOE2-mediated protection against cognitive decline and increased longevity, thereby elucidating the mechanisms and informing therapeutic strategies against AD and other aging-related conditions."
"9453630","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drs. Brooks and Van Remmen have a strong record of collaboration in studies on the role of oxidative stress in sarcopenia. Our previous work demonstrated that young adult mice lacking the superoxide anion scavenger CuZnSOD (Sod1KO mice) exhibit age-related muscle atrophy/weakness that closely mimics the sarcopenia phenotype of old wild type (WT) mice, including degeneration of neuromuscular junctions (NMJ), retraction of motor neurons, elevated generation of muscle mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), and altered calcium homeostasis. Replacing CuZnSOD specifically in neurons of Sod1KO mice reverses muscle atrophy and weakness, NMJ disruption and muscle oxidative stress, implicating motor neuron deficits as the initiating event in sarcopenia in Sod1KO mice. However, neuronal specific Sod1 knockout (nSod1KO) in mice does not result in atrophy of the gastrocnemius muscle, and although muscle specific Sod1 knockout mice show a loss in contractile force, they show no muscle atrophy. Thus, deletion of Sod1 and induction of oxidative stress in either neurons or muscle alone does not replicate the sarcopenia phenotype of the Sod1KO mice, suggesting that sarcopenia results from an interactive effect requiring both tissues. The goal of this study is to define this interaction. We hypothesize that pre-synaptic oxidative stress and damage initiates alterations in NMJ structure and function that trigger postsynaptic increases in mtROS generation, calcium dysregulation, and oxidative stress/damage in the muscle that further disrupt neuronal and NMJ function to generate the sarcopenia phenotype. We will address this hypothesis in three Specific Aims. First, we will examine the effect of Sod1 deficiencies in both neurons and muscle fibers with the expectation that these double knockout mice will recapitulate the phenotype of Sod1KO mice. We will also determine the effect of muscle or neuronal specific deficiency of Sod1 using conditional deletion of Sod1 during adulthood to determine the impact on sarcopenia, independent of possible developmental compensatory changes. Next, using additional conditional knockout models, we will test whether elevated muscle mtROS without presynaptic oxidative stress is sufficient to induce sarcopenia, and conversely, we will determine whether scavenging post- synaptic mtROS in Sod1KO will delay and/or reduce muscle atrophy and functional declines, despite neuronal changes present in the Sod1KO mice. In each model, we will measure oxidative damage and redox status in sciatic nerve, spinal cord, and muscle, NMJ morphology and function, motor unit properties, and skeletal muscle structure, mitochondrial function, calcium handling, and contractility. These studies will definitively show whether neuronal initiation of NMJ disruption is sufficient for muscle atrophy/weakness or if additional alterations in muscle oxidative stress are required to induce the phenotype. Identifying coordinated roles of neurons and muscle in the initiation and progression of sarcopenia will provide new insights into the pathways that are involved in the onset and propagation of sarcopenia."

"9478330","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, or IPF, is a terminal disease affecting as many as 500,000 Americans with no FDA-approved therapies capable of stopping disease progression. The disease is characterized by excessive assembly of extracellular matrix (ECM) by activated fibroblasts termed `myofibroblasts'. Recently, studies have demonstrated that tissue mechanics, specifically tissue stiffness resulting from myofibroblasts assembly of ECM and contraction, is capable of driving the differentiation of myofibroblasts and thus disease progression. In short, myofibroblasts are capable of recruiting more myofibroblasts leading to a disease that progresses unchecked. Despite these recent findings we still do not understand how the process is initiated, nor do we have any therapies that effective halt disease progression. In the current research proposal we hypothesize that an emergent fibroblast subpopulation displays dysregulated mechanotransductive phenotypes due to an inability of these cells to sense the stiffness of their environment. These fibroblasts are thus capable of assembling and contracting the ECM, like myofibroblasts, even in soft environments, thus skewing the matrix from normal to pro-fibrotic. We propose to define the aberrant phenotypes, identify the molecular mechanism, and propose a novel approach toward the normalization of aberrant fibroblast mechanotransduction. We will use a host of cell sources from human to mouse, model ECMs from purely synthetic to human disease-derived, and animal models of disease along with advanced biophysical and cell biological assays to complete the project. The research proposed in this application is significant not only in terms of its potential impact on the clinical diagnosis and treatment of IPF, but also in its impact on our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of the transition from normal wound healing to fibrotic progression within the lung."
"9566854","PROJECT SUMMARY  The main purpose of this proposed U19 program project (PPG) is to comprehensively identify male osteoporosis risk genes and their functions. This PPG application will conduct multi-/inter-disciplinary convergence/integration analyses to study and integrate the crosstalk/interaction among multi-level omics obtained from the three individual component projects. The program project involves extensive data management and  complex analyses. Such analyses require organic and simultaneous consideration of data from multiple component projects, and demand powerful and innovative integrative analysis methodology. Thus, it is necessary to set up/maintain a Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (BBC), focusing on the repurpose of existing, and development and application of novel, integrative analysis approaches.  The main Objective of the BBC is to serve as a backbone support resource for experimental design refinement, data quality control, management, integration, analyses and interpretation, and serve as a synergizer to foster data and information exchange and collaboration for individual projects/cores in the PPG.  Built upon the Core members? close and long-time collaboration and extensive experience in multi-omics data analyses, this BBC will provide indispensable services through the following Specific Aims:  1) To deliver efficient support and services for data management, including high quality data entry and management database implementation and maintenance, data quality control, safety, monitoring, sharing, etc.  2) To provide strong support for and to conduct extensive biostatistics, bioinformatics, and integrative analyses. Closely working with the PPG project investigators, the BBC will support both single-level omics data analyses and perform integrative analyses of multi-level omics data. Particularly, the BBC will pioneer a sophisticated integrative analysis strategy. This highly innovative strategy will link DNA/miRNA/methylation data through anchoring on gene- based mRNA hubs for constructing unified function multi-omics modules, which will then be used in functional gene unit and disease association analyses.  3) To evaluate, validate, and apply novel, robust and powerful integrative analysis methods for identifying/characterizing (epi-)genes and variants for complex diseases. The novel methods will be developed (mainly in a recently funded R01) under rigorous statistical frameworks, and characterize and incorporate among- omics crosstalk/interactions, along with prior biological information, for studying the causal relationship between multi-omics data and diseases. The innovative methods will be applied to and empirically tested on the multi-omics data obtained from this PPG.  The services provided by the Core will be used by all other PPG projects and cores. Overall, the BBC will be efficient, capable and powerful to serve all the PPG projects, and in particular the overall goal of this PPG that intends to integrate the individual project results."

"9521829","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A reduction in plantarflexor power during the push-off phase of walking leads to the slowing of preferred walking speed with age, which in turn negatively affects old adults' health and independence. Although commonly implicated, sarcopenia and muscle weakness alone cannot fully explain the reduction in plantarflexor power or accompanying changes in coordination. We postulate that this disconnect arises from age-related changes in Achilles tendon behavior that alter muscle-tendon dynamics during movement. This study tightly integrates novel in vivo imaging, computational modeling, and motion analysis to investigate tendon deformations associated with physiological loading and movement to an unprecedented level of detail. Our overarching hypothesis is that age-related changes in tendon elasticity and inter-fascicle adhesions have a substantial effect on the ability for muscles to generate sufficient plantarflexor power during movement. This study has three aims. The first aim is to determine how advancing age affects the in vivo behavior of the plantarflexor muscles and Achilles tendon during prescribed ankle flexion movements under physiological loading. We will combine high-resolution static MRI, dynamic MRI, and shear wave elastography to test the hypothesis that advancing age brings altered spatial patterns of Achilles tendon tissue elasticity that predict measured muscle tissue deformation patterns. The second aim is to predict the functional implications of age- related changes in Achilles tendon tissue mechanics on plantarflexor performance during movement. We will link measurements of human movement with a unique computational framework that includes detailed structural representations of the 3D morphology of the plantarflexor muscle-tendons and their dynamic interactions. We will test the primary hypothesis that simulating age-related changes in Achilles tendon elasticity and inter-fascicle adhesions will diminish power production and increase localized tissue strains. The third aim is to investigate age-related changes in Achilles tendon behavior during walking and its relevance to functional motor performance and response to gait interventions. We will measure in vivo Achilles tendon deformations, plantarflexor fascicle behavior, and plantarflexor power during walking. We will couple these measurements with biofeedback designed to elicit prescribed increases in plantarflexor power output. We will use these data to test the hypotheses that: 1) more uniform tendon deformations during walking with aging, which would reflect a reduction in sliding between tendon fascicles, will predict reduced ankle joint kinetics and altered plantarflexor muscle fascicle kinematics, and 2) with aging, different coordination strategies will be used to increase plantarflexor power, adaptations that will be consistent with Aim 2 model predictions. Combined, these aims will reveal the influence of age-related changes in Achilles tendon mechanics on plantarflexor muscle behavior during movement, insights critical for developing informed interventions to maintain or restore mobility while mitigating risk for muscle-tendon tissue damage."
"9544369","Purpose: Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and in 2006 the cost of treating hyponatremia in the US was estimated to be $1.6-$3.6 billion per year. Inappropriate vasopressin secretion is the major cause of dilutional hyponatremia associated with liver and heart failure. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB are expressed by magnocellular neurosectory cells that secrete vasopressin into circulation. Our studies will be among the first to test the role of the BDNF-TrkB signaling in an animal model of inappropriate vasopressin release. We propose that in an animal model of liver failure activity pendent stimulation of the BDNF-TrkB system increases vasopressin release by changing chloride transport preventing or reversing Cl- inhibition. Our hypotheses will be tested with the following Specific Aims:  1. To determine if norepinephrine inputs support chronic activation of AVP neurons in the  SON of male bile duct ligated rats.  2. To determine if BDNF links the increased activation of AVP neurons to the changes in  chloride transport loss of inhibition.  3. To test the role of estrogen in preventing AVP release in female BDL rats. Methods: The studies will employ Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation in combination with immunohistochemistry and laser capture microdissection RT-PCR, metabolism cage studies to measure urine and sodium excretion, DREADD, shRNA site-specific knockdown, and in vitro electrophysiology to test these hypotheses. Benefit: These experiments will address an existing gap in our understanding of neurophypophyseal function and the pathogenesis of hyponatremia. The findings of these experiments could potentially alter the way that inappropriate vasopressin release is studied and conceptualized clinically."
"9428994","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Lung cancer, the most significant cause of cancer deaths in the US, is an urgent public health threat. It disproportionately affects populations that are already plagued by high poverty rates and low education levels. These populations experience both health disparities in the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer and are historically difficult to reach with cancer screening initiatives. While the results from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) indicated that low dose CT (LDCT) is an efficacious and cost-effective strategy for lung cancer screening (LCS), many uncertainties exist with respect to how patient, provider, health system, and societal factors may impact the quality, compliance, effectiveness, and the risk of harms associated with lung cancer screening, within community-based health systems who serve diverse populations. Spanning from Pennsylvania to Hawaii and including five heterogeneous health systems with diverse populations, our proposed PROSPR Research Center, the Center for Research to Optimize Precision Lung Cancer Screening (CPLS), brings together a team of experienced, interdisciplinary researchers and clinicians with long-standing collaborative ties that is well-positioned to pursue research related to the barriers and opportunities associated with the implementation of LCS programs within community settings. The health systems within CPLS include: Henry Ford Health System in Metro Detroit, Kaiser Permanente Colorado, Kaiser Permanente Hawaii, Marshfield Clinic Health System in rural Wisconsin, and University of Pennsylvania Health System. The ultimate goal of CPLS is to identify critical gaps in the LCS process and to design innovative multilevel interventions to reduce lung cancer mortality, particularly among underserved populations. To achieve this goal, CPLS will complete the following specific aims: 1) build a comprehensive data ecosystem by pooling and linking common data elements to capture the entire LCS process and to assess the patient, provider, facility, health system, and societal factors that affect LCS; 2) leverage the CPLS data resource to conduct four high- impact, observational studies of the multilevel factors associated with the LCS process; 3) based on findings from Aims 1 and 2, develop and test interventions to address identifiable gaps in care that may lead to health disparities in LCS, 4) actively participate in Trans-PROSPR research initiatives and collaborate with external investigators via the use of publicly-available CPLS datasets. Our center focuses on the inclusion of diverse, underserved populations that are defined by multiple factors that may adversely impact access to, and utilization of, cancer screening. In response to both the Surgeon General?s strong emphasis on the need to reduce lung cancer mortality and the Cancer Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel?s focus on reducing the disproportionately high cancer death rates in underserved populations, CPLS will serve as a model for high- impact, translational research to reduce disparities in cancer mortality."

"9465425","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Merosin Deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A) is a devastating neuromuscular disease caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene and loss of laminin-?2 protein. MDC1A patients exhibit severe muscle weakness from birth, are confined to a wheelchair, require ventilator assistance to breathe and have reduced life expectancy. There is currently no effective treatment or cure for MDC1A and all affected children will die from this genetic disease unless treatments are soon discovered. Laminin-?2 is required for the formation of heterotrimeric laminin-211 (?2, ß1, ?1 ) and laminin-221 (?2, ß1, ?1) which are major constituents of skeletal and cardiac muscle basal lamina. Laminin-111 (?2, ß1, ?1 ) is the predominant laminin isoform in embryonic skeletal muscle and supports normal skeletal muscle development in laminin-?2 deficient muscle but is absent from adult skeletal muscle. We have recently shown that mouse laminin-111 protein can be systemically delivered to the muscle of laminin-?2 deficient mice to prevent muscle pathology, maintain muscle strength and dramatically increase life expectancy. These findings demonstrate that laminin- 111 is a highly potent therapeutic in the dyW-/- mouse model of MDC1A. At the time of diagnosis, children with MDC1A have developed significant muscle disease and it is unclear if laminin-111 protein therapy is effective at preventing disease progression after it has already started. This proposal will investigate if laminin-111 protein therapy can prevent disease progression after onset, determine if recombinant human laminin-111 can prevent muscle disease and investigate the mechanism of protection conferred by laminin-111 protein treatment. We will test the hypothesis that laminin-111 protein can functionally substitute for laminin- 211 and serve as an effective therapeutic for MDC1A. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims. First we will determine if laminin-111 prevents further muscle damage after disease onset, preserves muscle function and improves survival in the dyW-/- mouse model of MDC1A. Second we will determine if transgenic expression of human laminin-111, recombinant human laminin-111 or recombinant human laminin-211 improves preclinical outcomes in the dyW-/- mouse model of MDC1A. Finally we will determine scalability of laminin-111 protein therapy and define the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles in mouse and dog models. Results from this study will pave the way towards developing laminin-111 protein therapy as a novel therapeutic for MDC1A."
"9659518","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nanoscale drug delivery devices are a promising technology for improving drug efficacy and reducing side effects. Vesicles, which have an aqueous core bounded by a membrane, are especially useful drug delivery constructs because they can encapsulate a large aqueous-soluble payload in the vesicle core and hydrophobic payload in the membrane. The drug delivery vesicles currently in clinical use are constructed from phospholipids and synthetic polymers. However, lipids and synthetic polymers are difficult to functionalize to enable targeting and triggered release at sites of disease. The purpose of the proposed research is to engineer drug-delivery vesicles from recombinant proteins, as protein sequence can be exquisitely controlled and functional domains readily incorporated using standard molecular biology techniques. This proposal consists of three aims. The purpose of Aim 1 is to construct recombinant, unstructured, amphiphilic proteins that have distinct hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains. This will be accomplished by attaching a naturally occurring hydrophobic protein domain to an intrinsically disordered, hydrophilic protein segment. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that this novel class of amphiphilic proteins can assemble into vesicles useful for drug delivery. Assembly will be driven by the hydrophobic effect, wherein the hydrophobic segments associate to shield themselves from water while the hydrophilic moieties face the aqueous environment. In Aim 3, the protein vesicles will be tailored for a specific biomedical application - triggered release of drugs at sites of inflammation. Inflammation is an important target because excessive inflammatory response is associated with numerous diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. This aim will test the hypothesis that functionalizing the vesicles with a peptide that targets E-selectin, a cell adhesion molecule expressed on endothelial cells during inflammation, will cause the vesicles to adhere to activated endothelial cells in shear flow. Furthermore, specific protease cleavage sites will be incorporated into the vesicles so that proteases present at sites of inflammation will trigger vesicle rupture and drug release. Completion of the proposed work will lay the foundation for a broad new class of nanomaterials with potential for enhanced capability, tunability, and efficacy compared to existing drug delivery technologies."
"9451347","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synucleinopathies are a group of clinically important, progressive neurological illnesses for which there are no approved therapies that can slow, halt or reverse progression. These diseases are defined by the presence of abnormal aggregates of the protein ?-synuclein within neurites and cell bodies, known as Lewy pathology. Lewy inclusions are found in brain regions where cell death occurs, but it is not clear how they relate to disease. Recent preliminary data in mouse models using sophisticated, new in vivo imaging approaches suggests that Lewy pathology forms out of the neuron's endogenous ?-synuclein after seeding with recombinant produced ?-synuclein fibrils. Furthermore, only neurons that develop Lewy inclusions are fated to die in these models. Critical questions remain, however, including whether human Lewy pathology is formed by similar mechanisms and if human neurons also die by similar pathways as those in fibril-seeded mouse models. In order to answer these questions, advanced electron microscopic (EM) approaches will be used. The long-term goal is to determine how Lewy inclusion-bearing cells degenerate in human disease in order to guide the development of therapies to halt this process. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that specific structural and molecular properties of Lewy inclusions drive associated neuronal cell death in fibril- seeded mouse models and humans with Parkinsonism. This will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Determine the Lewy inclusion structural & molecular characteristics that predict cell death. 2) Determine the mode of programmed cell death in Lewy inclusion-bearing neurons. 3) Test whether alteration of Lewy inclusion properties underlies aggressive forms of neurodegeneration. The proposed study will be conducted at Oregon Health & Science University in collaboration with consultants at the Mayo Clinic and the University of Pennsylvania, each with complementary expertise in EM approaches to study brain disease and the neuropathology of Parkinsonism. This K02 - Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with the expertise in advanced EM approaches needed to study this relationship of Lewy pathology to neurodegeneration. It will also involve a variety of structured coursework, workshops and formal advising programs in order to provide an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the knowledge gained has the potential to lead to new therapeutic strategies that target cell death in ways that treat Parkinson's disease, Dementia with Lewy Bodies and related disorders."
"9436721","PROJECT SUMMARY  Exposure to traffic related air pollution (TRAP) is known to trigger childhood asthma symptoms and likely contributes to the disparity in asthma prevalence and morbidity in urban communities. Regular physical activity can improve asthma symptoms. However, increased minute ventilation (ie respiratory rate x tidal volume) during activity may increase deposition of pollutant particles into the airways. Thus, pollution may offset the respiratory benefits of physical activity. One of the challenges of accurately assessing the combined effects of pollution and activity on the airways is that inhaled dose of pollutants could vary by proximity to exposure source and by individual differences in minute ventilation. Therefore, our objective is take an individualized approach to assess change in minute ventilation during childhood activities while also considering variability in home and school exposure to TRAP.  We hypothesize that the positive association between exposure to TRAP and asthma symptoms will be most significant among children that are 1) highly physically active and 2) have larger increases in minute ventilation in response to physical activity. In order to address this hypothesis we will take advantage of 2 existing cohorts of children with differing severity of asthma that are enrolled in the Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC) studies. For our first aim we will examine the interaction between exposure to TRAP (assessed at home and school using geographic information systems (GIS) technology) and physical activity (assessed by validated questionnaire) on asthma symptoms. We will evaluate these associations in: 1) a cross-sectional cohort of 320 moderate-severe asthmatics, ages 6-17 that live in 10 urban US cities and 2) a 3 year longitudinal cohort of 150 mild-moderate asthmatics, ages 12-16 that live in 4 urban US cities. For our second aim we will recruit a sub-sample of 40 children with mild- moderate asthma that live in New York City. We will combine individual cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) with 72-hour accelerometry measurements to determine the magnitude of increase in minute ventilation in response to usual childhood activities. Then we will use these values to determine if larger individual increases in minute ventilation influence the relationship between exposure to TRAP and asthma symptoms. With an enhanced understanding of individual susceptibility to environmentally triggered asthma, we will be better equipped to address and remediate the disproportionate risk of asthma morbidity among urban children."
"9558176","ABSTRACT Young Black women (YBW) between the ages of 18 to 24 have higher rates of HIV than any other age or race and ethnicity group of women in Los Angeles County. Social networks of YBW could be both protective and risky via social influence and sexual-health-related communication. Yet there is a dearth of literature on YBW and their social network members (SNMs), particularly regarding how social networks can be used for HIV prevention and treatment. With the current HIV/AIDS priorities of decreasing incidence of HIV and increasing the use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among high-risk groups, examining YBW and their social networks is essential in understanding how to use these networks to implement preventive interventions such as PrEP among high-risk YBW. The proposed two-year Ruth L. Kirshstein NRSA study seeks to reduce HIV/AIDS incidence among YBW aged 18?24 by investigating condom use, HIV testing, and knowledge and perceptions of PrEP as tools to prevent HIV among YBW. To achieve this goal, the proposed study will examine 200 YBW and their SNMs to explore YBW?s social media usage and its association with sexual risk and protective behaviors (i.e., HIV testing, condom use, and interest in PrEP) among YBW (Aim 1); identify subgroups profiles of YBW based on individual- and social-network-level risk factors and investigate whether HIV testing, condom use, and interest in PrEP are key indicators of those subgroups (Aim 2); and investigate whether social network and SNM characteristics are associated with HIV testing, condom use, and interest in PrEP among YBW (Aim 3). Preliminary results from the proposed PI?s pilot study examining 78 YBW women and their SNMs (n = 1,068) revealed that YBW spoke to approximately 55% of their SNMs about sex, 32% about condoms, and 21% about testing for HIV. Additionally, individual-level descriptive statistics revealed that a majority of these women were sexually active (85%), yet very few of the sexually active women used condoms during their last sexual activity (vaginal or anal sex; 19.7%, n = 13). Furthermore, 76% of the women in the study had not heard of PrEP. After a brief description of PrEP, 47% of the YBW reported being interested in taking PrEP as a tool for HIV prevention. Due to the small sample size of YBW (n = 78), there was not enough power in the pilot study to examine associations at the individual level (i.e., condom use, HIV testing, and interest in PrEP). More importantly, individual-level risk-taking behaviors could not be correlated with network variables. Thus, these pilot study data are not sufficient to address the current aims of the proposed study. This proposed study will address these individual-level limitations by recruiting 200 YBW. Findings from this study will provide insight regarding factors not typically examined, such as YBW?s knowledge and perceptions of PrEP and the association of their social networks, HIV risk behaviors, and social media use with condom use, HIV testing, and interest in PrEP."
"9456519","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stem cells and their environment, the so-called niche, are critical components that sustain not only proper tissue homeostasis, but also diseased states such as cancer. The inability to follow the same cells over time in an intact animal is a bi challenge that has greatly limited our understanding of what goes awry during normal tissue homeostasis and the cellular behaviors exhibited in the initial stages of tumor growth. Specifically, this roadblock has hindered our ability to understand both the role of specific cells and how their location contributes to their growth, whether it be normal or cancerous. For the first time, we are now capable of addressing these questions since my lab has pioneered the use of live imaging in skin stem cell regeneration and established an approach that allows us to follow the same cells over time in an intact, live mouse. By these approaches we have learned that first, the location where stem cells reside influences their ability to contribute to growth. Second, as a consequence of a perturbation, such as loss of a stem cell pool, other cells can acquire a new ability to contribute to growth that they did not possess previously. Third, the induction of oncogenic mutations in clones, such as mutations that stabilize the Wnt effector ?-catenin, will drive aberrant growths ultimately leading to tumor formation through the recruitment of non cell-autonomous wild-type cells. However, it is still unclear 1) what signaling mechanisms regulate the aberrant cellular behaviors that will eventually cause tumor development, 2) whether a cell's position within a tissue influences different tumoral outcomes, and 3) what early cell behaviors are adopted by stem and other cell types that lead to tumor development. To identify the aberrant stem cell/progenitor activities that cause cancer, we are using two contrasting human skin tumors; a benign and a malignant form, which we can faithfully recapitulate in a mouse model. We plan to 1) utilize cutting-edge exome and RNA sequencing approaches to identify target gene mutations associated with tumoral epithelial and stromal cell populations and 2) to assess the role of these genes towards cancer by in vivo overexpression and shRNA knockdown in the mouse via in utero injection and subsequent functional validation using our in vivo imaging approach. Together, these approaches will allow us to understand how novel and established target genes alter stem cell behaviors and identify the initial sequential steps that lead to malignant tumor growth. Understanding the mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying the role of stem cells in cancer holds great promise to transform current therapeutic strategies. Our plan aims to identify the relevant cells and genes that are responsible for skin tumor initiation, which may prove relevant for an extended application to other types of cancer."

"9558406","Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal form of adult brain cancers with a median survival of <15 months despite aggressive standard chemoradiation. GBM are formed by GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) - a major contributor to tumor recurrence and a natural focus for therapeutic development. There are two main reasons responsible for treatment failure: 1) high intra- and inter-tumor cellular and molecular heterogeneity with multiple subclones possessing distinct genetic determinants; 2) GSCs exhibit multiple redundant signaling pathways requiring simultaneous targeting of overlapping pathways. We have invented and biologically validated a novel tandem computational platform, GeneRep-nSCORE that integrates large-scale gene expression profiles with genomic changes to identify common founding alterations or master regulators of GSCs that span a large number, if not all, GSC subclones within and across GBM tumors. We discovered such a core set of four common master regulators in GCSs that are outstanding targets for clinical development. Expression of these four factors was sufficient to reprogram normal astrocytes to GSCs, whereas their depletion profoundly abrogated GSCs, and thus tumor development in vivo, in all eight lines of patient-derived GSCs of varied genetic and molecular backgrounds examined to date. The goal of this application is to develop a customized set of Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based genetic tools to target the whole spectrum of GSCs (Phase I) for the purpose of delivering targeting constructs to deplete the four common master regulators responsible for malignant transformation and proliferation in GSCs (Phase II). The specific objectives of this proposal are: (i) using directed evolution and available combinatorial AAV capsid library, and for the first time, introducing a dynamic mode of administration of a library reagent over the time course of tumor progression, to greatly increase the probability of identifying novel AAV variants specifically targeting slow-, and fast-cycling GSCs in patient-derived xenograft models (PDX) (Phase I); (ii) To design and validate a panel of AAV vectors that express shRNAs targeting core master regulators of GSCs to identify leads for preclinical testing; (iii) To optimize modes of viral delivery, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters, and safety and toxicity in normal and PDX treated with lead targeting AAV cassettes; and (iv) Based on these results, tools and basic DMPK data created, to conduct preclinical efficacy studies in PDX treated with lead targeting AAV cassettes either alone or in combination with standard chemoradiotherapy (Phase II) to prepare for an investigative new drug application for clinical testing in patients with GBM, and for commercial development of this novel technology."
"9548015","PROJECT SUMMARY  The rationale for this proposal is that synaptic integrity is essential for neuronal function. Disruptions to synaptic integrity are downstream of common TBI pathophysiological events including neuronal cell death, axonal injury, p-tau aggregation, and neuroinflammation. The ability to detect discrete changes in synaptic integrity ? regardless of the upstream mechanism of synapse loss ? will allow clinicians to track the ability of clinical interventions to improve chronic outcome in patients. The objective of this proposal is to use measures of synaptic integrity to predict chronic behavioral outcomes, and to validate Hcorr as a non-invasive marker of synaptic integrity for use in TBI."
"9455758","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Homeless youths, ages 18-23 years, are extremely vulnerable to poor health outcomes related particularly to substance use and sexual behaviors; adverse health outcomes include substance abuse and HIV/AIDs, often in combination. Although these youths' lives are characteristically unpredictable and the future looks bleak to them and to the larger society, they also have inherent strengths such as optimism, hope, self-efficacy, resilience, and gratitude that represent some of their psychological capital. Psychological capital has been shown to be a strong motivator of behavior. To date very few theory-driven strengths-based interventions have been developed and tested in this population in settings where they drop-in to seek health and human services. The specific aims of this application are to (1) determine the effectiveness of a self-reflective preventive intervention to promote responsible substance use and safe sex behaviors (prevent HIV/AIDS) in homeless youths, ages18-23 years; (2) determine whether psychological capital factors mediate the relationship between background risk factors (sexual orientation, duration of homelessness, sex abuse history, history of substance use, past sexual risk behaviors, and service utilization) and improved proximal outcomes (self-efficacy and intentions) and distal outcomes (responsible substance use, safer sex, life satisfaction); (3) determine the effect of pre-testing on interventin proximal outcomes (immediately following intervention) and distal outcomes (at an interval of 3 and 6 months following intervention); and an exploratory aim (4) to explore general and specific differences in proximal and distal outcomes of the intervention between participants in two geographically different sites (Austin, TX and Columbus, OH). We will recruit a total of 600 homeless youths from 2 drop-in centers in 2 geographic areas of the central US: Austin, TX and Columbus, OH. Using a Solomon four-group design with repeated measures, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of a brief possible selves intervention (PSI) consisting of 6 brief individualized sessions that focus on generating images of one's possible self as feared or as best. Intervention participants will also receive weekly electronic messages to encourage them to move toward a goal of becoming their best possible self. Quantitative data will be collected before, immediately after the intervention, and at intervals of 3 and 6 months following intervention to test hypotheses about the effectiveness of the intervention on health behaviors and life satisfaction as well as the effects of pre-testing on these outcomes using structural equation modeling and ANCOVA statistics. The findings are expected to have a public health impact on further development of individualized services to promote healthy behaviors, healthy lifestyles and life satisfaction for vulnerable youths."
"9644641","Project Summary Rodent-borne viral outbreaks are increasing in both frequency and impact. As weather patterns evolve, rodent populations are affected and may multiply in areas where increased contact with humans results in infection. Hantaviruses, including Andes (ANDV) and Sin Nombre (SNV), are transmitted through the excreta of infected rodents and, when aerosolized, infect humans. In the Americas, hantavirus infection leads to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), a devastating condition that features rapid onset of pulmonary edema, respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock. Treatment is supportive, not pathogen-targeted, and accordingly, approximately 40% of patients do not survive. Because hantaviruses establish lifelong, asymptomatic infections in their rodent reservoirs, they are highly prevalent in nature and represent a constant threat to humans. For example, SNV is carried by the most abundant mammal in North America, the deer mouse, which has a near ubiquitous distribution throughout the US and Canada. In the case of the South American ANDV, in addition to rodent-to-human transmission, human-to-human transmission occurs, putting not only the patient, but also family members and health care workers at risk. Despite this large potential for infection and the high case fatality rate, there are no FDA-approved treatment options or vaccines available. Hantaviruses are thus classified as NIAID Priority Pathogens and considered potential bioterrorism threats. Our long term goal is to develop an effective therapeutic against HCPS-causing hantaviruses. This proposal seeks to develop human neutralizing antibodies for therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of HCPS caused by ANDV. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of molecular virologists, clinicians, B cell immunologists, and industry partners with experience developing antibody-based therapeutics. The successful development of a potent neutralizing antibody against ANDV has the potential to be a first-line antiviral for the treatment or prevention of HCPS."
"9645863","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, 46% are afflicted with a mental illness at some point of life. The management and treatment of mental disorders pose significant economical and social burden to the society. Many rare and common genetic variants, including SNPs and CNVs, are reported to be associated with mental disorders, yet more remain to be discovered. However, despite the large amount of high-throughput genomics data, there is a lack of integrative methods to systematically prioritize variants that confer susceptibility to mental disorders; additionally, despite the presence of many candidate variants for mental disorders, their disease-contributory mechanism remains elusive, so appropriate functional follow-up experiments cannot be designed. Altogether, these problems resulted in a large gap between the copious amount of data about genetic variation and our understanding of their functional impacts on mental diseases, which ultimately delays the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. To address these problems, we propose to develop a suite of novel bioinformatics approaches: (1) NeuroComplex, an information integration approach that leverages phenotype information and multiple sources of prior biological knowledge to rank genes by their likelihood of contributing to specific phenotypic presentations. (2) integrated MEntal-disorder GEnome Score (iMEGES), which leverages a two-layer strategy to predict the impacts of variants in personal genomes on mental disorders. The first layer uses machine learning algorithm to build variant deleteriousness scores for coding, non-coding and structural variants; the second layer integrates variant scores and NeuroComplex to assign pathogenicity scores. (3) a hierarchical model called CombOmics that incorporates cross-omics information to characterizes how variants confers disease risk, in order to help formulate hypothesis of pathogenicity and facilitate the design of functional follow-up experiments. (4) we will develop user-friendly software tools and web applications that implement all the aforementioned bioinformatics approaches, and continuously release and maintain these tools to ensure the maximum benefits to the scientific community."
"9528227","Feeding decisions are tightly regulated based on internal needs. Signals of hunger and thirst are detected by interoceptive neurons that promote specific consumption to restore homeostasis. Although generally considered independently, recent studies have demonstrated that interactions between hunger and thirst drives are important to coordinate competing needs. The aim of this proposal is to examine how food and water consumption is coordinately regulated, using the well developed Drosophila system as a model. These studies will evaluate how multiple internal signals are integrated within a neuron to regulate activity and how the activity of a single set of neurons regulates two opponent behaviors. This research takes advantage of established behavioral assays for water and sucrose consumption in Drosophila, molecular genetics to rapidly manipulate genes and neural function, single-cell electrophysiology for precise measurements of signal integration, and large-scale calcium imaging approaches to study network interactions. Specific Aim 1 will examine how signals of hunger and thirst modulate activity of interoceptive neurons, providing insight into how multiple signals are integrated within a neuron over time. Specific Aim 2 will characterize neurons downstream of the interoceptive neurons to examine how activity is transmitted to circuits to oppositely regulate two behaviors. Specific Aim 3 will determine how interoceptive neurons alter the responses in taste sensorimotor circuits to examine how internal states generate plastic changes in feeding networks. The proposed efforts will determine how internal signals of nutritional state are integrated across time to coordinate feeding decisions. The long-term objective of this work is to provide insight into how neuromodulators regulate circuits and behavior over long timescales, a basic problem in neuroscience relevant across systems."
"9548553","Project Summary (30 lines of text)  One of the underappreciated aspects of neuronal biology is that, as postmitotically-differentiated neurons become mature, they undergo dynamic changes to ensure that the mature nervous system is capable of long- term survival and function. Understanding these mechanisms that are critical for the long-term homeostasis of the adult brain is important as their dysfunction could increase the vulnerability of neurons to age-related neurodegeneration.  We have identified miR-29 as a microRNA that is strikingly induced with neuronal maturation. miR-29 is not detectable during embryonic development, but its levels are induced more than 300 fold by 2 months and even greater by 6 months in the adult brain. In contrast to the high miR-29 levels that are maintained in the normal adult brains, miR-29 levels are markedly reduced in Alzheimer?s Disease patients. miR-29 is recognized to target many of the genes in the AD pathways including BACE1, ADAM10, PICALM, and NAV3.  To evaluate the functional importance of miR-29, we recently generated mice in which miR-29 can be conditionally deleted. Mice deficient for miR-29, either in the whole body or in the brain, are born normal but then progressively decline, exhibiting neurological defects and early lethality. These results show that miR-29 has an essential function in the mature brain. Our hypothesis is that miR-29, while not needed for embryonic development, is physiologically important for maintaining long-term homeostasis in the adult brain. Reduction in miR-29 levels could therefore increase the vulnerability of mature neurons to become dysfunctional in the context of Alzheimer?s Disease.  The overall focus of our proposal is to understand the endogenous mechanisms that maintain the very high levels of miR-29 in the normal brain, to critically examine the function on miR-29 is the adult brain, and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of miR-29 for Alzheimer?s Disease. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis is that an increase in miR-29 transcription in mature neurons is a result of chromatin derepression. Importantly, we will also examine whether the substantial increase in miR-29 is a consequence of increased processing and stability in mature neurons. In Aim 2, we will focus on defining the molecular, cellular and behavioral consequences of deleting miR-29 in the adult brain. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of miR- 29 for Alzheimer?s Disease, we have also generated mice in which miR-29 can be conditionally overexpressed. Thus in Aim 3, we will examine whether overexpression of miR-29 is beneficial in the mutant APP knock-in mouse model of Alzheimer?s Disease.  Overall, we are excited to be working on a molecule, miR-29, that has a unique and essential function in the mature brain. Our studies will help define its mechanisms of action as well as evaluate its therapeutic potential in the context of Alzheimer?s Disease."
"9462824","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this competing renewal, we propose to continue our studies aimed at understanding the role of amyloid ?- peptide (A?) trans-vascular clearance in the development and prevention of cerebral ?-amyloidosis, neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Previous work on this project has identified that A? binds directly to the ectodomain of LRP1 (low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1), and that endocytotic LRP1 receptor is a key receptor for A? clearance at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), by vascular cells and neurons, as shown by us and others. These findings contributed to development of A? clearance approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we focus on PICALM, the gene encoding phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein that plays a key role in controlling endocytosis and the function of cell receptors. PICALM is a significant risk factor for AD, but its role in disease pathogenesis remains elusive. AD-associated SNPs in PICALM (~20) are all located upstream to the coding region of the gene. Our preliminary data show that PICALM could have a central role in A? trans-vascular clearance, development of cerebral ?-amyloidosis, neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Based on our pilot data, we hypothesize that i) PICALM deficiency in endothelium and neurons results in A? accumulation and increased neuronal vulnerability to A? species causing neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration, respectively; ii) PICALM regulates endocytosis of A?-LRP1 complex and A? transcytosis leading to clearance of A? across the BBB; and iii) PICALM allelic variants (rs3851179, rs541458) affect A? BBB clearance and neuronal toxicity by influencing PICALM expression. To test our hypothesis we will cross our novel Picalmlox/lox mouse line with Tie2-Cre mice and Camk2a-Cre mice for endothelium-specific (AIM1) and neuron-specific (AIM2) PICALM deletions, respectively, and will cross these mice with APPsw/0 mice. We will use intrahippocampal microdialysis to study clearance of soluble A?, voltage- sensitive dye imaging to study neuronal function, confocal and light microscopy to study A?, BBB and neuronal pathology, MRI to study microstructural and connectivity changes and BBB permeability changes, and behavioral tests. We will use an in vitro model of human BBB to identify the role of PICALM in A? endocytosis and transcytosis (AIM3); and, CRISPR genome editing to generate human iPSCs with rs3851179 (protective) and rs541458 (pathogenic) allelic variants in PICALM followed by direct lineage conversion to generate human endothelial cells and cortical neurons for studies on PICALM expression, A? BBB clearance and neuronal toxicity (AIM4). To achieve our goals, we propose interdisciplinary studies by a team of Investigators with expertise in A? transport and pathology, BBB, neurodegeneration, behavior, vascular biology, cellular reprogramming and stem cell technology, small rodent neuroimaging and high-resolution connectivity brain mapping. We expect to provide unique novel insights into PICALM biology that will have important implications for our understanding of the disease pathogenesis and may guide the development of new therapies for AD."
"9471761","Abstract Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability and the risk for stroke increases with age. The mechanisms that contribute to post-ischemic injury after stroke are not completely understood, and as a result most clinical trials conducted to date for stroke therapeutics have failed. Failure to consider white matter (WM) injury is a critical gap in the development of successful stroke therapy. As mechanisms of WM injury differ from those in gray matter and change with age, an ideal stroke therapeutic must not only be directed towards neuronal and axonal protection across age, but also must restore function when applied after injury. One of our significant research achievements during the previous funding cycle established that Class I HDAC activation contributes to excitotoxicity during ischemia and contributes to oxidative injury during the post-ischemic period by impairing mitochondrial structure and function. Class I HDAC inhibition promotes axon function recovery when applied before or after ischemia in young and aging WM through unknown mechanisms. Our current proposal focuses on the mechanisms of post-ischemic protection conferred by Class I HDAC inhibition in young and aging WM.  While little is known about the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying this protective phenomenon, an intriguing reciprocal relationship has emerged between levels of HDACs and miRNAs affecting cellular survival following stroke. Among ischemia-regulated miRNAs, miR-331 is predicted to target Class I HDACs. Ischemia up-regulates Class I HDAC levels in young and aging WM. Our preliminary findings show that ischemia led to decreased levels of miR-331 concomitant with increased HDAC expression and HDAC inhibition upregulated miR-331 above control levels. Consequently, an miR-331 mimic suppresses HDAC levels, indicating a reciprocal regulation between Class I HDACs and miR-331. Furthermore, WM ischemia activates nitric oxide synthase (NOS), leading to oxidative injury via mitochondrial dysfunction, and Class I HDAC inhibition attenuates NOS activity. In light of this information, we propose to further extend these studies by testing our novel hypothesis that Class I HDAC activation mediates WM ischemic injury by contributing to increased oxidative stress, impairing mitochondrial function, and down-regulating glial expression of miR-331. Our overall goal is to determine whether Class I HDACs act directly or recruit NOS or interact with miR-331 to exert post-ischemic injury in young and aging WM. Electrophysiological, biochemical, and mouse genetic in vitro and in vivo approaches will be employed to test the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 is designed to investigate whether Class I HDAC activation recruits NOS in an age-, cell-, and isoform-specific manner; Aim 2 is designed to determine whether Class I HDAC activation directly mediates mitochondrial injury during ischemia; and Aim 3 is designed to establish whether Class I HDACs interact with miR-331 to mediate ischemic WM injury. Overall, the present project will unravel the role of Class I HDAC activity in WM ischemic injury in order to help in the design of novel therapies to minimize post-ischemic injury in patients."
"9445375","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Cognitive decline is a problematic and disabling consequence of aging, with memory impairment being one of the most debilitating symptoms. These cognitive changes are paralleled by a dramatic decrease in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep quality, indexed by a reduction in electroencephalographic (EEG) slow wave activity (SWA). Here, we propose that ß-Amyloid accumulation-a leading candidate underlying cognitive decline both in aging and Alzheimer's disease-is one neuropathological factor contributing to disrupted NREM SWA and impaired memory consolidation in older adults. Specifically, we seek to test the hypothesis that ß-Amyloid in a set of midline cortical brain regions disrupts the neural generation of NREM SWA-both cross-sectionally, and longitudinally-thereby impairing hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation in the elderly. As such, these experiments will determine whether or not ß-Amyloid exerts an effect on memory through sleep, and if so, exactly how ß- Amyloid disrupts NREM sleep physiology, resulting in memory impairment in older adults. Translationally, these experiments may reveal new treatment pathways targeting NREM SWA enhancements that improve memory, thereby moderating the cognitive burden associated with ß-Amyloid aggregation."
"9452931","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Provocative question 9 asks: What are the molecular and/or cellular mechanisms that underlie the development of cancer therapy-induced severe adverse sequelae? We respond that untreatable, irreversible neurologic deficits due to cancer chemotherapy constitute a major unmet medical need for cancer patients and cancer survivors. In particular, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), with deficits in tactile sensation and motor function, affect many cancer patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapies. These neurologic deficits often limit the doses of chemotherapy that can be used, and cause a major and often permanent impediment to quality of life in cancer patients and survivors. We do not yet understand the underlying mechanism for chemotherapy-induced axonal degeneration, nor do we have any way of effectively treating the resultant neuropathy. Empirical clinical trials for potential therapies have been disappointing. Therefore, to provide a solid basis to develop therapeutics it is imperative to understand the mechanistic process by which chemotherapies cause CIPN. The proposed studies will define the molecular mechanism of CIPN and initiate novel therapeutic approaches for these dire consequences of treatment. Our study plan focuses primarily on neuropathy caused by the chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. Paclitaxel and related compounds are essential for effective chemotherapies for breast, ovarian and other cancers, and the majority of the more than 100,000 patients treated each year with paclitaxel experience symptoms of neuropathy. In preliminary studies using in vivo models and specialized in vitro compartmented cultures to study paclitaxel-induced degeneration of sensory neurons, we have shown that paclitaxel acts directly on axons to initiate degeneration, and that paclitaxel reduces the intracellular level of Bclw (aka Bcl2l2), a protein essential for the lifelong preservation of sensory axons. Strikingly we find that Bclw differs from its closely related family members, Bcl2 and BclxL, in that only Bclw is altered by doses of chemotherapies that cause axonal degeneration, and only Bclw can prevent axonal degeneration caused by paclitaxel. The proposed studies will elucidate the mechanisms whereby paclitaxel and other chemotherapies affect Bclw expression, and how Bclw prevents chemotherapy induced axonal degeneration. Our preliminary studies suggest the exciting possibility that Bclw-mimetics may provide the basis for designing new therapies that limit or reverse neurologic chemotherapy-induced toxicity, much as leucovorin rescue is used to limit and prevent toxicity from methotrexate or as Neulasta is used to alleviate chemotherapy induced bone marrow toxicity."

An estimated 5 million people age 65 and older in the United States (US) are currently living with AD, and this number may nearly triple by 2050. To address this impeding population burden, the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) 2015 report emphasized the need for identifying preventive strategies that can delay symptomatic disease onset. While much emphasis has been placed on developing and testing effective disease-modifying strategies targeting this asymptomatic preclinical phase of AD (pAD), little emphasis has been placed on currently available strategies that target cognitive reserve, resulting in (1) delaying symptom onset, (2) shortening the overall course of symptomatic disease, and (3) substantially reducing the financial and societal impact of AD. We hypothesize that targeted reductions in inappropriate medication use (Beers Criteria 2015), will bolster cognitive reserve in subjects at risk for AD, delaying the onset of clinical symptoms, and reducing the prevalence and duration of symptomatic disease. The impact of this strategy, if successful, includes a dramatic reduction in overall health care expenditures for the millions affected by AD by delaying the symptomatic phase of disease in accord with NAPA aims. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim 1. Conduct a 12-month, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the impact of our patient- centered, pharmacist-physician team MTM intervention in reducing unnecessary and inappropriate medication use in community-dwelling, elderly, non-demented subjects. Primary outcome measures will include pre- to post- intervention measures of: (1) use of inappropriate medications as measured by the Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI); 2) Cognitive Reserve Change Score (CRCS) defined as the difference in the scopolamine- challenged vs unchallenged measures on the neurocognitive score. Specific Aim 2 Evaluate the impact of preclinical amyloid burden on cognitive reserve deficits and decline (measured as CRCS) to evaluate efficacy of delaying symptomatic disease progression in pAD. While not eliminating AD or shortening duration of biological disease, the delay in symptom onset and progression to functional decline resulting from reduction in inappropriate medication use could lessen AD prevalence and significantly reduce healthcare expenditures related to not only AD, but potentially all forms of dementia involving a prodromal asymptomatic period. Study results would enable the larger implementation of similar medication management strategies in clinical practice to address the need for multifaceted preventive strategies to maintain cognitive health in the aging population."
"9458735","PROJECT SUMMARY Failure to increase insulin secretion and reduce insulin clearance to overcome tissue insulin resistance leads to the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Components of the insulin axis (insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, insulin clearance) are critical to the genesis of T2D, yet the factors that account for their dysfunction and their interactions with other factors are not understood. The nutritional components of diet pass through the intestinal barrier in a complex interaction with the gut microbiota (the microbiome) to impact glucose homeostasis. Our hypothesis is that change in three insulin axis traits is associated with gut microbial composition and function, and this association is modified by dietary components (e.g., whole grains, red meat) including systemic short chain fatty acids produced by the gut microbiota. This study will assess the insulin axis, the gut microbiota and diet in a cohort of 500 non-diabetic adults (half African American, half non- Hispanic White) over 2.5 years (sampled at three time points). Specific Aim 1 will administer, at each clinic visit, a 75-g oral glucose challenge with 0, 30, 60, 120 min measurements (of insulin, glucose, and C-peptide) to determine insulin sensitivity, secretion, and clearance; habitual diet will be determined by use of a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the gut microbiome for each participant by performing 16S rDNA sequencing and low-pass metagenomic sequencing on stool samples collected at all three visits. Together, these data will test the hypothesis that increased insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and decreased insulin clearance (all diabetogenic changes) developing over time are associated with a reduced (at baseline) or declining (over time) abundance of short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria in the gut, in part attributable to unhealthy dietary patterns. Specific Aim 3 will utilize samples collected at the three time points to probe the functional profile of the gut microbiome by conducting deep metagenomic sequencing and assessment of circulating short chain fatty acid levels in a subset of 180 individuals with extreme changes (increase and decrease) versus those with no change in insulin axis traits, thereby identifying microbial functions that underlie change versus stability in insulin axis traits. This study has high impact, yielding knowledge that can lead to novel microbiome-based diagnostics, prevention, and/or treatment measures (e.g., specific diets; antibiotic or probiotic treatment) to reduce the public health burden of T2D."
"9540545","Abstract Hospitalizations for disease, injury, and/or surgery in older adults are likely to impair physical mobility and, therefore, the older adults' capacity to be physically active both during hospitalization and beyond. The resulting sedentary lifestyle is likely to be accepted as the ?new normal?, ultimately increasing the risk of skeletal muscle and metabolic dysfunction (e.g. insulin resistance and sarcopenia). Muscle atrophy and insulin resistance are an unfortunate consequence with disuse in older adults. We have observed with our bed rest studies in healthy older adults that in addition to muscle and metabolic changes, we notice increased skeletal muscle inflammation, impaired glucose uptake signaling and an upregulation of enzymes related to de novo ceramide biosynthesis. The accumulation of ceramide, a toxic lipid intermediate, can disrupt glucose homeostasis and impair muscle growth. Metformin treatment has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and attenuate muscle loss in insulin resistant adults through a mechanism that may involve ceramide synthesis. Metformin used as a preventive strategy to maintain muscle and metabolic health during a period of physical inactivity in older adults has not been investigated. Therefore, I have proposed to conduct a clinical study in older adults to test whether metformin treatment during bed rest will attenuate insulin resistance, muscle loss and accumulation of ceramides. These findings will be foundational in the development of novel treatments, such as metformin, to prevent insulin resistance and muscle atrophy in older adults during disuse periods. In addition to gathering key preliminary data to inform future large scale clinical trials elucidating the muscle protective effects of metformin during disuse, this research project will be linked to specific PhD training experiences, such as the acquisition of new clinical and laboratory skill sets (i.e. coordinating a randomized controlled trial, hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps, ceramide analysis methodology) and one-on one interdisciplinary mentoring experiences in aging and skeletal muscle metabolism. Together, this training plan will be a critical stepping stone in the development of my independent research career."
"9461020","Project Summary  Nitric oxide (NO), a ubiquitous signaling molecule, is important for most physiological processes including bone homeostasis. However, extensive in vitro and in vivo studies that have assessed the role of NO in bone biology have often yielded contrasting results. This is at least in part due to the fact that pharmacologic inhibition of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) or genetic models of NOS deficiency are limited by the redundancies of the NOS isoforms and cannot address the cell- autonomous roles of NO. Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), is a urea cycle enzyme is not only required for the de novo synthesis of arginine, the substrate for NOS, but also to maintain the structural integrity of a NO-synthesis complex containing NOS, argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1), the arginine transporter CAT-1, and HSP90. Loss of ASL leads to non-redundant and cell-autonomous loss of NOS-dependent NO production and thus ASL deficiency (ASLD) is a human genetic disorder of NO production.  The overall goals of this proposal are to study the role of NO in bone turnover, density, and architecture in a human model of NO deficiency and to understand the mechanistic basis by which NO affects bone metabolism. By leveraging an ongoing trial in this rare genetic disorder, we will address these specific questions: 1) Do patients with ASLD have abnormalities in bone turnover and bone mass and does NOS-independent NO supplementation affect these endpoints? 2) Do patient- derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) show differentiation defects along the osteoblastic lineage and how does this impact osteoclastic differentiation? 3) Do osteoblasts derived from patient- iPSC exhibit dysregulation of NO production due to dominance of a caveolin-dependent negative regulatory NOS complex?  These studies could have a significant impact on the basic understanding of bone biology and foster translational studies in utilizing NOS-independent NO supplementation as a therapeutic intervention in the more common disorders like osteoporosis."
"9458077","ABSTRACT Nearly 500,000 older adults are admitted to the hospital annually with traumatic injury. For many severely injured patients, injury from a fall or car crash is a terminal event leading to a 20% in-hospital and 40% one- year mortality. Severe traumatic injury can burden older patients with aggressive treatments they do not want because these treatments often have limited ability to prolong survival or return patients to the quality of life they had before their injury. Given the burdens of treatment and poor prognosis, severely injured older adults would benefit from decision support interventions that facilitate early access to palliative care, which can reduce unwanted invasive procedures, address symptoms and clarify goals. This proposal serves the long- term goal of improving communication for older adults who, together with their family, are facing decisions about invasive treatments?so that their treatment choices reflect personal preferences and goals. ?A communication tool to assist severely injured older adults? is a two-year R21 that responds specifically to PA-13-355 for ?development and evaluation of innovative decision aids for seriously ill older patients and/or their proxy decision makers.? Our research team has developed a novel communication tool called ?best case/worst case? that employs narrative and a graphic aid to illustrate options, express uncertainty and describe outcomes within the context of the patient's underlying health. We have demonstrated that surgeons can learn to use the tool and it is acceptable to patients in the acute care setting, we now need to adapt and test this tool for use with a cohort of patients who are most likely to benefit from early access to palliative care. This project has two aims: Aim 1, to adapt the best case/worst case communication tool to the trauma setting; Aim 2, to test the effect of teaching trauma care providers to use the best case/worst case tool on the quality of communication. This award will produce a decision-making intervention for use in the trauma setting, knowledge about the effect of the intervention on communication, and preliminary data for a future large-scale efficacy study. The research is innovative because it tests a novel, theoretically grounded intervention in a setting where patients and families are most likely to benefit. The research is significant because if the intervention is effective, it offers a low-cost strategy to improve communication with families of older patients with traumatic injury. We are well positioned to achieve our objectives within the scope of this award because we are adapting an existing intervention and evaluating an important intermediate outcome ?quality of communication? with high potential to impact downstream health outcomes."
"9455472","DESCRIPTION: This proposal outlines a 5-year career development plan and research strategy that enables me to bolster my background in OB-GYN/family planning with additional skills and proficiency in translational research in reproductive infectious diseases and to conduct a proof of concept study to explore the mechanisms underlying the risk of HIV acquisition associated with hormonal contraception.    Career Development Plan: Having completed a 2-year fellowship in family planning with in-depth training on contraception and a Master of Public Health degree, I possess a basic foundation in clinical research methodology. Expanding on this foundation, the current proposal integrates aspects of basic medical sciences relevant to reproductive health with advanced coursework. Three major areas are emphasized: 1) Multidisciplinary mentorship; 2) Didactic training in virology, immunology, and advanced clinical research methodology; and 3) Hands-on laboratory training in relevant basic science techniques. The team of mentors includes Dr. Igho Ofotokun, an NIH-funded investigator with vast experience in women's health research in HIV infection and Dr. Denise Jamieson, an adjunct professor at Emory and Chief of the Women's Health and Fertility Branch, Division of Reproductive Health at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). My long-term goal is to become an independent clinician scientist in the field of reproductive infectious diseases with a focus on safe family planning in high-risk populations. The supportive environment offered by Emory University, the Center for AIDS Research, and the Atlanta Clinical Translational Science Institute, in addition to the collaborative relationship with CDC will foster my career development.     Research Plan: I propose to develop my translational research experience around a proof of concept prospective cohort design. Focusing on HIV negative women, the 3 proposed aims will evaluate the effect of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), Etonogestrel impant (Eng-Implant) and Levonorgestrel intrauterine device (Lng-IUD) exposure on 1) HIV target immune cells within the female genital mucosa; 2) markers of T-cell activation and trafficking within the female genital mucosa; and 3) secreted cytokines and chemokines within the female genital mucosa. A prospectively recruited cohort of HIV negative women will allow the examination of the overarching hypothesis that alterations in HIV target immune cells and function within the female genital mucosa underlie the relatively higher HIV risk associated with the pharmacologic doses of exogenous sex hormones, Because the anticipated mucosal immune changes with progestin-only contraceptives are to a large extent mediated via estrogen suppression, the impact of Eng-Implant and Lng- IUD (with milder anti-estrogen effect) is expected to be significantly less pronounced compared with that of DMPA. The outcomes of the proposed study could have significant clinical implications for the provision of family planning services fo women worldwide."
"9491634","Developmental Cancer Therapeutics Program ABSTRACT The Developmental Cancer Therapeutics (DCT) Program has evolved considerably since 2012 with an increased focus on both solid tumor oncology and the translational aspects of advancing basic science into early-phase clinical trials in rapid fashion. Under the leadership of David Horne, PhD and Edward Newman, PhD, the central theme and overarching goal of DCT are the in-house development of novel, molecularly targeted therapies and drug delivery systems for intractable cancers. Although DCT has continued the Program's long- standing strength in evaluating cancer therapeutics developed through industry partnerships, the emphasis of the DCT Program is to advance important basic discoveries made at the City of Hope Cancer Comprehensive Center (COHCCC). To this end, DCT has established clear scientific goals that fall under three central themes: 1) Support target-directed drug development by identifying and validating new molecular cancer targets/pathways and developing corresponding pharmacological agents; 2) Develop novel drug delivery platforms to improve specificity and efficacy of clinical outcomes; and 3) Translate basic discovery and preclinical studies into early-phase clinical trials. The DCT program extends across eight departments and encompasses a total of 29 Members, of which 12 are basic researchers and 17 are clinicians/clinician scientists. Through the Program, close intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations are fostered among basic scientists and clinical investigators, which in turn has yielded an increase in the number of COH-initiated agents currently under clinical investigation. During the previous grant period, significant infrastructure has been established for the creation of a strong translational research program with greater focus on solid tumor oncology, resulting in a continuous flow of new therapeutic approaches poised for early-phase clinical trials. The emphasis is on speed and precision medicine. With only GLP toxicity studies and some formulation work contracted outside, the DCT Program can rapidly translate discoveries to the clinic. This Program has been further enhanced by the strategic recruitment of key faculty (Chen, Fakih, Fong, Gold, and Salgia), implementation of a drug discovery pipeline, and cGMP manufacturing capability for small molecule drugs, such as COH29, through COH?s in-house Chemical cGMP Synthesis Facility. During the next funding period, we anticipate robust translation of our new therapeutic approaches from the discovery phase to first-in-human clinical trials and continued close collaboration with other regional and national Comprehensive Cancer Centers. Membership: 29 Program Members representing 8 basic and clinical departments Publications: 503 total. 20.1% intra-programmatic; 36.4% inter-programmatic; 41.2% inter-institutional Funding: $4,751,305 peer-reviewed; $1,794,235 of which is NCI funding"
"9450553","PROJECT SUMMARY  Attention has a ubiquitous role in perception and cognition, and attention deficits are common in mental illness and as symptomatic of brain damage. Yet, despite its central importance, researchers lack a straightforward way to measure a person's overall attentional functioning. The goal of this project is to develop an attention profile index that can 1) quantify a person's attentional abilities along several dimensions, 2) predict behavior, 3) facilitate comparison across individual differences and within individuals over time, and 4) be measurable in a standardized and practical way across sites. The attention profile measure proposed here uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to predict individual differences in behavioral performance, based on resting state data, collected while participants are scanned without an explicit task. The hypothesis is that attention can be better predicted in terms of intrinsic whole brain functional connectivity networks (individual connectomes) than by specific task activation of localized brain areas. Aim 1 is to develop a battery of whole brain functional connectivity network models that can predict individual differences for different components of attentional performance. We will start with measures of sustained attention, alerting, orienting, executive control, working memory, and tracking. Aim 2 is to apply this battery of functional connectivity models to resting state data, producing an individual attention profile measure, which predicts that individual's behavioral performance for the different attention components. Because our models successfully apply to novel individuals or independent groups, our approach goes beyond a descriptive analysis towards a predictive measure. Aim 3 is to cross- validate the attention models and to characterize their underlying functional neuroanatomy. For example, our sustained attention models can predict attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder symptoms in an independent sample. We can analyze, compare, and even computationally ?lesion? the network nodes and connections that are vital to performance across models and tasks, versus those that are specific to particular tasks or cognitive operations.  A whole-brain attention profile neuromarker can have transformative utility for both clinical and research applications. An attention profile can help quantify symptoms of attentional deficits in other clinical conditions such as dementia, schizophrenia, and brain trauma. An attention profile would also be useful to measure and compare attentional performance longitudinally across the lifespan. These applications are facilitated by the use of widely collected resting state connectome data."
"9454211","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Work from our lab and others has established that expression of the p16INK4a tumor suppressor mechanism plays a critical role in mammalian aging. The expression of p16INK4a in the setting of certain cellular stresses and tissue pathology clearly plays a beneficial role in limiting important age-associated conditions associated with excess proliferation such as cancer and atherosclerosis. The activation of p16INK4a throughout life, however, is associated with the accumulation of cells that have undergone senescence, a permanent form of growth arrest, which is also associated with the elaboration of pathogenic, pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, the beneficial cancer-preventing expression of p16INK4a compromises some aspects of organismal fitness with aging by limiting the regeneration and repair of certain self-renewing compartments. During the prior ten years of this proposal, our group, with collaborators, has provided significant evidence for this model. In 2004, we showed that p16INK4a is a faithful biomarker of mammalian aging. In 2006, we showed that p16INK4a-deficient animals demonstrate a resistance to some aging phenotypes in pancreatic ß-cells, neural stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells, while transgenic animals expressing excess p16INK4a demonstrate an accelerated functional decline with aging in these compartments. In 2009, we developed an approach to measuring p16INK4a expression with aging in humans, and employed this assay to show the age-promoting effects of tobacco use, physical inactivity, chronic HIV infection, and cytotoxic chemotherapy in people. We also identified a highly common polymorphism in humans that strongly affects p16INK4a expression and is associated with atherosclerotic disease. In 2011, we showed an important effect of p16INK4a expression on the physiology of aging B- vs. T-lymphocytes, and provided an explanation for how p16INK4a expression limits atherosclerotic disease. Finally, in 2013, we reported in Cell that p16INK4a expression with aging does not predict malignancy risk in mice, and showed that locus activation results in vivo from cell-non-autonomous mechanisms. In the renewal of this proposal, we seek to extend these prior observations to further enhance our understanding of how p16INK4a influences mammalian aging. In specific aim I, we employ novel reporter and p16CRE alleles to study whether p16INK4a expressing cells are always senescent in vivo. In specific aim II, we will examine the effects of depleting p16INK4a-expressing cells on tumorigenesis and aging using a genetic or immune approach. In specific aim III, we will examine the effects of alterations in the cellular epigenetic state on expression f p16INK4a and somatic stem cell function with aging. Through these approaches, we will further delineate the contribution of p16INK4a expression and cellular senescence to mammalian aging."
"9541434","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Few U.S. adults and children meet established healthy eating and physical activity recommendations despite strong scientific evidence concluding these behaviors can prevent cardiometabolic conditions. Reducing the burden of cardiometabolic conditions will require innovative prevention efforts outside of the clinical arena. Policy-based public health initiatives are a promising approach, yet the implementation of public health policies into practice lags. Local health departments (LHDs) are uniquely poised to improve community health due to their awareness of local health needs and resources, but for instance only one quarter of LHDs report participating in urban design or land use policy processes. Community health improvement plans (CHIPs) represent a data-driven, collaborative, community engaged method for LHDs to identify evidence-based policies and programs, delineate resource allocations and evaluate impact in a standardized method. This emerging strategic approach is endorsed by multiple national organizations, required for public health accreditation, represents an opportunity to implement effective strategies to promote cardiometabolic health, and catalyzes cross-sector collaboration. However, the proportion and quality of local evidence-based healthy eating and physical activity policies included in CHIPs and subsequent implementation processes is understudied. A better understanding of these aspects can inform future implementation science efforts. The proposed research is aligned with NHLBI's strategic plan (6.CC.10), which identifies the need for novel methodologies for implementation research that explore uptake of research findings into approaches, programs, and policies. The proposed mixed-methods research will evaluate the content and implementation processes of evidence-based healthy eating and physical activity policies included within CHIPs developed by U.S LHDs. The specific aims are to (1a) Determine the proportion of LHD CHIPs with inclusion of specific evidence-based healthy eating and physical activity policies and (1b) Identify characteristics of LHDs associated with inclusion of evidence-based healthy eating and physical activity policies in their CHIPs using data from an ongoing national probability survey of LHD officials, administered by the UMass PRC; (2) Assess the quality of evidence-based healthy eating and physical activity policies included in CHIPs through a systematic content analysis of CHIP documents (n~100) identified by the survey (Aim 1); and (3) Assess the implementation of evidence-based healthy eating and physical activity policies in exemplar CHIPs through a multiple-case study approach of semi-structured interviews with a total of 10 key informants who facilitate the implementation of healthy eating (n=5) and physical activity (n=5) priority areas in CHIPs assessed during Aim 2. A tailored training plan accompanies this proposal and outlines the steps required to advance Ms. Sreedhara's career as an independent implementation scientist in public health policy."
"9482767","Although the imperative to translate basic science discoveries into the clinical arena is widely acknowledged, the clinical research workforce is inadequate. The overall goal of the Mentored Clinical/ Translational Research Training Program is to facilitate the research career development of early-stage clinical/translational investigators. The CTSI is a partnership of several academic institutions and healthcare providers in the Milwaukee area. Together with its academic, laboratory, and patient care resources, this partnership provides an enriched, multidisciplinary environment for recruiting and training clinical investigators. The proposed program builds on our successful experience with the existing and integrated Clinical Research Scholars Program (formerly K30) and the Mentored Clinical Research Training Program. We have recruited highly qualified individuals into both of these programs, representing a spectrum of academic and clinical disciplines. Overall, participants in the programs have been successful in terms of numbers of publications, subsequent research grant funding, and career advancement. Our proposed Mentored Clinical Research Training Program is sufficiently flexible to accommodate trainees with different backgrounds, different levels of experience, and different research career trajectories. The next phase in the proposed evolution of the Program is influenced by recent IOM recommendations to focus on career development and team science. The objectives are as follows: Objective 1. Assist each trainee in creating an individualized, comprehensive, and goal focused research career development plan. Objective 2. Integrate team science into research career development. In addition to providing a mentored clinical/translational research experience, related programmatic activities include the following: a comprehensive mentoring plan; opportunities for relevant coursework that may lead to an academic degree, e.g. MS in Clinical/Translational Science; linking each trainee with a career navigator; developing career goals and core competency requirements; creating a Multidisciplinry Project Development Panel for each trainee to assist in the identification of team members; providing pilot grant support for competitive team-based research; orienting trainees to a variety of career options; identifying and creating appropriate peer support groups Several metrics will be used to evaluate trainees and the training program."
"9441010","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Expanding use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV has dramatically decreased vertical transmission rates to <2%. The overwhelming success of PMTCT has resulted in a diminishing population of children born with perinatally acquired HIV infection on the one hand, and a mounting number of HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children on the other hand. Currently an estimated 20% or more of all infants born in sub-Saharan Africa are born HEU.  In utero HIV/antiretroviral (ARV) and postnatal ARV treatment are known to perturb energy metabolism and could have permanent effects on the future metabolic health of HEU infants, including the development of insulin resistance. Early maladaptive changes in mitochondrial function and intermediary metabolism in HEU children exposed to ARVs may be mediated in the intrauterine environment through changes in fetal metabolic programming, and thus, may impact metabolic outcomes in these children. Through our work, we have demonstrated that exposure to specific in utero and neonatal ARVs may affect insulin sensitivity and fuel substrate utilization more than other ARVs in HEU infants early in life. Long-term and mechanistic evidence is scarce, however, in this population, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This study investigates the impact of in utero and postnatal HIV/ARV exposure on the metabolic health of HEU infants/children. First, we will assess whether in utero and neonatal HIV/ARV exposure is associated with changes in insulin sensitivity in HEU children from birth to 3 years of life using HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) infants as a comparator group. In addition, we will evaluate whether specific neonatal ARV prophylaxis regimens differ in metabolic effects amongst HEU children. Second, we will use targeted metabolomics to evaluate whether specific intermediary metabolites (short chain acylcarnitines and branched-chain amino acids) reflect or contribute to changes in insulin sensitivity in HEU and HUU children. Third, we will explore the role of the mitochondria in insulin sensitivity and intermediary metabolism amongst HEU and HUU children in an effort to understand potential mechanisms and targets for future studies.  Building on our previous work with HEU and HUU infants in Africa, we propose a new prospective cohort study with a nested randomized component in HIV-infected and -uninfected woman/child dyads in Botswana. If in utero and postnatal HIV/ARV exposures are found to contribute to derangements in intermediary metabolism such that insulin sensitivity is altered early in life and HEU children are at increased risk for insulin resistance later in life, this woud impact screening and prevention strategies for diabetes in this vulnerable population and argue for further research to identify pre- and postnatal ARV regimens with superior PMTCT efficacy, but with minimal adverse metabolic consequences to the exposed fetus or infant."
"9554166","ABSTRACT The goal of this Fast-Track STTR project is to develop a Deterministic Lateral Displacement (DLD) microfluidic device that can enrich white blood cells (WBCs) from a typical leukapheresis unit in 1 hr, for use in manufacturing cancer cellular immunotherapy. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy has been recommended for FDA approval to treat relapsed or refractory pediatric and young adult patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. There is a critical need for cost-effective automated methods to improve the efficiency and yield of large-scale enrichment of WBCs for use in manufacturing CAR-T and other cellular therapies. GPB is a pioneer in developing novel DLD microchips to process blood cells for cell analysis (19,26). GPB now proposes to develop, evaluate and commercialize a compact device in which an entire leukapheresis unit (up to 5x1010 WBCs in up to 300 ml) can be processed in a ?Leuko-stack? of disposable single-use multi-channel DLD chips to produce in 1 hr a washed cell suspension that is enriched in WBCs and depleted of red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets (PLT). In Phase I, Aim 1 is to increase cell throughput through the current prototype chips by: 1) optimizing DLD chip design and operation to increase flow rate; 2) increasing throughput by stacking plastic chips and running them in parallel (?Leuko-stacks?); and 3) translating chip production to high-volume manufacturing material such as Cyclic Olefin Polymer (COP). Final Phase I milestones to proceed to Phase II are: 1) final chip design with a flow rate of at least 25 mL/hr via a single chip, at least 70% recovery of viable WBCs and immunophenotype- defined T-lymphocytes, and ability to process cells for 1 hr without clogging; 2) Leuko-stack of at least 6 chips run in parallel, with the same output as in #1; 3) combined increases in throughput via #1 and #2 sufficient to process a 300 ml leukapheresis unit in 1 hr; 4) confirmation that the chips can be produced from COP. In Phase II, Aim 2 is to build final prototype COP plastic chip-based microfluidic device capable of processing a leukapheresis sample at 300 mL/hr. Aim 3 is to test performance of prototypes from Aim 2 with leukapheresis aliquots and then full-size human leukapheresis samples. The final milestone of this project is to produce a set of commercial prototype Leuko-stacks that can process an entire 300-ml leukapheresis unit in 1 hr with at least 70% WBC and T-lymphocyte recovery, at least 90% depletion of RBCs, at least 80% depletion of PLTs, and at least 70% recovery of T-cell expansion capacity (as compared with the input samples) in significantly more than 50% of samples tested at 2 sites. The GPB Leuko-stack platform will preserve the advantages of DLD microfluidic cell processing over current methods, while massively increasing throughput rate and cell processing capacity, thus transitioning from analytic- to preparative-scale WBC enrichment for subsequent manufacture of CAR-T and other cell therapies."
"9439877","Summary: Otitis media (OM) is the most common childhood bacterial infection and the leading cause of conductive hearing loss. It remains a major health problem and a substantial socioeconomic burden. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a major bacterium causing OM. Currently there is no effective vaccine available for NTHi and inappropriate systemic use of antibiotics increased antibiotic resistance. There have been no available non-antibiotic agents effectively permeating across intact tympanic membrane (TM). The major hallmarks of OM are overactive inflammation and mucus overproduction, which play a critical role in conductive hearing loss in children with delayed speech and language development. Thus there is currently an urgent need for developing innovative therapeutic agents to suppress inflammation and mucus overproduction and improve hearing. Moreover, non-invasive ototopical administration of therapeutic agents is highly desirable as it allows achieving much higher local concentration in middle ear and has much less adverse effects compared with systemic administration. Recently, taking advantage of drug repositioning strategy (Innovation), we identified the novel therapeutic effects of two existing drugs Vinpocetine (anti-stroke drug) and Roflumilast (anti-COPD drug) in mouse models of OM. Interestingly, our exciting preliminary studies demonstrate that non-invasive post-infection ototopical administration of Vinpocetine and Roflumilast formulated in hydrogel containing chemical permeation enhancers (CPEs) inhibited NTHi-induced middle ear inflammation, suppressed mucus overproduction, enhanced NTHi-induced up-regulation of bactericidal ?-defensin and improved bacterial clearance, and also improved hearing in well-established mouse OM models (both acute and chronic OM) with intact tympanic membrane which represents most common clinical situations of OM children (Innovation & Significance). Encouragingly, no detectable ototoxicity was observed with any of these treatments. These encouraging preliminary data have demonstrated the significant therapeutic potential of these two highly promising repurposed drugs, and thus laid a solid foundation for us to fully test their efficacy and toxicity in OM. Two Specific Aims will be pursued to determine the therapeutic efficacy of CPE-mediated non-invasive ototopical administration of Vinpocetine (Aim 1) or Roflumilast (Aim 2) in suppressing inflammation and mucus overproduction, improving bacterial clearance and also hearing in acute and chronic mouse models of otitis media. These studies may lead to the development of novel and non-invasive ototopical therapeutic agents for OM (Translational and Therapeutic Significance)."
"9462623","Abstract The potential for hematopoietic stem cell therapy to cure HIV disease gains credence from the experience of the `Berlin patient' and is made more feasible by emerging developments in gene editing, particularly when coupled with non-mutating RNA based transduction strategies: the strength of Project 1. It is also now possible to credibly test anti-HIV cell therapies pre-clinically using humanized mouse models: the strength of Project 3 and Core B. What remains a challenge to reduce the complexity of hematopoietic stem cell transplant so that it may be more readily adopted in settings that are not acutely life threatening such as chronic HIV disease. Gene editing will make possible autologous cell transplant thereby removing the devastating complication of graft versus host disease. However, `conditioning' to enable stem cells to engraft the marrow is toxic and requires resource intensive hospitalization as currently practiced. We propose to use methods of modifying hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells' (HSPC) interactions with their bone marrow microenvironment to test novel, niche sparing methods to enable HSPC engraftment with reduced toxicity and potentially less cost, while assessing the impact on HIV-1 reservoirs and generation of T lymphoid reconstitution. The specific aims of this project are: Specific aim 1. Competitively advantage donor cells over endogenous stem cells through selective inhibition of eicosanoid signaling. Specific aim 2. Enhance niche vacancy without niche toxicity through manipulation of CXCR2 and heparan sulfate proteoglycan interactions between stem cells and the bone marrow niche. Specific aim 3. Selectively deplete endogenous hematopoietic cells using a novel saporin-antibody hybrid based targeting system. Specific aim 4. Test the role of conditioning in reducing the `reservoir' of HIV infected cells by comparative analysis of cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic methods of conditioning in HIV infected xenogeneic models.

"9473802","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among all cardiovascular-related diseases, coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death in western countries. The incidence and progression of heart disease is different in males and females, indicating that some protective factors are enhanced in one sex. The long term objectives of this project are to identify cellular and genetic mechanisms, regulated by sex chromosomes and gonadal hormones that affect cardiovascular disease, to improve the understanding of endogenous mechanisms of disease, and to identify sex-biased protective factors that may become targets for therapies. Previous research from our labs indicated that the number of X chromosomes causes striking differences in the response of XX and XY mice to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, independent of the gonadal sex of the mice. XX mice show dramatically greater susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, relative to XY mice, and lower post-ischemic heart contractile function. The XX vs. XY difference is attributable to the number of X chromosomes, not the presence/absence of the Y chromosome. Kdm6a is an X chromosome gene that escapes inactivation and is expressed higher in XX than XY cells, and two copies of this gene (as occurs in XX cells) cause greater I/R injury than one copy (as occurs in XY cells). The central hypothesis is that Kdm6a contributes to X chromosome dependent me /R injury via epigenetic regulation. Moreover, because estradiol is a female-enhanced factor that protects from I/R injury, one hypothesis is that estradiol regulates gene targets of KDM6A. Aim 1 will test whether KDM6A is responsible for the XX vs. XY difference in I/R injury by measuring infarct size and heart functional recovery in mice with different copy numbers of Kdm6a (deleting one copy of Kdm6a from XX mice, and adding Kdm6a to XO mice). Aim 2 will discover direct targets of histone demethylase KDM6A, and measure the changes in expression of genes regulated by KDM6A dosage. These studies will define a short list of genes downstream of KDM6A that can be tested to determine if they mediate KDM6A's effects on me /R injury. Aim 3 will compare the effects of two female-specific factors, estradiol secreted from the ovary, and the presence of a second X chromosome, to establish how each factor influences the effect of the other. Genes regulated by KDM6A will be tested to determine if they are also regulated by estradiol. These studies are intended to provide a more sophisticated mechanistic understanding of the differences in I/R injury in females and males, with an eye towards discovering novel protective mechanisms that could become targets for therapy in both sexes."
"9457449","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A growing body of research is showing that chronic circadian rhythm disruption, as experienced by rotational shift workers and patients suffering from sleep phase disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric disorders, can lead to behavioral and physiological problems such as insulin insensitivity, depressed or agitated mood, impulse control issues, and cognitive deficits. To regulate circadian rhythms, light information reaches the brain via efferent projections of intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In order to develop effective treatments for circadian rhythm disruption, it is imperative to understand and separate out the specific pathways through which light information reaches the SCN from other mRGC mediated effects, such as the pupillary light reflex which is mediated by mRGC projections to the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN). This proposal aims to identify distinct retinal cell- mRGC-brain region circuits for different non-image forming (NIF) visual responses and molecular players that underlie those circuits. In order to identify mRGCs that specifically project to SCN o to OPN, TVA, an avian receptor not found in mammalian cells, will be expressed in the mRGCs of Opn4Cre (cre-recombinase driven by melanopsin promoter) mice via intravitreal injections of cre-dependent AAV. Stereotaxic injections of TVA dependent red glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus (EnvA-SAD?G-mCherry) into the SCN and blue glycoprotein- deleted rabies virus (EnvA-SAD?G-BFP) into the OPN will allow SAD?G to be taken up in mRGC axon terminals ending at the injection site. Glycoprotein deleted rabies virus is unable to spread transsynaptically but continues to replicate within the infected cells- effectively filling all processes with fluorescen protein and allowing for identification of mRGCs that specifically project to SCN (will express mCherry), those that specifically project to OPN (will express BFP), and subtypes of mRGCs. In a separate experiment, rabies virus glycoprotein (RV-G) will be targeted to mRGCs. Infection of RV-G-expressing mRGCs with SAD?G will allow the fluorescent rabies virus to spread one synapse in the retrograde direction. This will allow SCN or OPN specific mRGCs to label upstream retinal cells with the same colored SAD?G and may reveal exclusive retinal cell-mRGC-brain region di-synaptic circuits. Lastly, next generation sequencing will be applied to mRGC populations that are fluorescently labeled based on their central target projections to generate gene transcription profiles of target- specific mRGC populations. Comparisons between gene expression profiles of different target-defined mRGC populations will reveal genes that are preferentially expressed in mRGC populations that specifically project to SCN or OPN. All together, these experiments will identify brain region-specific mRGC projections and retinal cell inputs, uncover molecular players that underlie target-specific mRGC projections, and inform about potential targets for treating circadian rhythm disruption."
"9518020","ABSTRACT ? ? Medical and surgical care is fraught with hazards, particularly in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Powerful institutional wide processes to improve health safety have come from high reliability organizations (HROs) which have advocated adoption of a ?culture of safety,? which is the shared values, attitudes, perceptions, and patterns of behavior that determine the effort with which staff direct their attention towards minimizing patient harm. Measures of staff perceptions about safety culture?termed the ?safety climate?? are critical to develop quality improvement efforts. Our overall goal?is to improve surgical safety for children by building a safety culture in resource constrained settings. Following measurement of the safety climate at two ? pediatric units in two public hospitals in Guatemala using a low cost, standardized, electronic survey tool, we will assess the implementation of the SCORE safety program at these two units.

"9458220","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Although we used to believe that all retrotransposition occurred in the germ line in humans, over the past 10 years it has become clear that somatic retrotransposition, especially of LINE1s (L1s), is prominent, at least in the brain and in epithelial cancers. A number of groups have shown retrotransposition in neural precursor cells and the adult brain. Likewise, a number of groups including our own have shown significant retrotransposition in gastrointestinal cancers. A key finding of our studies is that most L1 insertions in GI cancers occur very early in cancer development. Indeed, some of the insertions are found in low concentration (detected only by nested PCR) in normal cells, but they become essentially clonal in the cancer (detected by conventional PCR). ln this application, we strive to answer two big questions in the field. First, does significant retrotransposition occur in adult somatic tissues outside of the brain and, if so, at what frequency? In this aim we will study L1 insertions in single normal cells near the tumors to find what fraction of the insertions in the tumor are already present in normal cells. We will determine if retrotransposition rate is greater in normal cells or in tumor cells. We will also stuy the frequency of insertions in single normal cells not associated with cancer and from various organs to determine if some tissue types have a greater propensity for retrotransposition than others. The second big question is: Does L1 somatic retrotransposition have any significant role in the etiology of cancer? We need to determine whether we can alter the cellular phenotype towards normal by deletion of somatic L1 insertions found in cancer-related genes in cancer-derived cell lines."
"9447224","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  All blood cell types that make up the adult cardiovascular system are created and maintained by self-renewing, multipotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Conserved across vertebrates, HSPCs are specified early in development, arising from a unique population of vascular cells called the hemogenic endothelium. Given the difficulties in the ex vivo differentiation and expansion of HSPCs from pluripotent stem cells for regenerative therapies, it is readily apparent that knowledge about HSPC specification is significantly lacking. This gap in understanding stems from the challenges in visualizing HSPC emergence in mammalian embryos that develop internally. The proposed study will address these biological problems with the zebrafish model because the transparency and external fertilization of zebrafish embryos will allow for the molecular dissection of the mechanisms that control this dynamic endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT) in vivo.  Small, non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of stem cell and cardiovascular biology because of their ability to post-transcriptionally silence a diverse array of target genes. While miRNA regulation is crucial for HSPC self-renewal, maintenance, and differentiation into multiple lineages, the role for miRNAs in hemogenic endothelial specification and HSC emergence is largely unexplored. From a reverse genetic screen to identify the cardiovascular function of endothelial-enriched miRNAs in zebrafish, mir-223 was identified as a novel candidate regulator of HSPC specification because the loss of mir-223 led to an expansion of HSPCs at the onset of HSPC induction. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to directly test the hypothesis that mir-223 functions to negatively regulate the transition from endothelial to hematopoietic cell fates. By employing an innovative strategy to create a mir-223 fluorescent reporter, mir-223 localization patterns will be assessed for the first time in vivo and correlated with the dynamic emergence of HSPCs from the hemogenic endothelium in zebrafish. The proposed research will also examine whether mir-223 functions in HSPC production by visualizing changes in hemogenic endothelial specification and cellular behaviors of emerging HSPCs when mir-223 activity is lost or elevated. Finally, the genes that are directly targeted by mir-223 during EHT will be identified by their upregulation in mir-223 mutants compared to wildtype hemogenic endothelial cells. Altogether, this proposed work will implicate miRNA regulation as a fundamental mechanism of HSPC specification, and will better define the genetic network regulating this process. Importantly, these studies will establish the zebrafish mir-223 mutant as a new leukemogenesis animal model, and will have the potential to instruct regenerative medicine approaches in the ex vivo production of HSPCs for the treatment of leukemia and other blood disorders."

"9463347","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to identify the key metabolic pathways utilized by osteoblasts in vivo for optimal bone formation. Recent studies have shown that modulation of metabolic pathways is a key determinant of cell fate and differentiation. For example, during activation immune T-cells engage aerobic glycolysis for cytokine production; vascular endothelial cells also utilize aerobic glycolysis during vessel sprouting. Hematopoietic stem cells, osteoblasts and osteoclasts depend on glutamine metabolism for optimal differentiation. In our preliminary studies we observed that osteoblasts during early stages of differentiation upregulate both oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. Differentiated osteoblasts on the other hand are highly glycolytic even under aerobic conditions, suggesting that they prefer aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). The substrates that are utilized by osteoblasts and the catabolic pathways that are active during osteoblast differentiation in vivo is currently an unknown in skeletal biology. In this proposal we will utilize a novel mouse model where we will overexpress MitoNEET a mitochondrial membrane protein specifically in the osteoblasts. MitoNEET over- expression should result in suppression of ?-Oxidation dependent oxidative phosphorylation and an increase in glycolysis. We will achieve this using two specific aims. 1) In specific aim 1 we will utilize preosteoblast MC3T3E1 cells to identify the mechanisms and metabolic pathways through which MitoNEET regulates osteoblast differentiation. We will generate MC3T3E1 cells infected with rAAVMitoNEET and control rAAVGFP viruses and utilize these cells to study OxPhos, Glyc and glutamynolysis. By manipulating glucose, pyruvate, fatty acids and amino acids as substrates and using specific inhibitors in vitro we can begin to analyze which metabolic pathways are essential for optimal differentiation. We will utilize novel Seahorse extracellular flux technology to study the differen pathways. 2) In specific aim 2 we will study the in vivo effects of MitoNEET over-expression specifically in osteoblasts. We will perform comprehensive skeletal phenotyping of rtTARunx2TREMitoNEET mice using micro-computed tomography (?CT) analysis and bone histomorphometry. This will identify the role of decreased OxPhos in bone acquisition. We will use metabolic cage studies to measure oxygen consumption, and energy expenditure of the mice and correlate these to the skeletal phenotype. We will use osmium tetraoxide staining to characterize marrow adiposity in the rtTARunx2TREMitoNEET mice. These experiments will provide insights into the role of ?-Oxidation dependent oxidative phosphorylation, and will begin to define the context specific nature of osteoblast bioenergetics during critical phases of differentiation."

"9460009","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a growing recognition that mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or concussion is a major health issue, with over 2 million cases each year in the United States. Moreover, there is increasing concern that there may be a period of vulnerability after one mTBI, during which time a second mTBI may induce greatly exaggerated pathophysiological effects. We have used a multidisciplinary approach to generate experimental in vitro and in vivo models that replicate the mechanical loading conditions of mTBI in humans. With these models, we have recently identified that diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a key pathology of single mTBI. In addition, we have shown that microtubule damage as well as dysregulation of sodium channels on axons following traumatic injury are watershed events contributing to axonal vulnerability, dysfunction and degeneration. Moreover, we have generated promising preliminary data indicating the utility of novel neuroimaging and serum biomarkers for the detection of brain damage in mTBI. Here, we propose to use these models to 1) investigate novel diagnostic techniques to evaluate axonal pathology in single and repetitive mTBI, and 2) explore the mechanistic roles of axonal cytoskeletal changes that may induce enhanced vulnerability that accounts for exacerbated damage with a repeat mTBI. Innovation: Success of the proposed studies could lead to 1) new diagnostic criteria to identify mTBI pathologies, 2) identify new pathologies and mechanisms of single and repetitive mTBI, and 3) reveal new therapeutic targets."
"9497115","PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past two decades, there has been substantial growth in opioid consumption during pregnancy, diagnoses of opioid use disorder among pregnant women, and neonatal complications from in utero opioid exposure. Untreated opioid use disorder among pregnant women leads to poor outcomes for the mother and infant; however, opioid agonist treatment (OAT) for opioid use disorder is highly effective. OAT improves treatment retention, reduces relapse risk, reduces HIV-risk, reduces criminal behavior, reduces risk of overdose death, and improves birth weights. Further, ensuring access to OAT before pregnancy decreases the likelihood of illicit drug use during critical times of fetal development in the first trimester. Despite evidence that treatment is effective in mitigating adverse outcomes from opioid use disorder, evidence suggests that the vast majority of patients in need of treatment do not receive it. We will conduct a rigorous and reproducible field experiment of randomly-selected outpatient buprenorphine providers and opioid treatment programs in 10 states with a range of state policies. The study will include simulated female patients of reproductive age with randomly-selected characteristics, including pregnancy status. We aim to determine whether: 1a) pregnant women with opioid use disorder are more likely to experience difficulty accessing OAT when compared with non-pregnant women, 1b) insurance type modifies ability to access OAT, and 2) state policies promote or hinder access to treatment. The proposed study uses a rich array of methodologies and leverages an experienced research team with expertise in qualitative research, health law, addiction medicine, biostatistics, health policy, health services research, and economics. Results from this work will have immediate applicability to state policymakers tasked with using finite resources to combat the opioid epidemic and improve outcomes for this vulnerable population."
"9412374","Project Summary: Ras proteins play a central role in many aspects of biology. These monomeric GTPases cycle between an inactivate GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. Mutational activation of Ras occurs in approximately 30% of human tumors with some cancers such as pancreatic cancer having Ras mutations in >90% of tumors. These cancer associated mutations trap Ras in the GTP-bound state, leading to chronic activation of Ras-regulated signaling pathways and oncogenic transformation. Thus, RasGTP has been considered the only biologically important form of the molecule. However, we have discovered a novel role for nucleotide-free Ras (nfRas) in the negative regulation of cell signaling. This form of Ras, formed as an intermediate in the transition from RasGDP to RasGTP, negatively regulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, class 2beta (PI3KC2?). These finding have profound implications for the understanding of Ras-mediated signaling and transformation. We propose that nfRas binds targets, e.g., PI3KC2?, leading to the mutual inhibition of both Ras and the associated target. Our model predicts that oncogenic activation of Ras leads to loss of repression of these targets resulting in their activation without binding RasGTP. Thus, our findings point to a new class of molecules important for Ras-driven tumorigenesis yet do not bind activated Ras. To better understand the role of nfRas in cell signaling, we have generated high affinity, high specificity monobody reagents that selectively bind different states of Ras. Using these reagents we demonstrate that nfRas represents a significant pool of total cellular Ras. In addition, one of our Ras monobodies which binds to all three forms of Ras (GTP, GDP, and nucleotide free) acts as a highly potent inhibitor of oncogenic Ras- mediated signaling. Using these reagents we will characterize the regulation of nfRas in vivo and determine the role of nfRas in regulating specific targets. Finally, we will utilize these novel monobody reagents to perturb Ras function in vivo using a novel chemical-genetic approach to interfere with pancreatic cancer development and progression. Given the prevalence of Ras mutations in human cancers, it is critical to understand the mechanisms through which Ras contributes to tumorigenesis. Our work represents an entirely new concept in Ras biology that defines a new class of targets that participate in Ras-mediated signaling and transformation. These studies will provide new insights into the mechanisms of Ras-mediated tumorigenesis and are therefore of high translational significance. This work will be beneficial to Veterans as well as the general population, both of which suffer from cancer. However, the incidence for certain cancers, such as lung and pancreatic cancer the latter of which has a high incidence of Ras mutations (<90%), has been reported to be up to 5-7x higher in Veteran populations making these studies particularly relevant to Veterans. Additionally, the goals of our proposal are consistent with the recently established National Cancer Moonshots Program to accelerate research efforts to improve cancer treatment. Finally, given the ubiquity of Ras family members in eukaryotes and their roles in many aspects of biology these results will be of broad scientific interest and importance to many areas of biomedical research."
"9566856","Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disease mainly characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD,--areal BMD (aBMD) unless otherwise specified). Male osteoporosis is a major but most neglected public health problem. Peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) may act as precursors of osteoclasts, the bone resorption cells, and produce cytokines important for osteoclast differentiation, activation, and apoptosis, and thus represent a major systemic cell for bone metabolism. micro-RNA (miRNAs)-mediated gene expression modifications are important transcriptomic dynamics underlying human diseases, and are involved in osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Next-G RNA- seq has an unparalleled power to comprehensively characterize transcriptome, in particular, revealing novel miRNAs. Therefore, our Hypothesis is: Changes in mRNA and miRNA expression profiles in PBMs underlie male BMD and bone quality/strength variation and can be identified most powerfully by the cutting edge Next-G RNA-seq.  Through the Clinical Core, we will recruit and clinically phenotype 200 Caucasian and 100 African American (AA) men, aged 20-30, 150 (100 Caucasians and 50 AA) with high and 150 (100 Caucasians and 50 AA) with low BMD. Bone quality/strength (measured by quantitative CT [QCT] and finite element analyses [FEA]) will also be assessed on each subject. Half of the Caucasians (50 high vs. 50 low BMD subjects) will serve as a ?discovery cohort? and the other half as a ?replication cohort?. These same subjects will all be used in Proj 2 & 3.  In Aim 1, we will comprehensively identify mRNAs important to male osteoporosis. We will use the PBMs total RNAs of the ?discovery cohort? to perform RNA-seq-based transcriptome studies to identify mRNAs differentially expressed (DEx) in high vs. low BMD subjects. We will identify the top 10 DEx genes and validate them in the discovery cohort (within-cohort technical validation), the replication cohort (across-cohort biological validation), the AA cohort (across-ethnicity validation), and another independent set of 86 Caucasian female (46 high vs. 40 low BMD) subjects (from our SCOR, for across-sex validation). In silico replication in subjects of different sexes and/or ethnicities will be performed in existing functional genomics datasets.  In Aim 2, we will identify/validate DEx miRNAs in high vs. low BMD subjects and the target genes of the top DEx miRNAs. We will identify the top 15 DEx miRNAs, and for each of which, identify top 5 potential target mRNAs through correlation and bioinformatics analyses and also validate their ?targeting? relationship in the above mentioned cohorts/datasets as well as using luciferase-based functional assays.  The significant mRNA/miRNA identified above will be tested for their significance for QTC and FEA measures.  The data generated in this project will be used for more advanced analyses, such as eQTL/mQTL analyses, gene network analyses, causality analyses and other integrative analyses , e.g., to 1) gain functional insights into the genetic variants and DNA methylation marks identified in Proj 1 & 3; and 2) search for consistent signals of important risk genes through combined analyses of sub-signals at DNA and mRNA levels by data collected in Proj 1 & 2; 3) identify interactions of various epigenetic mechanisms such as miRNA and DNA methylation."
"9482763","PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to develop statistical methods for the analysis of the local covariance structure between measurements in multimodal biomedical imaging studies. Despite the rise of multi-modal imaging studies and the proliferation of derived measures available from each modality, very little work has explored relationships between modalities. Notably, brain structure and function evolve dramatically in the context of adolescent brain development, but typical analyses usually evaluate each imaging phenotype separately. We propose to develop tools for measuring relationships between brain imaging phenotypes provided by disparate imaging modalities. Covariance structures at the subject level will allow identification of local relationships between measures, through weighted regressions and singular value decomposition-based techniques. These techniques will be extended to accommodate any number of imaging modalities and incorporate repeated measures. We will use extensive test-retest data provided by the Consortium of Reproducibility and Reliability (CORR) for validation, and to identify coupling measures that are particularly reliable. The rich multi-modal imaging data and associated clinical phenotypes from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) will allow us to delineate how inter- modal coupling evolves in normal brain development, and also establish how such relationships are altered in association with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. This proposal builds upon established collaboration between the PIs and capitalizes on their complimentary expertise in imaging statistics, developmental neuroimaging, psychopathology, and intimate familiarity with the PNC dataset. Upon completion, this project will provide powerful new tools for the neuroscience community, as well as novel insights regarding brain development and early psychosis-spectrum symptoms."
"9460343","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health problem affecting over 5 million people in the US. Patients with AD have beta-amyloid (A?) and tau pathology and typically present with memory loss. However, approximately 25% of AD subjects do not present with early memory loss and instead present with other cognitive complaints, and are referred to as atypical AD. The most common atypical AD syndromes include logopenic aphasia (LPA), a language syndrome, and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), a visuospatial/perceptual syndrome. The biological underpinnings of these atypical AD syndromes are unclear. The goal of this R01 is to use longitudinal molecular PET (A? and tau-PET imaging) and structural MRI to assess the relationship between A? and tau deposition and structural brain damage in LPA, PCA and typical AD, with the ultimate goal of increasing our understanding of disease biology in these syndromic variants of AD. These analyses will also allow the assessment of neuroimaging biomarkers of disease progression that could be useful in future clinical trials. To accomplish our aims we will recruit 60 subjects that fulfill clinical criteria for LPA (n=30) or PCA (n=30) and show A? deposition on PET imaging. Each subject will undergo two serial assessments 24 months apart that will include neurological and neuropsychological testing, 3T structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging, Pittsburgh Compound B PET and tau-PET performed with the AV-1451 ligand. These subjects will be compared to typical AD and cognitively normal cohorts already followed at Mayo Clinic. The regional distribution of A? and tau deposition, and change in protein deposition over time, will b assessed for LPA, PCA and typical AD. The relationship between protein deposition and grey matter atrophy and white matter tract degeneration will also be assessed. Region-level measures will then be generated from each imaging modality and statistical modelling will be used to determine what regions, or combinations of regions, provides the optimum biomarkers of disease progression. Biomarkers will be validated by generating sample size estimates for clinical trials and assessing the relationship with cognitive decline. Our R01 will have a major impact on public health since atypical AD effects ~1,000,000 Americans. Our research will increase understanding of disease biology and progression in LPA and PCA and provide biomarkers which will allow the inclusion of these subjects in future trials."
"9519783","Computerized cognitive interventions (CCIs) have been increasingly widely implemented among older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the efficacy of CCIs in maintaining or improving older adults' cognitive and functional health has been modest and highly variable. Older individuals' attitudes toward technology use may help explain some of the variability in CCI effects. The goal of this R21 is to generate proof-of-concept for an intervention that may improve attitudes toward computers among those with MCI, in turn improving engagement with and efficacy of a subsequent CCI. Person-centered care?that is, integrating individuals' preferences throughout the process of intervention--has improved intervention engagement among older persons, including those with MCI. A recent intervention predicated on this person-centered approach is called ?multi-functional interactive computer systems? (MICS). MICS involve a database of individualized computer-led leisure activities. Our recent pilot data in assisted living facilities suggest that MICS promotes psychological well-being among older persons with MCI, and may shift computers from dauntingly complex or personally irrelevant devices to familiar, enjoyable technology. These results are consistent with a number of theories indicating that exposure to pleasurable experiences with an object or task improves several dimensions of attitudes, including affective and cognitive components, as well as behavior and motivation. Grounded in both this pilot data and the theory around it, we seek to take the next step in an arc of research ultimately intended to improve the efficacy of CCIs. We propose a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess whether an initial period of MICS, followed by a standard CCI, improves a) attitudes toward computers, b) engagement with the CCI, and c) cognitive outcomes, compared to an attention control period followed by CCI. Our design involving stratified random assignment of 50 assisted living residents with MCI from 4 assisted living facilities to these two groups. The initial phase involves 4 weeks of either attention control or MICS, a ?dose? suggested by prior work on attitude change and computers, followed by 6 weeks of CCI for both groups (a period our prior work indicates is sufficient for change in key cognitive domains among this population). We partner with New York Foundation for Quality Care, who manages the assisted living facilities and with whom we have successfully collaborated. This application is the first of which we are aware striving to augment CCIs, which are now ubiquitous, by addressing an attitudinal or affective element of the person, which are often ignored in the cognitive intervention literature. The adjuvant of MICS also answers increasing calls for ?personalized? or ?person-centered? behavioral interventions with older persons. We thus feel that the study's impact upon the rapidly developing field of CCIs is potentially high, and ideal for the ?high-risk high-reward? or proof-of-concept spirit of the exploratory, developmental R21 mechanism. Support for study hypotheses would form the foundation for a subsequent R01 taking the approach to full scale."
"9473618","ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY In this proposal we explore the transition from preclinical to symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD) by incorporating the novel tau imaging tracer ([18F]-AV-1451) within the biomarker-rich protocol of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN). We leverage the existing infrastructure of DIAN and a collaboration with Avid Radiopharmaceuticals to initiate tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in this unique cohort. DIAN provides fundamental support to the hypothesis that AD consists of a preclinical stage in which accumulation of beta-amyloid (A?) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) gradually lead to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment. However, key gaps remain in our understanding of the temporal and spatial interactions that occur between A? and tau during the transition from preclinical to clinical symptoms. This proposal answers these fundamental questions through three aims. Aim 1 studies the temporal dynamics of tau deposition (using AV-1451) in relation to estimated years to symptom onset (EYO) and existing biomarkers in DIAN (including cerebrospinal fluid, neuroimaging, and cognitive performance). Aim 2 studies the spatial (both local and distributed) changes of tau deposition (using AV-1451). Aim 3 studies the relationship between in vivo tau deposition (using AV-1451) and neuropathology. Unique to autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), the young age of the DIAN participants eliminates overlap with potential age-related neuropathology or tauopathy (PART). Our overall hypothesis is that conversion from cognitively normal to symptomatic AD can be accurately predicted by neuroimaging biomarkers, in particular by AV-1451 PET. Results from this proposal are fundamental for our understanding of PET tau as not only a diagnostic indicator of disease but also a therapeutic marker to evaluate the clinical efficacy of future interventions in ADAD."
"9498388","Project Summary Normal postnatal lung morphogenesis and repair after injury requires the precise coordination of cellular activities and matrix remodeling for the formation or restoration of normal alveolar structures and optimal respiratory efficiency. We recently identified a critical role for the protease, Chymotrypsin-like elastase 1 (Cela1), in the regulation of postnatal lung elastance and its critical role in the pathogenesis of ?1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency. This program of research is based on our novel preliminary findings that Cela1 expression is induced during regenerative and pathological alveolar remodeling, and that inhibition of Cela1 activity prevents AAT deficiency related emphysema. This proposal will identify the role of Cela1 in both physiological and pathologic remodeling in the postnatal lung. Based on data that Cela1 expression is dysregulated in hyperoxic lung injury, Aim 1 will define cell-specific roles for Cela1 in lung development using conditional deletion models to identify Cela1-expressing cells and characterize dynamic changes in expression during development under normal and hyperoxic conditions. Aim 2 will test whether cell-specific expression of Cela1 changes in pathological lung matrix remodeling and whether targeting Cela1 can protect against emphysema long-term. Using lineage tracing and proximity ligation in situ hybridization in an AAT-deficient emphysema model, we will determine whether Cela1-expressing ATII cells represent a unique epithelial cell subclass or if all ATII cells can express Cela1 in the appropriate context. In Aim 3, whether AAT neutralization of Cela1 is required for cellular uptake will be tested, and the cells involved in this uptake and recycling of AAT-Cela1 complexes will be identified using lineage tracing, proximity ligation in situ hybridization, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry. The association among Cela1 gene expression and regions of elastin remodeling will be identified in human AAT deficient emphysema specimens. Lastly, site of Cela1-AAT molecular interaction will be defined. From a scientific and clinical standpoint, this proposal will define a novel critical mechanisms by which Cela1 mediates matrix remodeling processes to regulate normal alveolarization and regeneration after injury that will provide a strong rationale to explore Cela1 as a target for development of future therapies for interstitial lung diseases."
"9438521","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Metabolic health is critically dependent on tropic actions by the adipokine leptin, which programs the hypothalamus during perinatal development to receive normal metabolic signals. Anterior pituitary somatotropes are dependent on leptin for normal metabolic functions, however, the developmental timing of this leptin dependency and underlying mechanisms represent a gap in our knowledge of leptin's broader roles. The overall objective of this application is to ascertain the importance of the neonatal surge of leptin to somatotrope maturation. Our first hypothesis states that normal somatotrope maturation is dependent on perinatal leptin signals and that lack of early leptin signals alters adult somatotrope functions. Our second hypothesis states that leptin regulates somatotropes through effector pathways involving the POU1F1/PIT1 transcription factor, the mRNA translational control protein, Musashi (MSI) and regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs). Two aims will test these hypotheses: Aim 1 studies will determine how the loss of leptin signals impacts neonatal maturation of somatotropes and their metabolic functions in the adult. We will study the neonatal development of somatotropes in animal models in which leptin signals are either: 1) deleted following the somatotrope- selective ablation of Lepr exon 1; 2) blocked by a leptin antagonist during the leptin surge or 3) attenuated by maternal undernutrition. We will replace neonatal leptin in the undernourished animals to test the hypothesis that early leptin signaling is vital for neonatal maturation of somatotropes and their normal function in the adult. Aim 2 studies will identify mechanisms underlying the leptin regulation of somatotropes. These studies will use purified populations of somatotropes to determine if leptin's actions are mediated by signaling pathways that attenuate MSI-mediated repression of Pou1f1, Tsh, and Prl mRNAs. We will also study miRNA-mediated repression of Gh and Ghrhr mRNAs and will employ unbiased approaches to identify additional novel leptin-dependent mechanisms controlling somatotrope maturation. This contribution is significant because it addresses the global problem of the importance of leptin in the prevention of the metabolic dysfunction caused by maternal undernutrition, which contributes to 11% of the total global disease burden, ultimately leading to 35% of child deaths. The proposed research is conceptually innovative because it broadens our understanding of leptin actions to include cells in the anterior pituitary that are known to be important metabolic sensors, and introduces novel regulatory pathways for leptin and utilizes methodological advancements in the purification of somatotropes. The expected outcomes of the work are that (1) the findings will fully inform the field about leptin's tropic role in somatotrope maturation and function and (2) this work will provide information about mechanisms of leptin's action that may be targeted therapeutically to prevent the severe metabolic dysfunction caused by early leptin deficiency."
"9520115","OVERALL: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Berkeley Superfund Research Center, in consultation with the Program's key stakeholders, has identified four complex problems associated with hazardous waste sites that have proven intractable to current methods. These problems are how to better assess: 1) cumulative impacts from multiple environmental stressors (e.g. chemical exposures, stress and obesity); 2) past exposures, especially early-life exposures and their contribution to risk; 3) the effects of chemical mixtures and their impact on remediation efforts; and, 4) the complex transformation of chemicals to reactive intermediates and their ability to act through multiple mechanistic pathways. Here we propose six interactive projects (4 biomedical and 2 engineering) and 5 cores that aim to address these four problems though original research, translation to appropriate end-users and community engagement efforts. We will focus on exposures to high priority chemicals commonly found at Superfund sites, including arsenic, benzene, trichloroethene, formaldehyde, chromium and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to address the specific mandates of the Program. We will, however, take a novel approach in adopting the so-called `exposome paradigm' in our research. This new paradigm, which we helped develop, allows for a `seeing the whole picture' approach to risk assessment, hazard identification and the safe and effective remediation of hazardous sites containing multiple chemicals. In the exposome paradigm all non- genetic environmental stressors are considered as environmental exposures. Therefore, cumulative risk assessment, where the impact of all stressors on a population is assessed, could be operationalized by exposomics. Communities living near sites face cumulative risks from a variety of environmental and social factors. The theme of our Center is therefore the exposome and we propose a step-wise approach to applying exposomics to help solve the complex problems found at Superfund sites. Biomedical Projects 1-4 aim to develop advanced techniques for the detection, assessment, and evaluation of the effects and risk to human health of hazardous substances; Engineering Project 5 will develop methods to detect new hazardous substances in the environment and together with Engineering Project 6 will develop methods to reduce the amount and toxicity of hazardous substances. A Community Engagement Core C (CEC) will address contaminated drinking water problems in California in collaboration with Projects 1, 5 and 6 and Core E, a Data Science and Laboratory Core that will assist researchers and the CEC in meeting their goals. A Research Translation Core C will facilitate interactions between investigators and key stakeholders and a Training Core D will develop the next generation of multidisciplinary professionals. The overall goal is to enhance understanding of the relationship between exposure and disease; provide usable tools to improve human health risk assessments; and, develop a range of prevention and remediation strategies to protect public health and the environment. The program will be overseen and coordinated by an Administration Core A."
"9491626","Small Animal Studies Core Shared Resource ABSTRACT The Small Animal Studies Core (SASC) combines the resources available through the previously reviewed Small Animal Imaging Core with a new Animal Tumor Models component. This combined resource provides exceptional quality services for City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (COHCCC) members for basic and translational preclinical studies in cancer biology, anti-cancer drug development, and stem cell therapeutic development. The Small Animal Imaging component of the SASC provides consultation, advanced imaging equipment, imaging services, hands-on training for COHCCC members, and support for protocol and grant preparation. Current systems in the Imaging Laboratory include two units for bioluminescence/fluorescence optical imaging (Ami X and Lago X from Spectral Instruments Imaging) and a PET/SPECT/CT trimodal scanner (Inveon from Siemens). These systems support molecular-based imaging to allow for the monitoring of cellular processes and the non-invasive assessment of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of therapeutic agents. Often the imaging techniques and targeting agents utilized are directly transferable to the clinical setting. The Animal Tumor Models component of the SASC has established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of breast, colorectal, lung, sarcoma, and gastric cancers in collaboration with COHCCC physician scientists and has developed next-generation humanized mouse models for research in cancer immunotherapy and in vivo drug metabolism/toxicity studies. The development of PDX models supports precision medicine by allowing investigators to evaluate tumor growth and therapeutic response for individual patients. The Animal Tumor Models component also provides specialized drug delivery services, training for in vivo procedures, and support for protocol preparation and grant development. The SASC is co-directed by Dr. David Colcher, a Professor in the Department of Molecular Immunology, and Dr. Jun Wu, an Associate Research Professor of Comparative Medicine, and is supported by highly qualified staff that maintain and operate the instrumentation. Oversight is provided by an interdisciplinary faculty Advisory Committee, and user feedback through an annual survey. The SASC occupies three rooms within the 29,000 sq. ft. Parvin Building for animal experiments and two rooms in Huntington Lab for tumor cell and reagent preparation. iLab software is used to schedule services, monitor instrument use, and manage billing within the SASC. Over the previous five years, the SASC was used by 80 unique investigators, including 58 CC members. Of the 58 CC members, 48 (83%) had peer-reviewed funding. As of this report, the SASC provides ongoing support to 12 NIH-funded projects totaling $5.6M per year in direct costs to the COHCCC."
"9429336","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Most deaths are preventable through early detection, but failures of screening completion and quality substantially impair test effectiveness. This proposal unites the productive PROSPR I CRC Centers into a single collaboration to address key questions and pilot interventions to improve CRC screening outcomes. In PROSPR I, we developed a strong transdisciplinary, multisite collaboration. We collected 316 data elements, performed validation studies, created high-quality pooled data sets to identify patient, provider, and system gaps in the CRC screening process factors and published >60 manuscripts. Our unified PROSPR II Research Center (PRC) will use these proven collaborations and >10 years of longitudinal data for >8.9 million screen-eligible people (~ 1 of 40 eligible people in the US), large numbers of screening exposures (>8.4 million fecal immunochemical tests [FIT] and >1.9 million colonoscopies), and outcomes (>28,000 CRCs). Our PRC is geographically, demographically and economically diverse (three states, >800,000 African Americans, 1.6 million Hispanics, and 1 million Asian Americans). The health systems have different CRC screening patterns, different modalities, and include all major insurance/reimbursement methods (safety net, Medicare, Medicaid, high-deductible and pre-paid/fee-for-service, staff-model and incentivized providers).  Our PROSPR I research identified major deficiencies in three areas of CRC screening: who should get screening and surveillance and when; why people do not complete recommended screening, surveillance or follow-up of positive tests; and how test quality and accuracy can be improved. Project 1 will identify on whom and when screening should be performed, particularly for those with conflicting recommendations (e.g., African Americans aged 40-49 years, and patients 76-85 years old). Project 2 will evaluate when surveillance should occur after a precancerous polyp diagnosis, using baseline colonoscopy results and precise new 10-year risk estimates for CRC. Project 3 will explore long-term screening patterns and multilevel drivers of why screening and surveillance are not appropriately completed, especially in understudied patients who never screen, fail to re-screen, use surveillance inappropriately or fail to follow up after a positive screening test. Project 4 will evaluate how to increase the effectiveness of FIT and colonoscopy by optimizing age- and sex-stratified quantitative FIT abnormal ranges, establishing precise adenoma detection thresholds for quality improvement and evaluating drivers of adenoma detection. We will use results from these observational studies, behavioral science methods, and stakeholder involvement to develop and pilot test multilevel interventions. Our transdisciplinary team of scientists, physicians, and healthcare experts will also provide leadership and data for trans-PROSPR, multiple-organ collaborations. The proposed research can substantially decrease the burden of CRC by reducing disparities and identifying ways to improve screening completion and effectiveness."
"9488895","Project Summary Numerous reports by the National Research Council of the National Academies of Science have argued for increased efforts to expand the number of veterinarians in research careers. Veterinary students receive extensive training in the comparison of multiple animal species and the application of knowledge across species boundaries. As such, veterinarians are well attuned to the identification of animal models that might serve as models of human disease. Veterinarians are also adept at understanding mechanisms of infectious disease spread as the majority of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic. However, a relatively small number of veterinarians are actively involved in biomedical research. Exposure of veterinary students, early in their training, to biomedical research has been shown to increase the numbers of veterinarians who pursue biomedical research careers. For the past 27 years the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, has administered a short-term summer research program for first and second year veterinary students to participate in research training. This program has enabled 404 different veterinary students to perform biomedical research with 161 different faculty members at Penn. Veterinary students, with the help of an executive committee, identify faculty sponsors at Penn. A core of 31 well funded and experienced faculty serve as training mentors. Students write a research proposal that is well defined and addresses an interesting problem in biomedical research. Applications are reviewed with respect to the credentials of the student, merit of the research proposal, and training environment of the sponsor's laboratory. Students perform research in the mentor's laboratory during the months of June, July, and August and participate in weekly seminars that provide training in grant writing, data presentation in written, poster and oral formats, and information on career opportunities in academia, industry, and government. Students also participate in trips to NIH, the Philadelphia Science Center, and the Merial-NIH Veterinary Scholars Symposium. Students present their research orally and in poster format, and must submit their work in the form of a written scientific manuscript. Thus students receive training in all aspects of biomedical research. Our outcomes data indicate that Program graduates are much more likely to pursue further education, graduate studies, and research careers, and are much less likely to pursue private practice clinical careers."
"9538018","Abstract Exposure to ionizing radiation is often fatal due to acute radiation syndromes (ARS) manifested as Gastrointestinal-ARS (GI-ARS) and Hematopoietic-ARS (H-ARS). Delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) lead to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). A common denominator of radiation induced multi-organ failure is due to damage to endothelial cells (ECs) and lymphatic ECs, resulting in leakiness, coagulopathy and inflammation, setting up stage for infection, sclerosis and tumorigenesis. The molecular basis of radiation-induced EC dysfunction is not well understood. Our goal is to capitalize on the regenerative function of ECs by intravenously transplanting readily-available, off-the- shelf, allogeneic human ECs to mitigate ARS, DEARE and MODS. Our central hypothesis is that radiation damaged blood vessel and lymphatic ECs become dysfunctional and fail to perform their vascular functions or supply the instructive signals required to promote tissue healing thereby leading to ARS and DEARE. We propose that transplantation of normal pro-regenerative ECs a day or days after radiation can rescue the multi-organ defects of radiation-injured ECs and promote scar-free healing. We have shown that tissue-specific ECs by producing angiocrine growth factors orchestrate the repair of injured organs without fibrosis. Intravenous transplantation of human ECs restores hematopoietic recovery in sublethally irradiated rodents and lethally irradiated pigtail macaque non-human primates (NHP) without fibrosis or tumorigenesis. The Rationale for the proposed experiments is that if we know how to efficiently generate abundant off-the-shelf GMP-grade human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) as a ?generic allogeneic vascular graft?, we will use NHP large animal model radiation models to determine the pharmacokinetics of HUVEC transplantation to use them as a definitive or intermediary radiation countermeasure to support organ repair post-radiation. We will test this hypothesis by addressing these Aims: 1) Manufacture of abundant functional clinical-grade master cell banks of monkey ECs (MUVECs) and human (HUVECs) for intravenous transplantation. 2) Identify the critical parameters for allogeneic/xenogeneic MUVEC and HUVEC transplantation into recipient mice to mitigate post-irradiation H-ARS and GI-ARS injury without provoking fibrosis..3) Employ pigtail macaque NHP radiation models to determine the scheduling, safety and efficacy of transplanting MUVECs and HUVECs to rejuvenate vascular niche for multi-organ repair without scarring. Completion of the proposed studies will enable therapeutic use of allogeneic off-the-shelf ?human ECs? that transiently home to the disrupted vascular beds of irradiated organs restoring angiogenesis and vascular niche functions promoting organ repair, scarring. The success of these studies will provide for a readily available medical counter measure (MCM) for the treatment of acute and chronic radiation syndromes preventing life threatening complications. 1"
"9459312","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bone loss in diabetes has received surprisingly little attention, particularly considering that osteoporosis affects ~20% of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and poor bone quality is also a problem in type 2 diabetes. Bone loss is due to reduced osteoblastic bone formation, not increased osteoclastic resorption, thus, anti- resorptive therapies are inadequate. The molecular mechanisms of defective osteoblast function(s) are not well defined, but may include excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in osteoblasts, and clinical trials suggest that NO donors improve bone mineral density in post- menopausal women; however, conventional NO donors enhance oxidative stress. We previously showed that the NO/cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) signaling pathway regulates osteoblast proliferation and survival. We found increased NADPH oxidase (NOX4) expression, excess ROS generation, decreased NO/cGMP production, and reduced PKG expression in bones and osteoblasts from mice with streptozotocin-induced T1DM, compared to control mice. Treatment with the cGMP-elevating agent cinaciguat, which is active even under high oxidative stress, largely restored defective proliferation and differentiation in diabetic (pre)osteo- blasts, and improved bone formation and trabecular bone volume in mice with T1DM. We hypothesize that defective NO/cGMP/PKG signaling-secondary in part to oxidative damage of pathway enzymes-contributes to bone loss in diabetes; restoring NO/cGMP signaling and/or reducing oxidative stress could be effective treatment(s) for diabetes-associated osteoporosis. The Specific Aims are to: (i) determine mechanisms and consequences of impaired NO/cGMP/PKG signaling in diabetic (pre)osteoblasts; (ii) analyze effects of cGMP- elevating agents on diabetes-induced bone loss in vivo; and (iii) examine the role of PKG and NOX4 in diabetes-induced bone loss. We will study the effects of diabetes on NO synthase and guanylate cyclase oxidation and post-translational modifications, and on PKG transcriptional regulation in osteoblasts. We will compare several approaches to prevent bone loss in mice with T1DM by treating the mice with: (i) cinaciguat; (ii) cobinamide, a vitamin B12 analog and potent anti-oxidant; (iii) the novel NO donor nitrosyl-cobinamide, which generates cobinamide on releasing NO; and (iv) combinations of cobinamide and cinaciguat. We will analyze the drugs' effects on bone formation and architecture, with micro-CT, histomorphometry, biomechanical testing, and gene expression profiling, and compare their effects on proliferation, differentiation, and survival of diabetic (pre)osteoblasts ex vivo. We will determine if mice expressing constitutively-active PKG1/2 and NOX4 knock-out mice are protected from diabetic bone loss, and examine if insulin mediates bone-protective effects via PKG, using (pre)osteoblast-specific PKG1/2 knock-out mice. These studies could be paradigm shifting, because they may define a novel mechanism for diabetic bone loss and provide a rational basis for testing cGMP-elevating drugs in diabetic osteoporosis, where they could provide a novel, anabolic treatment strategy."
"9529036","Abstract Despite overwhelming evidence that the immune system plays a significant role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis, information about the role of the immune system in human patients is lacking. Our preliminary data show that natural killer (NK) cells are upregulated in the blood of ALS patients. NK cells function as the innate immune analogs of adaptive CD8 T cells. These cells can also skew immune polarization or directly lyse infected and/or dying cells (NK) without the aid of antigen presenting cells. NK cell numbers are increased in the spinal cord of ALS mice, and other innate lymphoid cells have been previously shown to contribute to ALS progression. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that the motor neurons of ALS mice lack major histocompatibility complex 1 (MHCI) expression; this is important as MHCI expression protects cells from NK cell-mediated death. Unlike anti-inflammatory cell types that are currently being studied for use in ALS therapeutics, such as regulatory T cells, NK are purely pro-inflammatory and can be targeted in the blood using methods of depletion; thus, the purpose of this proposal is to determine the role of NK cells in driving ALS, with the long-term goal of developing future therapeutics. We hypothesize that NK cells contribute to ALS pathology by accelerating motor neuron death and by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-?, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor that can skew downstream immune responses in the CNS. We therefore propose two Specific Aims which will assess the role of NK cells in both mouse and man. In the first Aim, we will deplete NK cells in ALS mice using commercially available antibodies to determine whether the absence of NK cells delays disease onset and slows progression. In the second Aim we will isolate NK and innate lymphoid cells from the blood of ALS patients and show using flow cytometry and qPCR that these cells are more prone to inflammatory cytokine production. We will also analyze the kinetics of NK cell accumulation and cytokine production by taking monthly blood draws from a cohort of ALS patients. These data will then be matched to clinical metrics of disease progression to demonstrate correlation between NK cells and ALS. Overall, completion of these studies will have considerable impact on both our understanding of the role of these cells in ALS pathogenesis and their potential as a therapeutic target."
"9425854","Project Summary/Abstract  Significant effort has been put toward developing therapies targeted at amyloid-? peptide (A?), the hallmark toxic aggregatory protein associated with AD. Unfortunately, A? targeted therapies have resulted in several costly Phase III clinical failures. This research focuses on developing novel cognition enhancing agents which do not directly target A? but may reverse the effects of A? on cognitive function and provide neurorestorative effects by up-regulating neurogenic gene products.  Nitric oxide (NO) mimetics activate an intracellular 2nd messenger known as soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) leading to increased cyclic GMP (cGMP) production and increased phosphorylation/activation of cAMP response element binding protein- CREB (pCREB). CREB phosphorylation is recognized as being a crucial regulator of synaptic plasticity, resulting in the production of pro-growth gene products, such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and enhanced synaptic transmission. NO/cGMP/CREB signaling is disrupted in AD via A?-mediated inhibition of NO-induced CREB phosphorylation and synaptic plasticity. Reversal of A? induced memory impairment via agents which activate NO/cGMP signaling results in improved cognitive function. Hence, NO/cGMP activating agents show potential for the treatment of AD.  Furoxans are a class of thiol-dependent NO mimetics which may hold potential as novel neurorestorative therapies. Furoxans are distinct because they exhibit `tunable' NO mimetic effects. A unique molecular structure distinguishes furoxans from classical NO mimetic nitrates and makes it possible to engineer molecules with significantly reduced rates of NO mimetic activity. HPLC-MS/MS analysis reveals that furoxan reactivity can be manipulated in a predictable manner to avoid the adverse systemic hypotensive side-effects associated with transient fluxes of NO. Preliminary studies indicate furoxans have good brain penetration, neuroprotective activity, and cognition enhancing effects via NO/cGMP/CREB signaling.  This project represents a hit-to-lead optimization campaign for the development of furoxans as novel agents for AD. Our approach includes- 1) synthesis of novel analogs and preliminary screening in PC12 cells for protection against oxidative stress; 2) Counter screening active analogs in a focused in vitro pharmacokinetic battery; 3) validating efficacy to improve synaptic function (ex vivo LTP experiments) and protect primary cortical neurons from A? induced toxicity; 4) a focused PK/PD study to define a relationship between orally administered furoxan, unbound furoxan in the hippocampus, and engagement of NO/cGMP signaling. A brief dose escalation study will confirm that furoxans do not affect systemic blood pressure or possess acute toxicity prior to conducting a pilot in vivo efficacy in 3xTg transgenic AD mice. Primary outcomes focus on the ability to improve spatial working and contextual fear memory in 3xTg mice."
"9519490","PROJECT SUMMARY  Attention is a set of core cognitive functions that supports purposeful behaviors. Attention is necessary for accomplishing daily activities such as locating groceries at a shop, ingredients in the kitchen, car keys on the desk, or a friend at a party. One mechanism of attention that supports these behaviors involves the maintenance of information about the task goal, or the target objects, within an attentional template over time. The concept of a template is ubiquitous in models of attention, but little is known about its mechanisms. Recent evidence suggests that there is considerable variability in the quality and contents of information held in the template over time and individuals. The purpose of this proposal is to understand why that occurs, and the consequences of variability on behavioral performance. We will build convergent evidence using a combination of methods including: behavioral testing of individuals across the full spectrum of attentiveness, fMRI patterns and network analyses in healthy young adults, and behavioral testing of patients with prefrontal lesions due to stroke."

The KL2 Mentored Career Development Program (KL2 Program) will engage talented and motivated scholars in any health science discipline (including medicine, nursing, dental, pharmacy, public health) to join the clinical and translational science workforce to develop new diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic interventions for diseases with emphasis on addressing health disparities affecting our communities. We will train scholars to use an interdisciplinary approach to translate basic and clinical advances into improved healthcare. We will develop an ethnic/racial/culturally diverse workforce to overcome the growing divide between clinical and research careers, and to address health inequities in communities such as Buffalo. Buffalo is the 3rd poorest city in the country, where over 50% of its population belongs to traditional underrepresented [(AA (39%), HA (11%), NA/PI (0.8%)] (2010 Census) and/or underserved minorities. Refugees represent over 5% of the Buffalo population. The goal of this KL2 Program is to train at least four junior faculty/physician scientist scholars by supporting them for two years with the expectation that, with training and mentor assistance, they secure an additional three years of individual funding through K awards to complete the five-year training program. The program is complemented by and integrated with an institutionally funded Dean's Scholars program, which allows us to train 6 additional scholars under the same terms. There will be 5 scholars in the program in Years 1 and 2 and 10 thereafter. We will focus on recruiting individuals from underrepresented backgrounds in health science professions. The program has four specific aims: 1) Attract, engage, and train in state-of-the-art clinical and translational science and a broad range of health science disciplines talented and motivated early career investigators who come from underrepresented groups or disadvantaged backgrounds and/or bring new perspectives to health disparities challenges; 2) Develop comprehensive mentoring programs for mentors and trainees tailored to individual needs; 3) Promote pathways to independence by fostering inter-professional and inter-disciplinary training for scholars to master team science concepts; and 4) Empower our Community of Scholars to collaborate and identify new areas of engagement with other CTSA hubs. The program will train and develop KL2 Scholars' professional skills and facilitate a seamless transition to their next career level within the clinical and translational workforce pipeline. KL2 Scholars, as leaders of the CTSA Community of Scholars, will have the opportunity to give back by providing mentoring and guidance in the discipline to students and peers from our community, the region, and nationwide through the CTSA consortium."
"9454522","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed research is to identify factors associated with positive language, literacy, and academic outcomes in children from Spanish-speaking homes and, thereby, to provide a scientific basis for public policy and educational practices aimed at supporting the development and achievement of language minority children. One in 5 children in the U.S. live in homes where a language other than English is spoken; among school-aged children, 79% of these homes are Spanish-speaking. Many children in this population reach school age with low levels of English language skills, and they do not catch up to the skill level required for success in school in time to avoid serious academic disadvantage. Low levels of literacy and academic achievement are associated with higher rates of disease, mental illness, unemployment, and contact with the criminal justice system, making literacy and academic achievement among this large and growing segment of the population a national health concern. The proposed research is a continuation of a longitudinal study of children from Spanish-speaking homes and children from monolingual English- speaking homes that began when the children were 2 1/2 years old and has followed them, thus far, to the age of 5 years and the point of school entry. The new work will assess the children's language environments, dual language and literacy development, and executive function skill growth from age 6 to 10. Scores on school-administered assessments of academic achievement are additional outcomes measured in the 3rd and 4th grade. The specific aims are (1) to describe language and literacy trajectories in English and Spanish across the transition to school and to assess the relation of early dual language experience, early dual language development, and concurrent home and school influences to individual differences in those trajectories, (2) to test the hypotheses that strong Spanish skills and strong executive function skills are protective factors in children from language minority homes that mitigate the risk for poor literacy and academic achievement associated with low English skills at school entry, and (3) to test the hypothesis that children with low English and low Spanish skills are particularly a risk and to identify antecedents of low risk and high risk skill profiles. The results of the proposed research will allow identification of language minority children most at risk for low levels of English literacy and academic achievement and will identify targets for interventions aimed at enhancing literacy and related health and academic outcomes in children from language minority homes. The proposed analyses will not exhaust the usefulness of the database that will result from this work. That database will include detailed measures of dual language environments and dual language skill growth from the age of 2 1/2 to 10 years, with measures of executive control, literacy, and academic achievement during elementary school, for 130 children from Spanish-speaking families and 30 children from monolingual English-speaking families.

Recombination hotspots, where genome rearrangements initiate at incongruently higher frequencies, are significantly enriched with repetitive sequence elements with the potential to fold into non-helical DNA secondary structures. When left unresolved, such DNA structures can impede transcription and replication leading to genome instability. G-quadruplex or G4 DNA is a tetra-helical structure consisting of runs of guanines and one of the DNA structures that presents a challenge to normal DNA transactions. Comprehensive understanding of how a subset of the guanine run- containing sequences interspersed in the genome becomes genetically unstable, however, is still lacking. Also not understood is how such potential hotspots of genome instability are kept under control. The long-term research goal of the applicant is to better understand how spontaneous mutagenesis and rearrangements occur at disparate rates throughout the genome. The goal of the proposed research is to characterize what potentiates the marked elevation in instability associated with certain guanine-run containing sequences in the model eukaryote, S. cerevisiae. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that genome instability at a G4 motif is contingent on both genomic context and trans-acting factors that modulate the structural transformation of a guanine-run containing sequence into G4 DNA structure. This hypothesis is founded on the preliminary data generated by the applicant that identified two critical factors in modulating instability at a model G4 DNA- forming sequence ? the level of transcription and the activity of topoisomerase I. Our specific aims are designed to (1) define the role of topoisomerase I in the G4 DNA-associated genome instability (2) test whether DNA damage cooperatively aggravates the instability of G4 forming sequences and (3) Identify proteins binding specifically to co-transcriptionally formed G4 DNA in vivo. In combination with molecular approaches to detect G4 DNA in vivo, genetic assays developed for quantitative measurement of recombination occurring at a G4 motif in transcription-dependent manner will be employed in AIM 1 and 2 to determine the effect of disruption in Top1 function and accumulation of DNA damage on the stability of co- transcriptionally formed G4 DNA. The genetic assays have proved effective and productive in generating the relevant preliminary data. Under AIM3, novel trans-activating factors with possible roles in suppressing instability at the G4 DNA will be identified by chromatin affinity purification approach. The stability of G4 motifs is particularly relevant to the biology of cancer since there is a significant overlap between genomic loci containing G4 sequences and the sites of translocations observed in various human cancers. The result of the proposed study can ultimately enhance our understanding of the molecular events instigating the tumorigenic rearrangements as well as therapy-related secondary malignancy or drug-resistant tumor development."
"9452872","Project Summary/Abstract. Nighttime agitation, defined as the appearance or exacerbation of behavioral disturbances, such as wandering and aggression, in the afternoon and/or evening, is a prevalent symptom in persons with Alzheimer?s disease that reduces their quality of life and restricts their environments. Effective treatments are lacking. One major cause for past failure of treatments has been the approach of treating all nighttime agitation alike. Unlike interventions in the past, our precision medicine approach tailors the intervention to a specific sleep disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS). RLS occurs in 10-14% of older adults and it is likely that persons with Alzheimer?s disease have RLS, since it is quite common, but it is infrequently identified because diagnosis is dependent on patients answering complex questions about their symptoms. RLS causes an urge to move associated with uncomfortable and unpleasant leg sensations. The urge to move and leg discomfort only occur or worsen at night, and relief is by movement. We hypothesized that RLS might be an etiology for nighttime agitation because: 1) circadian patterns of nighttime agitation and RLS symptoms are almost identical; 2) unrelieved RLS discomfort may precipitate behaviors such as screaming and requests for help, and the urge to move may cause wandering, pacing, and restlessness; and 3) factors common in institutionalized persons with Alzheimer?s disease, such as anemia, prolonged bed rest, and antidepressants, trigger or worsen RLS. Our preliminary work supports our hypothesis, and provides beginning evidence that RLS may be an unidentified etiology for nighttime agitation. In 59 persons with dementia and nighttime agitation, and RLS diagnosed using objective measures, we found that almost ¼ had RLS and that RLS was associated with nighttime agitation (r = 0.31, p .01). We now propose a pilot clinical trial to determine if RLS treatment reduces nighttime agitation, improves sleep, reduces antipsychotic medications, and the mechanism for these effects. We have chosen gabapentin enacarbil (GEn) as the treatment because it is FDA approved for RLS and has a favorable safety profile. We propose an 8-week, double-blind placebo-controlled randomized pilot trial of GEn versus placebo in 136 nursing home residents with moderate to severe Alzheimer?s disease, nighttime agitation, and RLS, followed by an 8-week post-trial evaluation of antipsychotic medication use. The specific aims are to: 1) Determine the effect of GEn, compared to placebo on nighttime agitation (primary endpoint); 2) Describe the safety profile of GEn compared to placebo in this population; 3) Estimate the effect size of GEn compared to placebo on nighttime sleep, RLS behaviors, and antipsychotic medications; 4) Explore whether frequency of RLS behaviors mediates the effect of GEn on nighttime agitation behaviors. The results of this study and future definitive trials may shift and improve standards of care for treatment of nighttime agitation; reduce elopement, aggression, and other nighttime agitation behaviors; and improve sleep."
"9485203","SUMMARY  Cell motility and contractility depend on tightly controlled assembly of the actin cytoskeleton. Formins are a major group of actin assembly proteins that nucleate and processively elongate actin filaments. The formin homology domain-containing protein (FHOD) family of formins assembles actin-based structures in several biological contexts, including cell motility and sarcomere organization. Mammals have two FHOD proteins, FHOD1 and FHOD3, with largely distinct expression patterns and functions. FHOD1 assembles stress fibers that contribute to the adhesion, spreading, and motility of a wide variety of cell types. FHOD3 is predominantly expressed in striated muscle (skeletal and cardiac), where it is required for sarcomere organization. Altered expression of both FHOD1 and FHOD3 is associated with some cancers and cardiomyopathies. Despite the essential role of FHOD family members, and their relevance to several diseases, the mechanisms by which they carry out these functions remain poorly understood. Advances in this area have been largely limited by the inability to observe actin assembly activity with mammalian FHOD1 or FHOD3 in vitro. In contrast, we found that purified Drosophila FHOD potently accelerates actin assembly. Our ability to combine biochemical characterization of actin assembly with the genetic tractability of Drosophila makes this an attractive model system to study FHOD proteins. Drosophila has a single FHOD gene that is expressed in several distinct motile and contractile cell types, including macrophages, muscle, tracheal tip cells, and imaginal discs. How can the single FHOD gene in Drosophila be responsible for the diverse range of actin-based structures in these tissues? Drosophila FHOD has several splice variants, including four variations in its C-terminal tail. Because the tail modifies the activities of several other formins, we hypothesize that alternative splicing of the Drosophila FHOD tail tunes its activity, allowing each isoform to assemble specific actin structures. We will test this hypothesis by comparing the biochemical activities, expression patterns, and functional requirement of each isoform. The results of this work will provide insight into the role of the formin tail in regulating actin assembly activity, with implications for diseases such as cancers and cardiomyopathies, in which the expression or activity of FHOD proteins is altered. "
"9521128","Abstract: Addictions are among the most heritable of human neuropsychiatric disorders, but human genetic studies have been hampered by the extreme complexity of human genetics, as well as the sheer behavioral complexity of the addictive process, with multiple stages at which humans can exhibit addiction vulnerability ? e.g. initial drug exposure, escalation, relapse, etc. We address these shortcomings by studying heterogeneous stock (HS) rats, which have extremely well characterized genetic profiles, and using behavioral models that examine multiple well-defined time periods in the progression of addictive behaviors. Our preliminary findings show that even though addiction is often viewed as aberrant reward learning, much individual variation in addiction propensity is actually due to differences in avoidance learning. For example, in addition to its well-known rewarding properties, cocaine has aversive effects that show greater individual variability than its rewarding effects, and are stronger predictors of cocaine-seeking. Furthermore, we found that rats differ greatly in ?punishment resistance?, i.e. propensity to seek rewards despite adverse outcomes, which is one of the defining characteristics of addiction. Both cocaine avoidance and punishment resistance are highly heritable in HS rats (h2 = 0.58 and 0.48, respectively), and both are critically regulated by the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), a major GABAergic afferent to midbrain dopamine neurons that plays key roles in avoidance learning. Building on these findings, we seek to identify the genetic differences underlying these two distinct addiction vulnerability phenotypes using a genome-wide association screen (GWAS) to identify candidate genes in HS rats, followed by eQTL analysis on gene expression in the RMTg and afferent circuits that drive these behaviors. This project will identify candidate addiction-related genes using a highly innovative combination of powerful behavioral tests, extensive neural circuitry knowledge, and the Palmer lab's groundbreaking sequencing and analytical approaches."
"9460990","Human aging and a number of age-related diseases are associated with altered protein homeostasis, or proteostasis. Among the critical regulators of proteostasis is autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved membrane trafficking process that degrades a variety of cellular constituents through the lysosome. Autophagy is induced during starvation and calorie restriction, and is essential for maintaining cell and tissue integrity. While autophagy is well-known to degrade cytoplasmic materials, recently I have made the surprising discovery that mammalian autophagy is able to degrade nuclear constituents (Dou et al, Nature, 2015). The autophagy protein LC3 is present in the nucleus and directly interacts with the nuclear lamina protein Lamin B1, and associates with lamin-associated domains (LADs) on chromatin at the genome-wide level. This interaction mediates trafficking and degradation of Lamin B1 and associated heterochromatin, through a nucleus-to- cytoplasm transport process, leading to their digestion in cytoplasmic lysosomes. This lamina and chromatin autodigestion specifically occurs during cellular senescence, a stable form of cell-cycle arrest. Senescence is a specialized cell state in response to oncogene activation, which is beneficial in restraining tumorigenesis; however, senescence is also induced during aging, which contributes to age-related pathologies. I found that inhibiting autophagy or the LC3-Lamin B1 interaction prevents the degradation of Lamin B1 and extends cellular lifespan. These findings provide the first demonstration that mammalian autophagy has functional roles in maintaining homeostasis of the nucleus, suggests a new direction in understanding mammalian aging, and provokes numerous questions to be addressed.  In this proposal, I plan to investigate this new perspective of nuclear autophagy, and to study its impact on chromatin and aging. My central hypothesis is that while autophagic degeneration of chromatin is an intrinsic tumor suppressive mechanism, paradoxically it is improperly adapted during aging and contributes to age-related pathologies. I also hypothesize that specific manipulation of this nuclear pathway of autophagy holds promise in treating age-related diseases. For the K99 phase, I propose to study the role of cytoplasmic chromatin shuttled by autophagy in mediating senescence-associated inflammation (Aim 1). I further propose to investigate this pathway in chronic inflammation as seen in human aging, using in vivo aging models (Aim 2). In the R00 phase, I plan to investigate the autophagic degradation of a chromatin modifier that plays an essential role in longevity (Aim 3), and to identify novel nuclear substrates of autophagy that associate with autophagy proteins and regulate senescence and aging (Aim 4). This study will make pioneering contributions to our understanding of mammalian aging from the perspective of nuclear homeostasis, and may help to identify new pharmaceutical targets in ameliorating age-associated disorders. The proposed training and research will greatly facilitate my transition to an independent tenured-track faculty position."
"9543143","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Translation, i.e. the application of findings from animal experiments to humans, is of central importance for the field of behavioral neuroscience. However, the value of translational research has been challenged by many findings, which show results in animal studies that do not properly replicate in human experiments. Computational psychiatry is a young field that uses computational approaches to advance rigorous mechanistic understanding of the processes that underlie mental health and disease, in part by developing practical applications based on the automated analysis of human data. Computational neuroscience has used a similar approach for animal data. Thus, computational approaches, i.e. quantifying behavioral results in terms of underlying computational models, may have significant utility in translational research. Therefore, we aim to bring together computational researchers with behavioral neuroscience researchers to develop collaborative efforts focused on using computational approaches for translational research. Several important developments have occurred that make this proposed meeting timely: First, clinicians are beginning to recognize the importance of individual differences, brain-behavior relationships and the limitations of traditional means of classifying psychiatric disorders (e.g. DSM). Second, with the advent of new technology, basic researchers are able to better elucidate brain-behavior relationships and knowledge in this regard is increasing at an exponential rate. Nonetheless, there remains a gap between animal models and human behavior, and until that gap is filled, we will continue to make only small strides in identifying successful treatment options for psychiatric illness. The overall goal of this workshop is to identify means to better bridge the gap between animal models of maladaptive behavior and human psychopathology. In order for animal models to provide help with clinical questions, these models will need to have both predictive validity and explanatory power. Some of the key questions that will be addressed are: (1) Can computational approaches be used to develop better ?at risk? animal models? (2) Can computational approaches in animal models be used to disambiguate the contributions of different drugs of abuse to compulsive drug-taking and drug-seeking behaviors? (3) Can computational approaches in animal models improve the predictive validity of novel interventions? The hope is that this workshop will set the stage for future studies to utilize computational methods to bridge the ?translational? gap and thereby improve our strategies for identifying novel therapeutic targets for the successful treatment of addiction and related disorders."
"9490092","Project Summary Liver cancer is a major global health problem, responsible for the 3rd most cancer deaths worldwide. Diagnosis often occurs at late stages, at which point liver tumors have complex tumor/stroma interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The resulting multiscale interactions drive tumor progression and therapeutic response. The proposed project will develop new mathematical/computational techniques to model molecular, cellular, tumor, and organ scales to elucidate the mechanisms driving liver cancer progression and to predict the response to targeted therapeutics. The investigator team is uniquely suited to develop the proposed multiscale models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer. The expertise of the four PIs/PDs is synergistic, combining a state of the art multiscale computational models of cancer (Dr. Popel) with molecular and cellular features inferred from bioinformatics analysis (Dr. Fertig) using state of the art 3D in vitro organoid models (Dr. Ewald) and in vivo mouse models of HCC (Dr. Tran). The well-integrated experimental/computational design of the proposal will result in new algorithms for predictive computational modeling of therapeutic response in HCC. We include extensive experimental studies for model development, parameter tuning, and validation. Specific Aim 1 will infer bioinformatically the signaling pathways important in crosstalk between cancer and stromal cells, integrate models of intracellular signaling and 3D extracellular ligand transport and biochemical reactions and embed them into the cell fate decision rules of an agent-based model of cellular agents resulting in a multiscale hybrid model. The model will be parameterized with phospho- proteomic data under relevant ligand stimulations identified by the bioinformatics analysis and with growth, invasion, proteomic, and genomic data from co-cultured cancer and stromal cells and organoids; independent data will be used for model validation. We will use this model to predict outcomes in a 3D in vitro organoid model of HCC. Specific Aim 2 will extend and adapt this hybrid model to model the tumor microenvironment and to account for the drug pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic, the 3D geometry of the liver, molecular interactions in vivo and cellular composition inferred from bioinformatics analysis. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will develop new bioinformatics analysis algorithms to initialize the model with distribution of cellular agents and molecular states from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) genomic and proteomic data to predict the efficacy of targeted therapeutics in the diverse genetic backgrounds of human liver cancer. The project will develop innovative computational techniques to integrate features at both the molecular and cellular scales from genomics and proteomics analysis with multiscale computational models to predict therapeutic response. The resulting computational algorithms will address the IMAG cutting edge challenge of fusing data-rich and data- poor scales for predictive multiscale computational modeling of biological systems."
"9541270","Project Summary Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations accumulate with age and are present at pathological levels in affected tissues of certain mitochondrial disorders and degenerative diseases (reviewed in [1, 2]). mtDNA mutations are susceptible to mitochondrial quality control, the process of selective autophagy of defective mitochondria, as evidenced by observations that stimulation of mitochondrial autophagy can reduce levels of these mutations in model organisms [3-6] and cell culture [7, 8] and that defects in mitochondrial quality control correlate with increased levels of mtDNA mutations [1, 2, 9]. However, the susceptibility of mtDNA to quality control is poorly understood because it is influenced by multiple complex processes, including the varied sensitivity of quality control to different types of defects in mtDNA gene products, the exchange of gene products between organelles through fission and fusion, the impact of mutations on mtDNA replication, and stochasticity of mtDNA turn-over and inheritance.  The proposed work seeks to understand how the nature of different mtDNA mutations determines whether they tend to increase or decrease in frequency within the cell (this frequency is known as the level of heteroplasmy). To do this, I have developed a simple cell culture system that enables the experimenter to tune the mtDNA mutation rate and copy number per cell, as shown in preliminary data. Using this system, I am generating a library of cells, each containing one or few new mtDNA mutations present at intermediate frequency within the cell. Changes in intracellular frequencies of mutations in response to different treatments, particularly autophagy stimulation, can then be tracked using DNA sequencing. Experiments to elucidate mechanisms mediating these changes take advantage of greatly improved methods of mitochondrial purification recently developed in the Sabatini Lab. The specific aims are: I) To elucidate the prevalence and mechanisms of mtDNA mutations that bias mtDNA replication. II) To understand how mitochondrial quality control acts on different types of mtDNA mutations.  The key novelty of the approach is to measure changes in frequency of many different kinds of mtDNA mutations in high throughput. Prior studies focused on a small set of mutations corresponding to drug resistance markers or relatively-common mitochondrial diseases [12, 13]. In contrast, the goal here is to obtain similar data for thousands of mutations in a single cell type, approaching saturation-level mutagenesis of the ~16.5kb mammalian mitochondrial genome. The proposed work aims to elucidate the factors limiting efficiency of mitochondrial quality control with respect to diverse forms of mtDNA-encoded mitochondrial dysfunction. Understanding these limitations may suggest what renders cells more or less prone to the decline of mitochondrial function in aging, degenerative disease and mtDNA disorders."
"9491640","Developmental Funds ABSTRACT The City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center requests CCSG developmental funds to support pilot research projects and developing an additional new shared resources to strengthen research initiatives and promote basic, translational and clinical science research activities. Funding pilot projects and developing shared resources will collectively enhance the ability of the COHCCC to serve the catchment area and mitigate the impact of cancer in the region. COHCCC believes that these activities will enable the Cancer Center to provide the optimal environment to focus the power of precision medicine, basic science inquiry, drug discovery and development, and behavioral interventions to decrease cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality. The plan for the next funding cycle is to develop a new Multi-Scale Translational Research Core. Multi-scale modeling uses computational analysis to integrate linked measurements made at different scales of measurement (populations, individuals, microenvironment, cells, DNA/RNA/protein, and analytes). Over the past 3 years, the scope City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (COHCCC) Cancer Control and Population Science (CCPS) research has expanded beyond classic epidemiologic testing of associations in large cohorts to biology-focused, translational multi-disciplinary studies that integrate multi-scale data from cohorts with mechanistic mouse-human co-studies, omics (genetics, genomics, proteomics), and analytes (drug levels, endocrine disruptors, carcinogens). The Multi-Scale Translational Research (MSTR) Core in development aims to provide services that facilitate and enhance NCI funded multi-scale research at each level of scale (zip code, individuals, microenvironment, cells, DNA/RNA/protein, and analytes). Multi-scale modeling requires integration of large data sets; to this end, the Core will provide services in data curation, annotation, validation, and assessment of rigor. To support NIH funded COHCCC multi-scale projects, the MSTR Core in development will 1) offer unique services and 2) collaborate and integrate with COHCCC Cores and Caltech, ORIONTM, and TGenTM partners. Unique services offered by the MSTR Core in development include 1) expertise in multi-scale modeling, 2) curation, annotation, and validation of the rigor, reproducibility, and accuracy of tissue, omic, and analyte data, 3) genetic admixture assessment, 4) navigation of existing COH analyte services, 4) expertise in custom tissue engineering and microenvironment studies, 5) cloud-based image storage and sharing services for national and international cohort development. The MSTR in development will deliver this wide range of services through a dedicated team of senior scientists with expertise in precision medicine, tissue engineering, genetic admixture, analyte identification, bioinformatics, and multi-scale modeling."
"9509541","Abstract This application responds to RFA-MH-17-405 Adult Maturational Changes and Dysfunctions in Emotion Regulation. As the RFA notes, aging is associated (for most people) with increasing emotional well-being, emotional stability, and a positivity bias. While these maturational changes are believed to reflect improved emotion regulation skills (like better ways of attenuating sad mood), the literature on emotion regulation strategies and age is decidedly equivocal. Further, little is known about when maturational changes may occur given the scarcity of longitudinal studies and the use of designs, which contrast highly divergent age groups. And it is not known how psychopathology affects presumed adult maturational changes in affect-related skills. We propose to build on a unique sample of Ss, heterogeneous with respect to risk of depressive disorder, who (in prior research studies) repeatedly reported during ages 18-35+ on their emotional well-being and how they attenuate sadness/distress (mood repair); their autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning associated with affect processing was also assessed via peripheral measures. We propose to re-assess n=225 with histories of diagnosed depression and n=200 with no histories of depression once more, and thus extend the data base up to age 59 years, covering middle-age. We will identify latent trajectories of trait mood repair from ages 18 to 59 years and determine its correlates and the effects of personality, treatment exposure and ANS physiologic functioning on class membership. We also will examine the ability to repair mood in the laboratory via two adaptive cognitive regulation strategies: attention-refocusing and neutral reappraisal. Finally, we will use a novel experimental procedure (the Cognitive Effort Discounting Paradigm or COG-ED), which quantifies the subjective cost of cognitive effort (involved in cost-benefit computations to perform a task), to examine the impact of affective load on effort-based decision making. We will test several clearly articulated hypotheses about : i) the effects of depressive illness history and sex on positive maturational effects in mood repair with age, ii) the predictive/moderating values of personality and treatment exposure on age-related mood repair changes, iii) the relations of latent-class mood repair trajectories to sex and shifts in ANS functioning over time; iv) the predictive value of latent-class mood repair trajectories for mood repair success in the laboratory; v) ever-depressed and never-depressed group-related differences on the COG-ED, and vi) the relations of COG- ED performance to mood repair trajectory membership and lab-based mood repair performance via attention refocusing. Our study will fill several gaps in the literature on emotion regulation and aging. It also represents the first step to assess the extent to which a neuro-economic approach to decision making reflects a mechanism that may explain mood repair choices. Findings on mood repair trajectories and COG-ED outcomes have public health implications in the areas of depression prevention and treatment."
"9472239","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The UCSF Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) has made remarkable progress in our first 9 years, developing diagnostic approaches to dementia that are elucidating the phenotypic, genetic and molecular heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The unique clinical cohorts, biospecimens, and images that we collect in the ADRC have facilitated these successes. Talented scientists mentored through our ADRC are making major contributions to the understanding of dementia. ADRC research has steadily increased. We are defining distinctive clinical subtypes of AD, FTD, and CJD that predict specific molecular and physiological mechanisms for dementia, while improving early recognition and tracking of transitions from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. These efforts will continue in parallel with drug development and pursuit of clinical trials with researchers who  work with the ADRC. We will explore the heterogeneous features of AD, FTD-spectrum disorders, and CJD in the early stages with the goal of predicting their physiological, genetic, and molecular underpinnings. We will leverage cohorts in the ADRC and the powerful neuroscience community at UCSF and beyond to stimulate new diagnostic and treatment efforts for AD, FTD and CJD. We will increase understanding of the unique cultural and biological features of aging Chinese-Americans. We will develop innovative approaches to data management and biostatistics that we will share. The Education Core will be responsible for training new dementia leaders, while educating the medical and lay communities about non-AD dementias and non-amnestic subtypes of AD. We will perform three new projects: Project 1: Dr. Gil Rabinovici will compare and contrast early onset AD, late onset AD, and apoE4+ versus apoE4- patients to improve diagnostic accuracy in AD. Project 2: Dr. Marilu Gorno-Tempini will study developmental and immunological factors that influence the phenotype in PPA. Project 3: Dr. Yadong Huang will reprogram human skin fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells and convert them into neurons from E4/E4 or E3/3 patients and healthy controls. Pathological substrates and gene expression will be compared."
"9452111","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult suicide rates in the United States rose by almost 30 percent between 1999 and 2010. These rates have not markedly improved in decades. To date, previous suicide attempts and psychiatric diagnoses are largely the only known clinical risk factors for suicide death. Recent research shows that most individuals who die by suicide make a health care visit in the weeks and months prior to their death. Most of these visits occur in primary care or outpatient medical specialty settings. However, over half of these visits do not include a psychiatric diagnosis. Thus, there is limited evidence available from health care users in the US general population to inform targeted suicide screening and risk identification efforts in general medical settings. New research is needed to investigate the general medical clinical factors associated with suicide risk among individuals without a known risk factor. This research project uses data on more than 4000 individuals who died by suicide and made health care visits to one of eight health care systems across the United States in the year prior to their death. These health systems are members of the Mental Health Research Network and have affiliated health plans. They are able to capture nearly all health care for their patients via the Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW). The VDW consists of electronic medical record and insurance claims data organized using standardized data structures and definitions across sites. These data are matched with official regional mortality data. This project includes the following Specific Aims: 1) Identify the types and timing of clinical factors prior to suicide, 2a) Compare clinical factors before suicide to a matched sample of health care users, 2b) Detect associations between additional clinical factors and suicide, 3) Develop a prediction model of clinical factors prior to suicide, and 4) investigate indicators of hidden mental health need in general medical chart notes prior to suicide. We employ a case-control study approach to test specific hypotheses, while also using novel environment-wide association study methods and latent class analysis to detect new risk factors. We develop a prediction model of clinical factors and suicide. We use qualitative analyses to review clinical text notes and develop a natural language processing algorithm to identify risk. Clinical factors to be studied include medical diagnoses, medications, health care procedures, and types of health care visits. These results will inform decisions about how to focus suicide prevention in medical settings and provide information in response to the 2012 National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention and US Surgeon General report."
"9461108","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal of tuberculosis (TB) drug discovery programs is the development of compounds that will reduce the duration of therapy, simultaneously limiting the emergence of drug-resistant strains of the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The current six-month regimen is thought to result from the inability of existing anti-tuberculars to eliminate a sub-population of Mtb bacilli that are refracory to killing despite retaining full genetic susceptibility to the applied drugs. The existence of thee Mtb persisters, together with the increasing emergence of drug-resistant clinical isolates, in turn raises a critical question: is there a functional link between (non-genetic) persistence and the development of genetic drug resistance? Here, we will test the hypothesis that, by controlling functions involved in DNA repair and damage tolerance, the mycobacterial SOS response plays a key role in the inherent heterogeneity of Mtb populations and, therefore, contributes to the ability of Mtb to persist in the face of lethal stresses including drug treatmen. We will also evaluate the notion that the SOS-regulated imuA'-imuB/dnaE2 mutasome, which was previously implicated in Mtb survival and drug-resistance in vivo, drives mutagenesis in antibiotic-exposed persister populations and so links persistence and genetic resistance. Finally, we will utilize biochemical and target-based whole-cell (TB-WCS) screens to identify novel chemical inhibitors which sensitize Mtb to genotoxic stress and eliminate the emergence of resistance under drug-selective pressure in vitro. This fully collaborative proposal will utilize biochemical, genetic, and microbiological techniques that will require both partners to develop and apply. Moreover, it is predicated on the open transfer of scientific insight and technical expertise as part of a new collaboration designed to create a long-term partnership around the investigation of fundamental aspects of mycobacterial DNA replication and repair as an underexplored target for novel anti-TB agents."
"9443712","Project Summary/Abstract The developing gustatory system is characterized by impressive structural and functional changes. The central taste pathway in rodents is especially plastic during normal development, even at the first synaptic relay. Structurally, the terminations (i.e., terminal fields) of neurons carrying taste information from taste buds to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST) in the medulla are reduced in size, or ?pruned?, to about half of their size -- beginning just before weaning and extending for about 10 days after weaning. Functionally, the period of ?pruning? occurs coincident with the increase in taste-elicited neural activity in gustatory nerves, suggesting a requisite activity-dependent component. Moreover, experimental manipulations of neural activity and the animal?s dietary history during development interrupts the normal ?pruning? of terminal fields, indicating that both activity-dependent and activity-independent factors play a role in the developmental process of circuit refinement. The long-term goal of this project is to understand how the central gustatory system is assembled and then refined by experience. The specific aims of this proposal examine 1) how neurons that innervate single taste buds on the anterior 2/3 of the tongue map onto the NST and how the projections change during normal development and in adult mice that have altered neural activity throughout development or an altered dietary history, and 2) how the neuro-immune molecular cascade operating during normal development is interrupted in mice that have altered neural activity or an altered dietary history. The aims of the project will be addressed through coordinated techniques of single taste bud labels, peripheral taste nerve recordings, central nervous system tract tracing, extensive analyses of synaptic elements at the light and electron microscopic level, and optogenetic recovery of function experiments. These studies will provide new and important information about the development and plasticity of the central gustatory system, the interplay between the immune and gustatory systems during development, and more broadly, they will be useful in determining the role that the maternal diet and taste-elicited activity have on organizing the developing sense of taste."
"9554757","PROJECT SUMMARY In general, men and women experience differing degrees of age-related decreases in physical function, with women having a greater prevalence of functional limitations and disability. A key predictor of this decrease in functional capacity is the reduction in leg muscle maximal power (product of force and velocity), which can be improved with exercise training. However, the development of exercise interventions to optimally improve skeletal muscle function in older adults has been difficult, in part because we now know that men and women respond differently to the same exercise training stimulus. In fact, the fundamental mechanisms by which habitual exercise improves physical function in older adults are still not well understood. The proposed studies, which build upon our recent work, are designed to address these knowledge gaps by examining the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the response to two distinct exercise training paradigms, and determining how these responses differ between older men and women. We hypothesize that molecular, cellular and whole muscle contractile performance will be most improved in men by traditional low-velocity, high-load resistance training, and in women by high-velocity, low-load power training. Moreover, sex-specific structural responses in myofilament remodeling, protein expression and post- translational modifications will explain these sex-specific performance adaptations to each modality. To test our hypotheses, data will be gathered from 50 healthy, sedentary older men and women (65-75 years) prior to and following a 16-week unilateral exercise training program in which one leg undergoes resistance training and the other power training. The Specific Aims of this project are to identify the sex-specific effects of low-velocity resistance training versus high-velocity power training on: Aim 1) skeletal muscle function at the molecular, cellular and whole muscle levels, and Aim 2) protein expression and modification as well as size at the molecular and cellular levels. Our within subject, unilateral intervention design provides a powerful model to minimize the effects of between-subject variability, and our translational approach will take advantage of our unique expertise with state-of-the-art measures from the molecular to whole body levels. Our results will challenge conventional wisdom by determining the sex-specific responses in intrinsic skeletal muscle adaptations to different exercise training programs. We will advance scientific knowledge by providing critically- needed information regarding the specific molecular and cellular determinants that support exercise-induced improvements in muscle performance. This knowledge will have a significant positive impact on the clinical care of older adults by providing novel insight about optimal exercise interventions to improve skeletal muscle function in each sex, and by identifying potential new therapeutic targets for pharmaceutical interventions. Thus, this project is highly relevant to the mission and vision of NIA to support biological research to mitigate conditions associated with aging that may limit health and independence in older adults."
"9557192","Summary This project seeks to prove the commercial feasibility of a new approach to analyzing dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data that would improve sensitivity, quantitative accuracy, and accessibility of imaging the biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent progress in understanding the nature of neurodegenerative diseases ? especially evidence that the onset of cognitive symptoms of AD can be mitigated ?amplify the critical need of improved quantitative evaluation of AD biomarkers. Dynamic PET may be the most accurate modality capable of achieving this goal. However, current strategies of analyzing dynamic PET images either require complex acquisition protocols with invasive arterial blood sampling procedures or rely on accuracy-degrading approximations such as compartment modeling. We have developed Intelligent Dynamics-Driven Quantitative Diagnostics (IDDQD), a novel processing approach based on factor analysis of dynamic structures with partial clustering used to initiate the process. We have shown that an early version of IDDQD can extract blood and tissue tracer dynamics and the corresponding spatial distributions from 11C-PIB PET scans. SolvingDynamics Inc plans to offer a Research-as-a-Service data processing workflow that will apply IDDQD to dynamic brain PET datasets acquired by the customers, producing accurate quantitative tracer dynamics time-activity curves (TACs) and the distribution of the targeted tissues, including the AD biomarkers beta-amyloid and tau. Our proprietary algorithm does not require the tracer dynamics model to achieve steady state, so a shorter scan can be used to generate results of similar or better accuracy than those produced by current approaches, such as reference tissue- based methods. In this proposal, SolvingDynamics seeks to prove the feasibility of our proposed approach by comparing the diagnostics obtained using IDDQD analysis of dynamic PET data and those obtained from independent measurements. A subcontract group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been conducting dynamic 11C-PIB PET studies for several years and has accumulated over 70 cases with PET data matched to both cognitive-memory tests and to post-mortem pathology studies. SolvingDynamics will retrospectively apply its analysis technique to these datasets and compare its computed tissue distributions to standardized uptake volume ratio (SUVR) and distribution volume ratio (DVR) data. A subset of 20 dynamic 11C-PIB PET datasets ranging in length from 15 to 90 minutes will also be analyzed in order to validate the feasibility of reducing the imaging time. In addition, similar studies aimed at reducing imaging time with IDDQD will be performed for 20 PET scans acquired using 18F-AV1451 tracer to image tau."
"9524622","Project Summary Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is vital if treatments are to be most effective, yet for myriad reasons, a staggering number of older Americans do not receive diagnostic services. Recent technological breakthroughs show considerable promise to identify biomarkers for AD, but nonetheless still require costly and often invasive in-person testing. What is needed is a new approach that can rival current technologies in terms of diagnostic accuracy, while also permitting wider accessibility and economy. The ubiquitous telephone will be the vehicle for this approach in the proposed study. Telephone-based diagnostic screening tests have emerged as a viable alternative to in-person testing, and appear well tolerated and cost-effective. These tests are effective at detecting frank dementia, yet lack sensitivity to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) a likely risk factor for AD. Deficits in language function, particularly semantic knowledge, are characteristic of AD, and these changes may occur decades prior to the emergence of overt symptoms. Research from our group has demonstrated that automated speech analysis can quantify aspects of semantic knowledge in psychiatric samples and can provide similar information to human raters in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Hence, our goal is to determine the acceptability, sensitivity and specificity of an automated speech analysis approach to the detection of AD and MCI from speech samples elicited via telephone. Such an approach has the potential to greatly outperform current screening methods, not only in terms of sensitivity to cognitive decline, but also accessibility, cost, and user satisfaction. If successful, this project could form an integral part of an adaptive, machine learning decision support system to accurately predict an individual's dementia conversion threshold and trajectory of decline."
"9598092","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past 30 years, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the United States has tripled. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been the major underlying reason for this increase. However, only a small fraction of chronic HCV carriers develop HCC. Variation in the risk of HCC among chronic HCV carriers may be caused by complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Several studies indicate a positive association between history of liver cancer in first-degree relatives and risk of HCC development, supporting the potential impact of genetic factors in HCC development. The mechanisms of HCV-induced HCC and genetic susceptibility factors for HCC in chronic HCV carriers are not well studied. Candidate gene-based association studies have implicated a few genetic variants in HCC etiology, but none have been validated as meaningful genetic factors for HCV-associated HCC in the U.S. or for clinical outcomes of HCC. We hypothesize that unique host genetic factors can predict HCC risk in non-viral cases, whereas other markers may predict HCC development in patients with chronic HCV infection and clinical outcome in HCC, including response to therapy. The recent explosion of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has identified numerous genetic susceptibility loci for many cancers. To date, however, no HCC GWAS has been published in the U.S., in part because of difficulty in recruiting large numbers of HCC patients, a result of HCC's natural history and clinical features: 1) HCC is uncommon, especially in the U.S.; 2) HCC is typically diagnosed at a late stage with poor survival; and 3) end- stage chronic liver disease is a major underlying burden in HCC patients. Another barrier to genetic studies of HCC is the lack of comprehensive data on epidemiological and environmental risk factors to control for confounding effects. Only through multi-institutional collaboration can a GWAS of an uncommon cancer such as HCC be performed in the U.S. We propose a GWAS of HCC using 19 North American institutions, which will enable the integration of genetic, environmental, and clinical data. A total of 1715 HCC cases and 3254 controls will be included in the discovery phase, and results will be validated in 2410 cases and 4420 controls. All cases will be frequency-matched to control subjects by age, race and sex. The impact of the validated genotypes on the incidence of HCC development will be assessed in 1100 patients with cirrhosis and who are under surveillance for the development of HCC and enrolled in an NCI-funded follow-up study. In addition to risk assessment, the effect of genetic variation on overall survival of HCC patients will be determined in all cases including an exploratory analysis of progression free survival in HCC patients who have been treated with sorafenib, the current standard of care for advanced HCC. Finally, we plan to explore our objective in Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians for future minority-specific genetic studies in U.S. Our GWAS will provide a detailed understanding of the genetic risk factors for HCC development and prognosis in the U.S."
"9458089","PROJECT SUMMARY Caspase-2 (Casp2) has been described in the literature as an excellent target for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been implicated as therapeutically relevant in Huntington's disease (HD). Several non-apoptotic roles of Casp2 that may be relevant to neurotherapeutic discovery include its regulation of autophagy, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and its effect on dendritic spines. Our own collaborative work provides evidence that ?tau314 (a non-fibillar, N-terminal tau fragment) levels are correlated with AD in humans. In rTg4510 mice, which express the hP301L tau associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), we have shown that Casp2 cleaves tau to form ?tau314 (H2N?YKPVD314), a heretofore-unreported tau fragment, and have linked this soluble tau fragment to reversible cognitive dysfunction. Given these exciting and promising results, we have initiated a comprehensive program to identify potent and selective Casp2 inhibitors. This platform includes standard structure-based design of covalent inhibitors based on the YKPVD314 cleavage site in tau and high-throughput screening (HTS). Herein we propose to employ fragment-based screening (FBS) to expand and complement the scope of this program, increasing the likelihood we will discover small-molecule inhibitors of Casp2. The single specific aim of this exploratory project is to identify and characterize fragments (low molecular weight and soluble compounds) that bind to Casp2. A commercial in-house fragment library will be screened against Casp2 using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). Active ligands will be characterized by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and X-ray crystallography. Confirmed actives will be validated using SAR (structure-activity relationship) by commerce. Our working hypothesis is that the collection of well- characterized scaffolds we discover will constitute excellent starting points for future work focusing on the optimization and development of potent and selective small-molecule inhibitors of Casp2. The potential impact of this project on human health is considerable. There is an unmet medical need for therapeutic agents that can halt or reverse the cognitive decline associated with AD. This work will have a positive impact on the field of therapeutics to treat the cognitive decline observed in several diseases of the central nervous system, particularly AD, HD, and FTD. The eventual development of a selective inhibitor of Casp2 would address this unmet medical need and would represent a significant advancement in the field of AD."
"9458658","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although in recent years there has been an urgent appeal for earlier identification of people at risk for cognitive decline and dementia, middle age and the transition from middle- to early-old-age are still relatively under- studied and not well understood. Yet this critical transition period needs to be the focus of study in order to gain insights into what foreshadows good or poor outcomes. Our primary goal is a better understanding of the genetic and environmental underpinnings of cognitive and brain aging during this period with an eye toward continued follow-up into later old age. To accomplish that goal it is advantageous to prospectively follow a large, genetically-informative sample beginning in a narrow midlife age band. We began the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA) when participants were average age 55 (51-60) and we conducted a follow-up at average age 61. The proposed study is a third wave of multi-modal neuroimaging at average age 66. We will address genetic, and environmental factors that influence change. Aim 1 is to extend the VETSA MRI database-one the largest MRI studies beginning in middle age-to include the third timepoint along with all VETSA cognitive, biomedical, and psychosocial data, and make it publicly available after study completion. We anticipate an ~80% return rate. Aim 2 is to prospectively characterize the heterogeneity of midlife to early- old-age cognitive and brain aging trajectories. Wide age range studies characterize ages 50-60 as a point of inflection when the slope of brain tissue shrinkage or ventricular enlargement increases, but they can only capture average trends. We hypothesize considerable variation in timing of inflection points and in rates of change across brain regions. Some key factors that we will examine are cognitive reserve, early identification of MCI, and interactive effects of APOE genotype. With new longitudinal trajectory data, we will also compare our different operational definitions of MCI when subjects were only in their 50s, to determine those most predictive of stability of MCI or decline. Aim 3 is to examine influences of biomedical, psychosocial, and personality factors on brain and cognitive aging. Some key foci are cardiometabolic factors and responses to stress. We will now have genome-wide genotyping data (at no cost to this project). As such, all of our twin models will now incorporate polygenic risk/propensity scores (PRSs) validated in large external genome-wide association studies, so that we can determine total genetic variance based on measured genetic variance plus remaining latent genetic variance. We will also use novel gene enrichment and genetic-pleiotropy- informed methods developed by members of our team in order to boost the power of those PRSs. This longitudinal, community-based MRI twin study with 3 time points will generate an unprecedented wealth of information during this important aging period that will be a resource for future investigations. The study results can have profound public health impact as early identification improves prospects for intervention that could substantially reduce the number of dementia cases and improve later functioning and quality of life."
"9418510","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our purpose is to evaluate the longer-term impact of Green Dot across the Bluegrass, an active bystanding-based randomized intervention trial in 26 high schools across Kentucky designed to reduce dating and sexual violence in a cohort of seniors as they transition into young adulthood. Our central question is: Does Green Dot continues to have an effect in changing the culture of violence acceptance and reducing violence perpetration among students exposed to Green Dot relative to those not exposed as this cohort enters young adulthood? In this prospective cohort of approximately 7,500 students, we will measure the individual level exposure to the Green Dot program and into young adulthood allowing us to estimate the risk of dating and sexual violence victimization and perpetration. Very few studies have prospectively estimated the risk of dating and sexual violence among a cohort randomized to a primary prevention intervention and followed into young adulthood. This R01 is also unique because cohort members will be followed independent of whether they do or do not attend college. Individually following this cohort of seniors represents a significant value-added and time-sensitive opportunity because the full implementation of Green Dot began in late 2011. Only now (2013-15) would we anticipate seeing an effect of Green Dot among rising seniors on changing bystanding and potentially reducing violence. Aim 1. Prospectively determine whether and how the Green Dot intervention reduces rates of teen dating and sexual violence into young adulthood by (a) changing social norms of violence acceptance, (b) increasing active bystanding, and (c) diffusing the intervention through peer networks. Approximately 7500 high school seniors who attended Kentucky high schools randomized to the Green Dot intervention (n~3750) or control schools (n~3750) will be followed 42 months into young adulthood. Aim 2. To determine the potentially modifying effects of participants' post-high school life experience on the association between exposure to the Green Dot intervention and bystanding actions, teen dating and sexual violence incidence. Post-high school experience will be categorized as attending any form of college or university versus no additional education. Specific life stressors such as relationship status, pregnancy, military deployment, family and peer violence, and substance abuse will also be explored. This cohort study is appropriately powered (?90%) to address both aims. Comparisons will be made at 6-month intervals and across the 42-month follow-up and the interaction of intervention by time will be evaluated. Generalized Estimating Equations will be used to test the impact of Green Dot over time while taking clustering of high schools and correlation among repeated measurements among individual students into account and adjusting for confounders. This prospective cohort builds upon a large population-based and promising primary prevention intervention, designed to reduce dating and sexual violence among high school students and provides an important test of the longer-term efficacy of this program into young adulthood."
"9485195","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with claudication experience significant disability and are faced with limited therapeutic options that include only two FDA approved medications Pentoxifylline and Cilostazol which have at best modest effects. A recent clinical trial identified Ramipril as a promising therapeutic agent that produced improvements in walking distances several times those of Pentoxifylline and Cilostazol and similar to those produced by supervised exercise therapy and operative revascularization. The mechanism(s) by which Ramipril produced these effects is unknown. On the basis of our work on the histopathology of lower leg muscle of claudicating patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and its relationship to leg function, we have designed the present study aimed at determining how Ramipril produces its beneficial effects in claudicating patients. Our HYPOTHESIS is that Treatment of claudicating PAD patients with Ramipril improves walking performance and quality of life by improving the myopathy of the gastrocnemius. Improved myopathy is a consequence of reduced oxidative damage, reduced TGF-ß1 production by vascular smooth muscle cells and reduced collagen deposition in the affected gastrocnemius. We will test our hypothesis by implementing the following Specific Aims. SPECIFIC AIM #1 will Test the hypothesis that Ramipril-mediated improvements of walking parameters among patients with PAD correlate with improvements in both the morphometrics and biochemistry of myofibers in the gastrocnemius of the impaired limb. SPECIFIC AIM #2 will Test the hypothesis that Ramipril-mediated improvements of walking parameters in patients with PAD, correlate with reduced fibrotic events in small vessels and microvasculature, in association with reduced generalized collagen deposition and improved tissue oxygenation, in the gastrocnemius of the impaired limb. We view vascular smooth muscle cells as the principle mediators of fibrosis in PAD muscle. In SPECIFIC AIM #3 we will use adult human arterial smooth muscle cells (AHASMC), in vitro, to test the hypothesis that the ACE inhibitor Ramipril, which acts as an antagonist of Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (ART1) stimulation by reducing tissue Angiotensin II (Ang II), impedes a mechanism in which Ang II stimulation of ART1 and exposure to hypoxia enhance proliferation of AHASMC and their production of TGF-ß1 and collagen, via stimulation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase signaling and suppression of phosphatase and tensin homologue, a master regulator of cell growth. If our hypothesis is correct, then the work in Aims #1 and #2 will demonstrate for the first time that therapy with Ramipril improves limb function and quality of life by improving the myopathy of skeletal muscles in the ischemic lower limbs. The work in Aim #3 will identify pathways by which hypoxia and Ang II collaborate to induce myopathy in ischemic muscle. Specific agents targeting these pathways could become new treatments for claudication and for more advanced stages of PAD. Finally, information from this study may identify new tools for precise staging of PAD, evaluating therapeutic interventions and identifying patients who will benefit from aggressive therapy."

Quality of sleep is important for quality of life ad there is evidence for poorer sleep quality in older persons and in persons at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Actigraphy is a low-cost noninvasive method of measuring activity validated for assessing sleep quality, using an accelerometer that is worn like a wristwatch. We propose to add actigraphic assessment of sleep quality in 50 amyloid-positive and 50 amyloid-negative participants who have consented to A4. We hope to assess the effect of anti-amyloid therapy on sleep quality, and the effect of baseline amyloid status on changes in sleep in the placebo and amyloid-negative group."
"9557778","Project Summary/Abstract Quality parks provide numerous benefits to individuals and communities, including health cost-savings through physical activity and stress relief, increased tax revenue via augmented property values and attracting businesses, and positive social and environmental impacts through outcomes such as civic pride and pollution control. The Community Park Audit Tool (CPAT) provides a comprehensive yet user-friendly means of engaging diverse stakeholders in the process of evaluating and improving local parks to achieve these benefits. More recently, we developed an initial electronic app version of the CPAT (eCPAT) and have conducted extensive beta testing with project and workshop participants (e.g., youth, public health researchers, park professionals). eCPAT has been very well-received throughout these preliminary efforts, but they have also identified important improvements to the app and associated infrastructure that are needed to satisfy the demands of a multitude of interested user groups and support commercialization. Therefore, the two related aims of this proposal are: 1) To develop and advance eCPAT mobile technology and infrastructure for broader use by diverse populations, and 2) To conduct feasibility testing and examine the utility of the eCPAT system with diverse user groups. To accomplish these aims, we will build on our team's vast expertise in parks and recreation, technology development, public health, and entrepreneurship to integrate additional innovative features within the eCPAT app (e.g., camera, GIS, social media connectivity) as well as develop robust access and database infrastructure to ensure scalability and security. We will then engage 100 stakeholders from a variety of fields (public parks and recreation agencies, parks and public health researchers, citizens, health care professionals, real estate investors/agents) in workshops to test the enhanced eCPAT app and system and to examine strategies for commercialization and dissemination. Advancement of eCPAT represents an innovative opportunity ? in a substantial market with no current competitors ? to capitalize on the benefits of electronic data collection and to facilitate the integration of these data with other emerging technologies to support individual, organizational, and community decision-making. The eCPAT app and system can be used by parks and recreation agencies in communities across the U.S. to standardize park data collection and management; by researchers conducting studies about the built environment, parks, and related outcomes such as physical activity and obesity; by citizens conducting grassroots advocacy and desiring to communicate park information to officials and fellow residents; by health care professionals participating in rapidly-growing park prescriptions initiatives that recommend parks as destinations for health promotion; and by real estate agents and investors working to showcase the park resources in a neighborhood. These and other user groups illustrate eCPAT's significant commercial potential and capacity for improving the value of public parks to community engagement, economic prosperity, and health."

"9459315","The immediate goal of this application is to understand how osteoclast (OC) differentiation is regulated through negative endogenous regulators, which may provide novel therapeutic targets for bone diseases, such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although positive regulators of OC differentiation through the receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (RANK) ligand (RANKL)-RANK signaling axis have been extensively studied, understanding of negative regulators of OC differentiation is elusive. To identify key negative regulators of OC differentiation, we utilized microarray, gene downregulation, and osteoclastogenesis assays, leading to the isolation of guanine protein alpha subunit 13 (G?13, encoded by the Gna13 gene) as a potential OC negative regulator. To enable in vivo investigation of the role of G?13 in OC differentiation, we generated an OC-lineage specific Gna13 conditional knockout (CKO) mouse model by crossing Gna13f/f mice with LysM-Cre (OC precursor specific) mice. Our preliminary data showed that Gna13f/fLysM-Cre mice exhibited a severe osteoporosis from a drastic increase in OC differentiation. We also noted that G?13 deficiency attenuates RhoA activity and promotes Akt activity in OCs. Consistently, we showed that, as a proof of principle strategy, local constitutively active G?13 overexpression can protect against bone and cartilage loss while also attenuating inflammation in a mouse model of RA. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that G?13 is a key negative regulator of OC that controls OC cell lineage commitment and differentiation for bone homeostasis under physiological and pathological conditions through activating RhoA and attenuating AKT signaling pathway. Three specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will characterize the bone phenotypes of Gn?13f/fLysM-Cre mice and elucidate the mechanism underlying how G?13 activates RhoA signaling and attenuates Akt signaling to negatively regulate OC cell lineage commitment and differentiation. In Aim 2 we will determine the upstream G?13 signaling cascade in OCs through characterization of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) coupled with G?13. We will characterize the mechanism underlying the roles of G?13 in bone remodeling and pathological bone loss by using dendritic cell (DC)-, monocyte- and OC-specific Gna13 CKO and overexpression transgenic mice in the loss-of-function and gain-of-function analysis, respectively. This study may provide important insights into the roles of negative regulators of OC differentiation in bone homeostasis and osteolytic bone diseases of excessive OC differentiation. Knowledge gained from this study may generate potential therapeutic targets, through characterization of G?13 signaling in OCs that may be targeted in treating osteolytic bone diseases by mimicking normal OC inhibitory signaling pathway to control OC formation. A multidisciplinary research team, including a bone biologist with expertise in OC biology and animal models of bone diseases; a bone biologist with expertise in OC biology and cell signaling; and an immunologist with expertise in autoimmunity diseases including RA has been established to achieve the research goal."
"9520144","Project Summary/Abstract Triclosan (TCS) is a synthetic antimicrobial agent that has been widely used in the U.S. and globally for more than 40 years. First invented in the early 1970s to be employed as an antiseptic and disinfectant in healthcare environments, TCS now comes into direct contact with humans in household settings through a large number of consumer products ranging from personal care products to food packaging materials. Consequently, its rising environmental release causes serious contamination in the environment, and it is now known as an Emerging Contaminant (EC) - a detectable but currently unregulated and frequently untreated environmental contaminant. While there have been numerous health concerns associated with TCS, our recent findings provide compelling evidence that long-term TCS exposure promotes liver carcinogenesis in mice. Using a carcinogen-induced animal model, we demonstrate that TCS causes toxicant-associated steatohepatitis (TASH) manifested by hepatic steatosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and liver fibrosis, resulting in enhanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Similar to TCS, obesity and metabolic syndrome are also major etiologic factors causing steatohepatitis, termed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The rising prevalence of TASH and NASH ? mirroring the increase in environmental toxicant exposure and obesity ? is tightly linked to a growing epidemic of advanced liver disease. Recent animal studies have revealed that the disrupted gut microbiota (dysbiosis) plays a causative role in the pathogenesis of TASH and NASH, and patients with several types of chronic liver diseases show impairment of the gut microflora and intestinal barrier, highlighting a primary etiologic role of intestinal dysbiosis in liver disease. To explore the pathogenic mechanism underlying TCS-induced TASH, we hypothesize that ?persistent TCS exposure causes a structurally disrupted intestinal microbiota that is a driving force of TASH development, and chronic overnutrition by a high-fat diet (HFD) is synergistic with TCS-induced TASH, leading to end-stage liver disease and HCC.? We propose to examine the following aims: 1) We will identify the gut microbiota composition following long-term TCS exposure using 16S rRNA sequencing and metatranscriptomics. We will also employ germ-free (GF) and humanized NASH mice to determine the role of gut flora in TCS-induced liver disease. 2) We will investigate regulatory roles of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in intestinal permeability and tight junctions responding to TCS treatment. We have rationalized that, reacting to TCS toxic insult, gut microbes releasing bacterial products and metabolites activate TLR signaling and initiate innate immune responses, stimulating profibrogenic and proinflammatory events in the liver. These experiments will use Myd88 liver conditional knockout mice to compare TCS and CCl4-induced liver toxicity. 3) We will evaluate whether TCS combined with a HFD confers greater susceptibility to the progression of TASH into tumorigenesis by using a diabetes animal model that displays signs of NASH following a HFD feeding. We postulate that autophagy status and IL-17A signaling underlines enhanced induction of HCC by TCS together with HFD."
"9488040","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our goal is to understand how thoracic multi detector-row computed tomography (MDCT) combined with innovative image analysis techniques can be used to identify COPD patients at greatest risk. The overall objective of this proposal is to focus on the pulmonary vasculature. We hypothesize that novel quantitative MDCT-based metrics that characterize heterogeneity of pulmonary parenchymal perfusion and pulmonary vascular anatomy in early stage COPD subjects will allow us to identify subjects at greater risk for rapid disease progression. Numerous observations from our own laboratories and others point to an abnormal pulmonary vascular response to smoking induced parenchymal inflammation that leads to the development of emphysema. We have established imaging methods for the quantitative assessment of the pulmonary vascular tree and regional pulmonary parenchymal perfusion status. The former measure takes advantage of volumetric MDCT and the later makes use of dual energy MDCT (DE-MDCT) to provide clinically implementable tools for the interrogation of lung structure and function. Our Specific Aims are as follows: (1) determine whether objective, quantitative measures of increased PBV heterogeneity derived from DE-MDCT, as an index of emphysema susceptibility, will serve as a very early indicator of rapid emphysema progression (assessed by MDCT) and lung function decline; (2) determine whether anatomic changes in pulmonary vascular geometry will identify subjects at risk for more rapid emphysema progression and lung function decline, possibly in more urgent need of intervention; and (3) determine whether early anatomic and functional markers of vascular disease will combine to identify subjects at increased risk for development of frequent exacerbations who require more intense therapy before significant lung function decline has occurred. In this time-sensitive proposal, we will leverage the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS). SPIROMICS offers a unique opportunity to study at risk smokers and individuals with COPD in a longitudinal study that are well-characterized in terms of repeated clinical, physiological and biological evaluations. We propose to insert a baseline DE-MDCT scan to evaluate an index of pulmonary perfusion heterogeneity (Perfused Blood Volume: PBV) in 200 GOLD 0/I subjects at baseline and to insert a 3rd year MDCT exam into the SPIROMICS protocol for these same individuals. We also propose a year 3 MDCT exam in an additional 125 GOLD II-III SPIROMICS subjects. Our over-riding goal is to evaluate early functional and anatomic indices of vascular dysfunction to determine the association between these metrics and rate of emphysema progression, lung function decline and risk of AECOPD."
"9523413","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Lung endothelial barrier integrity at the level of adherens junctions (AJs) is required for lung fluid homeostasis. A crucial mechanism contributing to the loss of endothelial barrier integrity in conditions such as pulmonary edema is ?stress failure? of pulmonary capillaries in response to high pressure. While it is known that AJs, comprised of VE-cadherin and associated catenin proteins, restrict endothelial permeability, little is known about how mechanical forces, specifically vessel wall tension, control endothelial permeability and pulmonary edema. Our Supporting Data describe the potentially important role of hydrostatic pressure in microvessels in activating the mechanosensor Piezo1 in endothelial cells (ECs) and in increasing endothelial barrier permeability. We observed that activation of Piezo1 induced intracellular Ca2+ signaling, which in turn, caused phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and increased microvascular permeability. These findings have for the first time linked increased tension to which ECs are exposed to the activation of Piezo1 and disassembly of AJs, leading to the fundamental question ?how does tension sensed at the plasma membrane of ECs by Piezo1 activate VE- cadherin phosphorylation and thereby disrupt AJs?? In Aim 1, we will determine the role of microvessel pressure in activating the mechanosensor channel Piezo1 in lung ECs and Piezo1?s role in regulating endothelial permeability and lung fluid balance. We will determine whether Src dependent phosphorylation of Piezo1 is required for Piezo1 activated Ca2+ signaling in ECs and whether this thereby mediates increased endothelial permeability. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of Piezo1 signaling in mediating disassembly of AJs through phosphorylation of VE-cadherin, and in increasing endothelial permeability. Here, we will identify the signaling pathway downstream of Piezo1 activation that induces phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and VE-cadherin endocytosis and thus disassemble the AJs. In Aim 3, we will determine the role of Piezo1 in mediating lung vascular hyper-permeability (?stress failure?) and edema associated with left heart failure (LHF). These studies will address the pathophysiological relevance of Piezo1 in the mechanism of pulmonary edema resulting from LHF-induced increases in lung microvessel pressure. The above studies will be essential for understanding the role of Piezo1 in increasing lung microvessel permeability, with the goal of identifying new therapeutic targets for high pressure-induced pulmonary edema."
"9456803","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are a group of related neurodevelopmental syndromes defined by social communication deficits and by restricted and repetitive behaviors. The public health burden is enormous, with an estimated cost of $35 billion in the U.S alone. Behavioral approaches are currently the mainstay of treatment; options for somatic therapies remain extremely limited. A new generation of more effective treatments will require a far deeper understanding of the pathobiology of ASD. In addition, while there has been significant recent progress in clarifying the genomic architecture of autism, only a small number of the hundreds of genes and genomic regions thought to be involved in ASD have so far been identified. The current proposal focuses on discovering additional rare recessive mutations leading to autism via the study of consanguineous families from Egypt and Turkey. The project leverages a long-standing collaboration between the Gunel and State labs, which have independently and collectively demonstrated the productivity of homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing for a range of developmental disorders including autism. Our long-term goal is to make use of genetics to identify therapeutic targets in ASD while contributing to translating such findings to clinical practice. Our hypothesis is that th discovery of additional rare recessive, highly penetrant ASD mutations in consanguineous families will advance the understanding of molecular mechanisms; that these will show overlap with the emerging picture of the genetic architecture and biology of idiopathic ASD in outbred populations, and that, combined, these advances will lay the foundation for the development of novel, rational, and more efficacious treatments. Therefore, we focused on 3 specific aims: 1) To expand our current cohort of consanguineous ASD families with an additional 250 carefully diagnosed ASD kindreds from Egypt and Turkey, 2) To identify novel, rare, highly penetrant genetic variants that contribute to ASD by employing homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing in 384 ASD subjects and parents; and 3) To search for clustering of these variants among unrelated families as well as to evaluate the overlap in risk loci for inbred versus outbred ASD populations, cross- referencing findings from these Middle Eastern families with data from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC), which we have been studying for the past 5 years and to evaluate the identified homozygous variants with reference to ASD-associated developmental co-expression networks using high confidence ASD genes discovered in outbred families. Overall this proposal is aimed at advancing the understanding of the genetics and biology of ASD in the interests of identifying novel approaches to diagnosis, and therapeutic development."
"9518307","Project Summary/Abstract Background and preliminary data: Immuno-PET with 89Zr-labeled antibodies is a promising approach for detection, staging, and characterization of malignant tumor. Recently, we have applied this approach to imaging of PDAC using the monoclonal IgG1 antibody HMab-5B1, which potently binds on the cancer antigen (CA) 19-9. Overexpression of CA 19-9 is a well-established feature of PDAC and serum levels of CA 19-9 are commonly used in the clinic for diagnosis, risk stratification, and follow-up of pancreatic cancer. While CA 19-9 enters the circulation, its concentration in the tumor is orders of magnitude higher and leads to accumulation of HuMab-5B1 in the tumor tissue. This has been demonstrated by an ongoing phase I clinical trial at MSK that studies CA 19-9 positive malignancies with 89Zr-DFO-HuMab-5B1 PET/CT. In this trial, 89Zr-DFO-HuMab-5B1 PET/CT has shown not only known metastases, but also many sub-centimeter lesions that were not apparent on routine clinical imaging (CT, MRI). Furthermore, a significant fraction of the patients demonstrated very high and persistant uptake of 89Zr-DFO-HuMab-5B1 in the tumor tissue (SUVmax up to 101 g/ml) and tumor-to- blood ratios were higher than 10 for 50% of the lesions, suggesting that HuMab-5B1 labeled with beta-emitting radioisotopes may deliver therapeutic doses to PDAC. The goal of this application is to validate 89Zr-DFO-HuMab-5B1 PET/CT imaging findings by histopathology in patients with CA 19-9 positive pancreatic cancers scheduled to undergo surgery. Specific aims and approach: We will image 15 patients within one week before surgery and use intraoperative gamma probe measurements to precisely localize these findings in the surgical specimens. The expression of CA 19-9 will be assessed by immunohistochemistry and correlated with the tumor uptake of 89Zr on PET. Patients will undergo a diagnostic CT, optimized for pancreatic cancer imaging as part of the PET/CT study and we will test if the addition of the PET increases the staging accuracy of contrast-enhanced CT. Furthermore, we will perform quantitative autoradiography of the resected specimens in order to quantify the precise concentration of radioactivity in the tumor tissue without interfering partial volume effects. Autoradiography will also allow us to study the intratumoral distribution of 89Zr, which may affect the radiation dose that can be safely administered to the tumor tissue with systematically administered HuMab-5B1 labeled with a therapeutic radioisotope. Impact: If the study confirms our preliminary clinical findings that 89Zr-DFO-HuMab-5B1 PET/CT can detect metastatic PDAC with markedly higher sensitivity than CT alone, this would have a major impact on the selection of patients for surgery and surgical planning. Furthermore, if the degree of uptake of 89Zr-DFO- HuMab-5B1 in PDAC metastases is as high as suggested by our preliminary data, HuMab-5B1 would be a highly attractive theranostic agent for treatment of pancreatic cancer."
"9040941","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  NSAIDS and the Role of COX2 in Biologic Scaffold-Mediated Tissue Reconstruction  Extracellular matrix based biologic scaffolds are utilized extensively to improve the host response to injury by shifting the response away from an inflammatory, fibrotic response and towards a regenerative response. A wide variety of biologic scaffolds are used clinically for the repair and reinforcement of numerous tissues and organs. Despite a large cohort of clinical data showing beneficial results, occasionally these biologic scaffold materials fail to induce or only partially induce a beneficial remodeling response. Minimizing this variability requires an intimate knowledge of the molecular and cellular processes that biologic scaffolds initiate during the remodeling process. Unfortunately, to date, the mechanism(s) by which biologic scaffolds promote constructive remodeling are not completely understood. However, modulation of the host innate immune response - and more specifically, macrophages - toward a regulatory and constructive phenotype has been shown to be critically important. Macrophages have been shown to occupy a wide array of interchangeable phenotypes spanning the classic pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1) at one extreme to the regulatory, anti- inflammatory phenotype (M2) at the other. Numerous reports have indicated that biologic scaffolds promote an M2 macrophage phenotype during the tissue remodeling cascade. Strikingly, both the development of an M2 phenotype and the remodeling of injured skeletal muscle are strongly influenced by the soluble factors that are synthesized by Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). Given that Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are well-characterized, potent inhibitors of COX1 and 2, it is plausible that prescription of NSAIDs after biologic scaffold implantation could alter the endogenous constructive tissue remodeling process.  The central theme of this proposal is that COX2 up regulation is a critical component of the biologic scaffold initiated tissue remodeling program and administration of NSAIDs may alter the overall tissue remodeling outcome. Aim 1 seeks to establish a firm mechanistic link between biologic scaffold stimulated COX2 up regulation in macrophages and its effect on myogenesis using a well-established in vitro system. This system will then be utilized to determine the effect(s) of NSAIDs on both the macrophage phenotype and the myogenic response. Aim 2 furthers these studies by investigating macrophage phenotype, myogenesis, and COX2 expression in a well-established muscle injury model. This model will then be utilized with NSAID treatments to determine the effect of NSAIDs on the remodeling outcome. The completion of these studies will greatly enhance our understanding of the molecular events that biologic scaffolds trigger to initiate a constructive tissue remodeling response, and if NSAIDs alter those events and the remodeling outcome. Together these studies may provide a new metric for the design of next generation biologic scaffolds as well as provide useful information to physicians utilizing regenerative medicine technologies who may be prescribing NSAIDs for post-operative care."
"9493123","Project Summary Here we request funds to purchase an upright Nikon A1R-MP multiphoton microscopy system with a high-resolution galvanometer-based scanner, a high-speed resonant scanner, a femtosecond infrared pulse laser (700-1080 nm), three GaAsP detectors, and a high sensitivity extended red response PMT. The instrument will be housed within the UW-Madison Optical Imaging Core (UWOIC) facility at the University of Wisconsin- Madison. The goal of this facility is to provide access to a range of optical imaging modalities to all research groups on campus, with an emphasis on high speed, high- resolution microscopy. Importantly, we have outfitted our facility with a full tissue culture suite, with space for animal housing available on a nearby floor, to enable users from anywhere on campus to use instruments here. The multiphoton system will be the first of its kind in any imaging core facility on the UW-Madison campus and will fill a critical void in available technologies to UW investigators. It will immediately serve more than twenty NIH funded research laboratories, with expertise in metabolism, neuroscience, regenerative medicine, oncology, biomaterials, and immunology. As the user base of the core facility continues to grow (more than 150 individuals conduct work here), we have observed a dramatically increased demand for deep tissue imaging, which cannot be satisfied by the single photon confocal systems currently available on campus. In response, we have partnered with the UW-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, the UW Carbone Cancer Center, and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education and identified matching financial support for this application to purchase a state-of-the-art multiphoton microscopy system. Committed long-term funds will also fully support a full time core manager and an extended service contract for the Nikon A1R-MP system. We anticipate that the addition of this multiphoton microscope will not only greatly strengthen current NIH-funded projects, but will also allow our users to explore new questions not previously tenable in the absence of a platform to image deep into samples with high speed. Therefore, this instrument will play a critical role in promoting new discoveries in basic and clinically relevant sciences and will support cutting edge projects into the foreseeable future."
"9472886","PROJECT SUMMARY Challenges exist in recruiting and retaining minorities in research on Alzheimer?s disease (AD), thereby limiting the ability to elucidate mechanisms for health disparities in AD risk and to adequately measure treatment efficacy in underserved populations. African Americans represent an especially important group to target for research due to their two-fold risk of AD compared to non-Hispanic Caucasians. Advances in technology to evaluate cognitive functioning, particularly the use of mobile applications such as smartphones, offer the promise for overcoming barriers that may limit African American research participation including scheduling difficulties, associated study costs, and examinee/examiner cultural mismatches. Remotely administered neuropsychological measures can be performed at an individual?s convenience, and outcomes can be collected at multiple time points. In the proposed R03 study, we will leverage the resources and volunteers who have signed up for a new community initiative at our institution, the Emory Healthy Aging Study, involving remote engagement of individuals through smartphone technology. The Co-PIs have selected tasks from the cognitive neuroscience literature that are non-proprietary and have strong behavioral and neuroimaging correlates in APOE-?4 carriers, amnestic mild cognitive impairment and AD patients, and healthy aging groups. The proposed grant will pilot these measures when administered via smartphones to middle-aged and older African Americans and Caucasians, with the overall goal of determining whether group differences exist that could have diagnostic relevance in future studies. Sixty African American and 60 non-Hispanic Caucasian adults 45-75 years of age will complete the traditional versions and the smartphone adaptations of the cognitive measures in the clinic setting and will then complete the smartphone applications remotely at 3 and 6 months post-baseline assessment. Specific Aims are to 1) Establish reliability of the smartphone applications (both internal consistency and in comparison to the traditional version (inter-modality reliability)) 2) Establish test- retest reliability of the smartphone measures; and 3) Assess adherence rates of the remotely administered smartphone measures. A secondary Aim is to examine factors (i.e., quality of education, socioeconomic status, and vascular comorbidities) that we expect to be correlated with performance on cognitive measures administered via smartphones and that are underlying factors often associated with cognitive performance differences between African Americans and Caucasians. The long-term goal of a future study is to validate these mobile cognitive measures against neuroimaging, genetic, and CSF biomarkers of central amyloidosis."
"9506821","Project Summary It is well known that structures in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), including the hippocampus, are necessary for the formation, consolidation and retrieval of new episodic memories. Perhaps the most common neuroscientific approach to understanding the brain systems supporting episodic memory is to examine encoding and retrieval of information presented on single trials. While this approach has yielded significant insights, it overlooks the fact that new experiences often are meaningfully related to prior experiences, and as such, are integrated with existing knowledge so that we may retain and update our internal models of the world. This observation raises the important questions of how we (1) store the details of individual events that are part of a greater whole, (2) extract the structural commonalities across multiple related events that occur over gaps in time, and (3) how knowledge structures new learning. To date, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying these critical aspects of episodic memory. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms that support the development, representation and use of prior knowledge to bolster new episodic learning. The objectives of the current proposal are (1) to test a model of how prior knowledge in the form of prediction about the structure of experience can increase memory encoding by recruiting processes supported by ventromedial PFC during new learning and (2) to test hypotheses about feature-based integration that leads memories with similar features and contexts to evolve to have overlapping cortical representations through consolidation mechanisms. The central aim of the project is to establish the role of vmPFC and other cortical regions in communication with the hippocampus in mediating the benefits of new learning with prior knowledge. The rationale for the proposed research is that a better understanding of how the memories become stabilized and integrated over time will lead to better cognitive therapies to remediate memory loss. Under Aim 1, a variety of measures/techniques ? including behavior, fMRI, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electrocorticography (ECoG) ? will be used to examine how prior knowledge about the expected structure of an unfolding event influences the neural mechanisms underlying the temporal encoding of event details. Aim 1's experiments will build on this foundational research by modulating the predictability of the sequential structure of a current event to understand how prior knowledge modulates behavior and neural processes associated with event memory. Aim 2 will explore the initial learning of structured knowledge about related events, which involves the integration of related information across distinct episodes. The proposed experiments will extend this work to examine how the representation of commonalities across experiences can emerge with time via memory consolidation."

"9465546","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mammalian brain have been demonstrated to play important roles in the plasticity of higher brain function and repair and regeneration after brain damage. Yet, our understanding of the regulation of adult NSCs at the molecular level remains sketchy, and this is one of the reasons for why strategies to harness the capacity of endogenous NSCs for brain repair have not yet made sufficient progress for clinical applications. The goal of this study is to fill in this current knowledge gap by identifying crucial regulatory mechanisms in adult NSCs using mouse as a model system. In particular, our recent studies have shown that the homeodomain transcription factor (TF) Gsx2 and basic helix-loop-helix TF Ascl1, which have been well known for their essential roles in embryonic brain development, play vital roles in controlling NSCs in the adult subventricular zone (SVZ). Importantly, we found that Gsx2 and Ascl1 control adult-specific regulatory steps in NSCs. We also have shown that these TFs play essential roles in injury-induced neurogenesis. Our preliminary studies further suggest that unlike in embryos in which Gsx2 and Ascl1 act in a linear cascade (Gsx2 ¿ Ascl1 ¿ neurogenesis), their cross-inhibition plays a key role in controlling the fate of adult NSCs. Based on these novel findings and in vivo tools, we will test the hypothesis that Gsx2 and Ascl1, as well as their downstream effectors, play crucial roles in controlling NSCs in adult-specific manners under intact and injury conditions in the following three specific aims: Aim 1 will reveal novel mechanisms for lineage progression of adult NSCs through studies on Gsx2, Ascl1, and their downstream targets. ; Aim 2 will reveal novel mechanisms for regional specification of NSCs and neuronal subtype specification of olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons through studies on the regulation of Gsx2 and its downstream factors.; Aim 3 will reveal novel mechanisms for injury-induced neurogenesis through studies on the regulation of the expression and action of Gsx2."
"9688440","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks support for the UMass Worcester Prevention Research Center (UMW-PRC), initially funded by the CDC in 2009 as a developmental PRC. Funding will support the growth and enhancement of a comprehensive core infrastructure that fosters applied public health research partnerships with state and local departments of public health and numerous community partners. Our faculty conduct intervention research, implementation research and public health practice-based research that targets the CDC Winnable Battles of nutrition, physical activity and obesity in the Worcester, MA area. The UMW-PRC has six priority areas: racial and ethnic health disparities, the built environment and systems, comorbid obesity and mental health, child and adolescent health, worksite health promotion, and community-clinical linkages. In the proposed funding cycle, the UMW-PRC will further its role as 1) an institutional leader in applied public health research, 2) an integral part of the collaborative public health system within Worcester, MA, 3) a statewide resource for applied public health research expertise, and 4) a national model for bidirectional applied public health research that integrates academic medicine, public health, health care and communities. This will be accomplished through innovations in each of the PRC programmatic components: administration and infrastructure, community engagement and technical assistance, communication and dissemination, training, and evaluation. Building from this infrastructure, our proposed applied public health prevention research project will be implemented in the racial/ethnically diverse Union Hill neighborhood, which the City of Worcester has prioritized for revitalization due to its high rates of crime, poverty and unemployment, deteriorating built environment, and high chronic disease burden. Targeted resource investments aim to improve crime and safety and economic development. Simultaneously, Union Hill will be targeted by a Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) Mass in Motion/Community Transformation Grant (MiM- CTG) to implement public policy and environmental improvements to promote physical activity and healthy eating and reduce obesity. Perceived social norms, limited parental efficacy to influence child obesogenic behaviors and limited parenting skills related to child obesogenic behaviors may reduce the impact of built environment interventions. The proposed study will test the impact of the built environment intervention plus a family-focused community health worker (CHW)-delivered component to improve ability of families to navigate their environment and promote healthy eating and activity through improvements in social norms, parental efficacy, and parenting skills, compared to the built environment intervention plus an attention control CHW- delivered component. The study uses a quasi-experimental design to assess impact on child and parent diet, physical activity and BMI. We will use MDPH statewide child BMI data to compare impact of the combined built environment interventions in Union Hill to the MiM-CTG program only in comparable MA urban communities."

"9418563","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key policy question for the coming decade is how best to structure incentives and regulations to insure that frail older hospitalized patients receie cost effective and coordinated care. Both federal and state policy has transformed long-term care with the emergence of post-acute care provided by nursing homes (NH) and other providers. Post-acute care now represents approximately 20% of all Medicare spending. Our first Program Project grant focused on the effect of states' Medicaid policies on the strategic choices that NHs make and how those choices impact patient outcomes. We find that not only do states' policies influence providers' investments which can positively or adversely affect residents' outcome, we've also found that Medicare policies affected Medicaid providers and states' Medicaid policies affected Medicare patients, often in a dysfunctional manner. Indeed, Medicare policy changes directed at acute hospitals trickle down to impact most NHs further highlighting the interconnectedness of long term and post-acute care policy domains. Thus, Medicaid and Medicare policies are intertwined; when Medicare policies change, even if only directed at hospitals, NHs and other PAC providers are affected. Since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) represents the biggest policy change to Medicare and Medicaid in decades, we believe it is imperative to understand its effects on the acute care and post-acute care interface. The three projects and cores we propose all focus on the growing role of post-acute care (PAC); each has historical aims as well as aims that examine the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Project #1 asks whether hospitals with strong relationships with NH partners have lower re-hospitalization rates. Project #2 examines the impact of hospitals' approaches to staffing the attending physician role on frail, hospitalized NH residents experience. Finally, Project #3 examines, for the first time, the use of PAC by Medicare managed care and how patients respond to changing co-pay structures for PAC."
"9463365","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop new strategies for addressing the persistent gender gap in science achievement by targeting the mechanisms by which maladaptive beliefs that interfere with achievement arise. The persistent underrepresentation of women in science limits women's cognitive and economic attainment and-due to the growing number of households relying on the sole income of a female earner-contributes to child poverty and its concomitant negative effects on child physical, emotional, and cognitive development. Increasing the representation of women in science is a crucial way to help girls and women optimize their opportunities for cognitive development, and will also help to close the gender-linked earning gap, decrease rates of child poverty, and improve child health. Maladaptive beliefs-that scientists are a distinct kind of person, that being a scientist requires innate talent, and that scientists are deeply different from non-scientists-reflect an essentialist conception of science that interferes with female students' achievement. This project aims to discover: (a) what experiences cause girls to develop these beliefs, (b) what is responsible for girls having those experiences in the first place, and (c) how to intervene to stop the processes by which these maladaptive beliefs arise. This projects tests the hypothesis that these maladaptive beliefs are transmitted via pervasive but subtle linguistic cues-for example, by asking children to be scientists instead of to do science. These linguistic cues implicitly describe success in science as involving membership in a particular category, thus eliciting maladaptive essentialist beliefs. The planned studies test (a) whether hearing these linguistic cues causes girls to develop maladaptive, essentialist beliefs about science, (b) whether adults' own beliefs cause them to produce these linguistic cues, and (c) whether targeting adults' beliefs and language can help children develop more adaptive beliefs and increase girls' engagement in science. By partnering with a major cultural institution that provides informal educational opportunities to children and by involving educators directly in this work, this projec maximizes the opportunities for this research to lead to rapid changes in educational practices that will benefit children."
"9469471","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) represent a group of systemic autoimmune disorders in which muscle and extra-muscular organs are targeted for immune-mediated destruction. We have previously established a model of histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HRS)-induced myositis that involves MyD88-dependent innate immune signaling pathways featuring Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2, TLR4). Given the prominent role of these TLRs in our model of HRS-induced myositis, we hypothesize that heightened activation of the downstream transcription regulator NF-?B is ultimately responsible for various inflammatory cascades as well as non-immune pathways promoting muscle dysfunction in this system?effectively linking HRS-induced myositis/IIM with other disorders (including muscular dystrophy as well as sepsis- and trauma/ischemia- induced myopathies) in which NF-?B dysregulation contributes to muscle inflammation, muscle degeneration, and impaired regenerative potential. Through a series of in vitro culture systems and in vivo immunization strategies involving knockout mice lacking critical components of MyD88-dependent signaling pathways, we will systematically examine the impact of HRS-induced TLR signaling and NF-?B activation on T cell migration, T cell activation, and muscle weakness. While Specific Aim 1 will focus on HRS-induced changes in T cell function and TLR-mediated activation of vascular endothelium (leading to lymphocytic infiltration of target organs), Specific Aim 2 will define direct and indirect pathways of HRS-induced NF-?B activation in muscle tissue through in vitro myoblast stimulation assays as well as additional immunization studies focusing on correlations between muscle inflammation, NF-?B activation, and in vivo/ex vivo parameters of muscle weakness. Complementary in vivo assessment tools including MRI and the use of NF-?B-luciferase transgenic mice will further define the relationship between HRS-mediated NF-?B activation and muscle dysfunction, providing the foundation for experimental trials of comparative NF-?B inhibition in Specific Aim 3. Collectively, these studies will elucidate the contribution of innate immunity to the pathogenesis of IIM, supplementing more traditional paradigms of antigen-specific, adaptive immune recognition and identifying therapeutic targets that are potentially relevant to a range of human inflammatory muscle diseases."
"9454539","Ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is a consequence of adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). As a result of a lack of conclusive data regarding the best surgical approach (valve repair vs. replacement) the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) conducted two multicenter, randomized trials to evaluate the relative benefits of these two surgical approaches to IMR. Unfortunately, the CTSN IMR trials did not establish the optimal surgical approach. Results of the CTSN Severe IMR trial demonstrated no difference in LV reverse remodeling between repair and replacement groups. However, subgroup analysis highlighted the negative implications of recurrent IMR. IMR recurred much more frequently in the repair group, resulting in more heart-failure related adverse events. Importantly, repair patients with recurrent IMR had no reduction in LV volume, while repair patients without recurrence experienced LV volume reduction that was superior to patients having valve replacement. These results strongly suggest that a patient- specific approach to surgical treatment guided by preoperative imaging-based risk stratification that is predictive of recurrent IMR would be useful for optimizing surgical results. During the initial funding period of this project, our group at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) demonstrated that measures of mitral leaflet tethering derived from pre-operative 3D echocardiography (3DE) and a custom valve modeling algorithm accurately predicted the recurrence of IMR after valve repair. The goal of this competitive renewal is to provide conclusive evidence that pre- operative risk-based repair/replacement stratification using 3DE significantly reduces recurrent IMR and, more importantly, improves LV remodeling, long-term clinical outcomes and survival for patients with IMR. We propose to use two existing data sets to achieve our intended goal expeditiously and at limited expense: (1) as part of the initially funded project we have recruited 85 patients with IMR that have had pre-repair 3DE and have been followed prospectively to assess for recurrence of IMR. We propose to continue this recruitment at Penn to enlarge our cohort to 120 patients to allow further development and validation of an optimal predictive algorithm for recurrent IMR after MV repair; (2) the CTSN IMR trials data base which includes 551 IMR patients randomized to either MV repair (n=276), MV replacement (n=125) or CABG alone (n=150); 180 of the CTSN cohort have had pre-operative 3DE. All CTSN patients also have extensive echocardiographic and long-term clinical follow-up, which is ongoing. In Aim 1 we will establish the optimal 3DE-based predictive algorithm for recurrent IMR from candidate algorithms developed from continued recruitment of IMR repair patients at Penn. In Aim 2 we will assess the benefit of using the ideal predictive algorithm from Aim 1 on the incidence of recurrent IMR and long-term clinical outcomes in the CTSN IMR Trials data base. Finally, in Aim 3 we will develop a technique for automatic 3D segmentation and geometric modeling of the mitral valve and LV to allow for real-time risk-based repair/replacement stratification in the operating room for patients having surgery for IMR."

The overall goal of the PRSC is to provide COHCCC investigators with access to high quality, timely, and cost-effective pathology services that directly support both animal and human studies, and to provide access to ethically consented and procured human biorepository collections. The biorepository services include patient consenting to COH?s General Research Protocol, thus allowing the PRSC to procure residual solid tissue, additional bone marrow aspirate, and peripheral blood, as well as buccal cells and skin biopsies. With consent in place, biospecimens are ethically procured under the supervision of pathologists, processed, stored, and fully annotated following ISBER Best Practices and NCI Best Practices for Biospecimen Resources. The PRSC is preparing for College of American Pathologists (CAP) Biorepository Accreditation in late 2018. The PRSC also provides expert histopathology (solid and liquid tumors) and molecular and cytogenetics support for translational research by COHCCC investigators. The PRSC, including the institutional biorepository, is overseen by an Internal Advisory Board; the Director, Dennis Weisenburger, MD; and an operations Senior Manager, Karen Miller CLS, MT(ASCP). Oversight is provided by an interdisciplinary faculty Advisory Committee, and user feedback is obtained through an annual survey. The leaders of the laboratories sit on the Advisory Committee and are available for project design and technical consultation as needed. Since the last competing renewal, the PRSC, including the biorepository, was used by 183 unique investigators, 63% (n=116) of whom were CC members and representing all five Programs. The PRSC distributed 794 fresh frozen tissue aliquots, 674 aliquots of serum/plasma/buffy coats, 738 vials of mononuclear cells/peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC/PBMCs) (2015-2016 data), and 45,675 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections from clinical and research tissue blocks. The biorepository frozen tissue collection has grown to 20,500 solid tissues (tumor and paired normal tissue when available); 28,360 vials of MNC/PBMCs from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or apheresis products; 50,665 aliquots of serum; 41,620 aliquots of plasma; and 21,500 buffy coats from peripheral blood.

"9471305","This is a competitive renewal application of our currently funded Program Project (P01) award entitled ?Age- induced Impairment of Nutrient Signaling Results in Bone Loss?. Osteoporosis is a major public health problem affecting 44 million Americans. The estimated annual direct health-care cost for osteoporosis totaled $17 billion in 2001 and is rapidly rising. A critical barrier to correcting the problem of frailty and osteoporosis is a poor understanding of how nutrient-related stimuli and epigenetic mechanisms interact to induce bone and muscle loss. Our central hypothesis is that aging alters epigenetic regulatory systems (e.g., miRNA, acetylation) that act through nutrient signaling pathways on stem cells to affect musculoskeletal function. This project will improve scientific knowledge, technical capability, and clinical practice as they relate to age-induced muscle and bone loss by 1) defining specific epigenetic mechanisms that lead to bone and muscle loss with aging and 2) identifying specific nutritional interventions that can reduce or reverse these age-related changes. This is a highly integrated proposal from a group with an established track record of interactions, productivity and collaborations. Four individual projects, focused on epigenetic regulation and nutrient-related stimuli, comprise this application. The proposal also includes three Core facilities that will provide essential support to the Projects: an Administrative Core (Core A) that includes biostatistics and bioinformatics; a Bone Biology Core (Core B), which will provide the bone-specific techniques utilized by all the investigators; and a Bone Stem Cell Core (Core C) that will provide bone-derived cells to all investigators, including mouse and human bone marrow progenitor cells. The project has three specific aims: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that age-related changes in epigenetic signals alter musculoskeletal stem cell function; Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that specific dietary interventions (e.g., selective amino acid supplementation or intermittent fasting/protein feeding) can reverse age-related changes in epigenetic modifications and promote normal stem cell function; Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that relevant age-related epigenetic modifications identified in our mouse model are translatable to normal human physiology. The long-term impact of this project will be new findings on the epigenetic mechanisms underlying bone and muscle loss with age, and new countermeasures for reducing or reversing musculoskeletal aging."

One of the major challenges in the alcohol research field is to understand the neurobiological bases of the progressive transition from low/moderate social drinking to the heavy alcohol use which characterizes alcohol dependence. Repeated intoxications and withdrawal produce profound neuroadaptations in specific brain regions critical for the reinforcing effects of alcohol, such as the extended amygdala. In particular, chronic alcohol exposure causes neuroadaptations in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a brain area which plays a key role in chronic, pathological ethanol use and in withdrawal-induced negative emotional states. The BNST is very rich in a neuropeptide called pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), which is considered a master regulator of the major stress circuits in the brain. We have observed that excessive intermittent alcohol consumption causes a marked increase in PACAP levels in the BNST of both male and female mice, compared to control mice, suggesting that PACAP in the BNST may play a key role in regulating high levels of alcohol drinking.  The central hypothesis of this application is that PACAP neurons of the BNST represent a major system responsible for the transition to heavy alcohol use and alcohol dependence. We will test these hypotheses by means of a combined behavioral, neuroanatomical, molecular, and chemogenetic approach, which involves the use of PACAP-Ires-Cre mice. Specific Aim 1 will further validate the PACAP-Ires-Cre mouse line, characterize BNST PACAP neurons by examining its co-expression with other neuropeptide markers abundant in this brain region, and characterize BNST PACAP projection targets by means of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing a Cre-dependent fluorescent reporter gene. Specific Aim 2 will then determine the functional role of PACAP neurons of the BNST in the transition to alcohol dependence and heavy alcohol drinking, using a chemogenetic approach.  If successful, these experiments will lay the foundation for more extensive studies which may lead to the identification of a neuropeptide system with a critical role in heavy alcohol drinking and in the transition to dependence. A deeper understanding of the neuroadaptations produced by chronic alcohol will be essential for the discovery of novel therapeutic agents to alleviate alcoholism."
"9522730","ABSTRACT The symmetry of stem cell division is one of the most fundamental questions in stem cell biology, and a leading goal of our research is identification of the key metabolic pathways that regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate. We hypothesize that lipid metabolism contributes to HSC maintenance through precise control of division patterns. Single-cell approaches have identified the enhanced clearance of damaged mitochondria by fatty acid oxidation as an important mechanism of the self-renewing expansion of HSCs. However, our understanding of the relationship between HSC self-renewal and lipid metabolism is limited, as analyses of individual HSC division patterns have been hindered by both the heterogeneity of available HSC-enriched fractions and the technical challenges of imaging HSC fate in vivo. In addition, the number of cells required for full metabolomics analysis of rare populations of HSCs has proven prohibitive. To examine the activity upstream of fatty acid oxidation in HSCs, we have generated hematopoietic-specific conditional knockout mice for key genes impacting fatty acid oxidation pathway and/or fatty acid flow. A new biosensor for assessment of fatty acid oxidation activity in live cells has likewise been established to determine the metabolic modes which are most relevant to the controlled equilibrium of HSCs, and the gene-expression oriented bioinformatics tool, graphite, has been adapted to identify specific metabolite-dependent pathways. In order to illuminate the behavior of individual HSCs in vivo, we have established new technical regimens which include prospective isolation of HSCs with high purity based on Tie2 positivity, a local transplantation technique which delivers a single HSC under multiphoton microscopy guidance into the bone marrow of a live mouse, and micropipette aspiration to extract single cells after division directly from the bone marrow for functional or transcriptomic assay. Our project will utilize these advances to test our hypothesis regarding the roles of lipid metabolism in HSC fate choice. This in turn will facilitate novel therapeutic strategies for shifting the division balance of HSCs toward self-renewal through metabolic manipulation, and possibly contribute to improved clinical outcomes after HSC transplantation for non-malignant blood diseases. Thus, the goals of this proposal are three-fold: (1) In Aim 1, we will investigate the function of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in HSC division symmetry and explore a potential source of fatty acids to fulfill the requirements of HSCs; (2) In Aim 2, we will use the biosensor to identify key downstream metabolic targets of fatty acid metabolism for HSC fate and explore the measurement of the cellular metabolome in HSCs; and (3) finally, we propose in Aim 3 to directly examine in vivo HSC division symmetry, and the resulting division balance of fatty acid oxidation-defective HSCs will show definitively the in vivo relevance of fatty acid metabolism to HSC fate. If successful, the proposed research will positively impact the HSC field by providing a deeper understanding of the metabolic cues governing HSC fate decisions."
"9461015","PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States, about 62% of Medicare recipients ages 65 to 74 years have multiple chronic conditions (MCC; ? 2 chronic conditions), and the frequency increases dramatically to 82% above age 85. Because adults with MCC are at increased risk of functional decline and are particularly vulnerable to poor care, MCC threatens both the public and financial health of the United States. MCC prevalence may be reduced by delaying the onset of single conditions and combinations of conditions through modification of risk factors or determinants of diseases. However, current preventive efforts have partly failed because they have focused on one disease at a time and too late in life. For this reason, there is a critical need to identify groups of individuals at risk earlier in life, and to develop interventions to prevent MCC and their adverse health outcomes. These priorities were outlined in the Multiple Chronic Conditions Strategic Framework of the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) of 2010. A growing body of literature has described patterns of prevalent MCC in the United States and worldwide; however, the patterns of incidence of MCC and the outcomes of MCC remain poorly understood. In addition, the National Institute on Aging has recommended the novel approach of considering MCC as a proxy measure (clinical marker) of accelerated aging. Therefore, we will study the incidence and the rate of accumulation of MCC and the health outcomes of MCC across the entire life span. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) is an ideal environment to study the incidence and rate of accumulation of MCC, and the outcomes of MCC because it includes information for all ages from new- borns to death, regardless of insurance status or health care setting, and encompasses the full spectrum of care, from primary to tertiary care. In this application, we propose to study the incidence and life course accumulation of MCC using 18 selected somatic and mental health conditions across all ages (Aim 1), to study the short-term and long-term medical-records-based adverse health outcomes of incident MCC (Aim 2), and to study the short-term and long-term patient reported adverse outcomes of incident MCC (Aim 3). Understanding the incidence and accumulation of MCC, and its objective and subjective health outcomes is critical to enabling clinical and public health agencies to prevent and treat MCC, and to improve population health. In addition, these studies will identify persons at high risk of developing MCC early in life (accelerated aging). These persons may be selected for future studies of biomarkers (e.g., blood tests, genetic tests, imaging) or for preventive interventions to slow aging (e.g., specific drugs, dietary modification, lifestyle modification). Studying MCC as a clinical marker will advance our understanding of aging. In summary, the studies proposed here are novel, can be efficiently conducted using the REP, and are urgently needed."
"9493956","Project Summary This application requests funding to support the purchase of carbon-11 automation equipment for human PET radiotracer production. The Massachusetts General Hospital's Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging was home to the first combined Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)/Positron Emission Tomography (PET) human imaging system and now houses two MR-PET scanners as part of an imaging core that enables a broad community of users the ability to explore human neurochemical function and its relationship to disease. The scanners continue to be in high demand, with a large user base that has grown over the past seven years and comprises efforts from the departments of radiology, oncology, neurology and psychiatry. In fact, the facility boasts more than forty IRB-approved neuroscience protocols that use one or more of fifteen radiotracers approved for human use. Seven of these radiotracers are synthesized using carbon-11 and account for more than 80% of the MR-PET neuroscience research volume. The radiotracer production facility, which operates as a service core to its users, prepared approximately 300 human doses of carbon-11 radiotracer in 2016 per year for human use in addition to the hundreds of small animal and chemical research studies performed in that same year. Our success in building a user base has been particularly strong in the areas of neuroinflammation and neurotransmitter-neurovascular coupling research. At the same time, we are seeing new and rapidly growing communities of MR-PET users in the areas of epigenetics and neurodegeneration. Because of these, the demand for MR-PET imaging using carbon-11 has grown far beyond our volume capacity because of the limited number of automated systems that are capable of use with this isotope. The facility currently has a unit for producing [11C]methyl iodide from [11C]carbon dioxide (GE FXMeI) and another for converting the [11C]methyl iodide to a radiotracer, e.g. [11C]PBR28 (GE FXM). To help keep up with user demand, the radiotracer production facility staff has adapted an automated synthesizer designed for fluorine-18 labeling to work in the context of carbon-11. At this point, however, no options exist for further volume growth in carbon-11 radiotracer production for MR-PET imaging without the purchase of additional equipment. This issue is an especially pressing one given as currently only ~60% of the carbon-11 requests each month can be fulfilled. Staffing is sufficient within the facility to boost volume to nearly match the demand with the purchase and installation of a new double miniature hot cell housing a carbon-11 unit (FXMeI and FXM) for radiotracer preparation?the equipment for which we are seeking funding. The instrument upgrade enabled by the NIH shared grant mechanism will therefore play an integral role in supporting MR-PET imaging for investigators throughout the greater Boston research community, and thus in helping to solve a range of major neuroscience questions that we face. !"
"9457394","ABSTRACT Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors comprise a commonly prescribed class of drug that improves survival in patients with a variety of malignancies. Rash, particularly on the face, is the most common adverse event and occurs in 50-90% of patients, is severe in 10-20% of patients, lacks effective palliative options, and sometimes requires stopping cancer therapy. We have published qualitative research from patients who developed this rash and learned that it leads to cutaneous pain, psychological distress, and social isolation. One patient stated, My face looks so bad that if I go see my friends, they say, 'What happened to you.' I am self-conscious about that. Another commented, ?I just told them they would be better off just calling me, don't come visit.? Another described, I can feel the itch and burn all over. Some investigators have suggested that African American patients do not suffer these symptoms. Here, we hypothesize that they do, that their pigmented skin might camoflage the rash, but that this rash still causes them physical and psychological pain. Building on our data (a 933-patient epidemiologic study that shows rash is worse in men; pilot clinical trial data that show benefit with a topical anti-androgen; and an androgen-dependent gene profile from skin biopsies from patients with EGFR inhibitor rash) and on data from others (some melanocytes overexpress androgens and androgen receptors), we hypothesize this rash is androgen-driven and that the topical antiandrogen, ketoconazole, palliates it in all patients, including African American cancer patients. In Aim #1, we will interview African American patients who have developed this rash and will use novel qualitative methods to probe into their hypothesized psychological and cutaneous distress. In Aim #2, we will conduct a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with ketoconazole (a topical anti- androgen) to determine whether this agent palliates rash within a racially diverse cohort and to explore whether it does so by modulating androgen-dependent genes, as alluded to above. The long-term goal of this line of investigation is to reduce suffering and improve the quality of life of all patients -- including African American patients -- who suffer from EGFR inhibitor-induced rash."
"9677868","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surgery increases the risk of thrombosis but prevention and management of thromboembolic disease in the perioperative period is complicated by the risk of hemorrhage. Neutrophils (PMNs) play a vital role in wound healing, but their contribution to perioperative thrombosis and implications for thromboprophylaxis are now emerging. Adherence of PMNs to wounds and to the vasculature generates a unique localized sequestrum enriched in enzymes and antimicrobial peptides protected from plasma inhibitors that contribute to innate immunity in part through the orderly formation and dissolution of fibrin. We posit that post-operative and persistent inflammation disrupt this balance, predisposing to thrombosis by promoting formation and persistence of fibrin. We have previously observed that a-defensins (a-def), antimicrobial peptides that constitute 5% of total human PMN protein that are released upon activation, promote clotting and inhibit fibrinolysis. The absence of a-def in murine PMNs has hindered a better understanding of how these peptides contribute to thromboembolic disease in the perioperative setting. Using a novel transgenic mouse that expresses PMN a-def (Def++), we show that a-def circulates in a complex with fibrinogen and promotes polymerization and retraction of fibrin in vitro, deposits in the vasculature, induces occlusive arterial and venous thrombosis, and inhibits lysis of pulmonary emboli in vivo. These pathogenic properties can be transferred to wild type animals by transplanting bone marrow from Def++ mice and can be prevented and reversed by immunodepleting PMNs or by inhibiting a-def release using colchicine. We now propose an integrated approach to understanding the mechanism and implications of PMN a-def on perioperative thrombosis by examining: a) The biophysical effects of a-def on clot formation and structure; b) The mechanism of accelerated thrombosis and impaired fibrinolysis in Def++ mice and the salutary effect of blocking a-def release; and c) The utility of a-def expression as a biomarker for risk of venous thromboembolism post- surgery. These studies will provide insight into an unappreciated contribution of PMN a-def to arterial and venous thrombosis, identify novel genetic and protein biomarkers of patients at risk for surgery related thrombosis and provide evidence for the use of a safe and effective intervention to prevent thrombosis in the perioperative period."
"9645868","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) is the only NCI-designated cancer center in Georgia, which is now the eighth most populous state and has the largest land area among states east of the Mississippi River. As the main tertiary cancer care and cancer research institution in the state, Winship has committed its four research programs as supported by its six shared resources to address the specific challenges associated with the cancer burden in Georgia. These challenges include: high tobacco usage and incidence of tobacco- related cancers; high proportion of cancer patients who are African American or black and/or have significant cancer disparity issues in their care, prognosis, and/or outcome; and low health literacy levels. Winship's mission is to lessen the burden of cancer for the citizens of Georgia, its primary catchment area. This will be accomplished by: (1) seeking greater insights into the molecular, genetic, and epigenetic basis of cancer; (2) discovering new knowledge that drives improvements in cancer detection, prevention, and/or therapy; (3) developing or defining novel therapeutic targets and/or agents as a pathway to better cancer therapies; and (4) studying and implementing population-based strategies to lessen the cancer burden in the state. The 164 Winship core members are actively engaged in one of four Winship research programs, all of which have a strong emphasis on transdisciplinary research: Cancer Cell Biology, Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics. Winship's members are supported by six shared resources: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Cancer Animal Models Shared Resource, Cancer Tissue and Pathology Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Genomics Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Proteomics Shared Resource, and the Integrated Imaging Shared Resource; and two developing shared resources: Winship Research Informatics and Intervention Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Developing Shared Resources. Winship members are currently supported by $84.8M in total research funding (as of 3/31/2016) awarded via Emory University. Winship members Curran and Bruner serve as PIs on two NCI awards to the NRG Oncology Foundation for a total of $25.6M in support of clinical research infrastructure. Patient enrollment in Winship's interventional and non-interventional trials continues to increase, especially among patients from under-represented minority groups, and these activities have contributed to the FDA- approval of several novel anti-cancer agents during the present funding period. Winship has outstanding institutional commitment, with more than $200 million in institutional support committed over the next five years, a level almost twice that committed in 2011. Winship enjoys the same reporting line and organizational position as Emory's schools of medicine, public health, and nursing. Winship is uniquely positioned to apply its scientific strengths, outstanding membership, robust infrastructure, strong institutional support, and comprehensive training programs to fulfill its mission of lessening the burden of cancer on the state of Georgia and beyond."
"9457296","Project Summary Community-engaged research, focusing on patient-centered outcomes (PCO), is critical in translating scientific evidence into health benefits for the aging US population. There?s limited focus on understanding associations of sleep with brain health and cardiovascular disease (CVD) among older adults, particularly minorities who are disproportionately burdened by Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Consistent with the NIH roadmap of translating research into practice, it is paramount that health professionals be trained to pursue careers in PCO that promote healthy aging. The K07 leadership award will serve as (a) a collaborative learning laboratory and (b) a resource to stimulate, support, and evaluate high-priority translational aging research in diverse communities. It will coalesce a network of renowned investigators to tackle adverse sleep-related CVD outcomes in a diverse aging population. It will also address a critical deficiency in the academic workforce by mentoring junior scientists to pursue careers in translational behavioral research and to become effective mentors. The plan builds upon Dr. Jean-Louis? leadership in implementing community research and mentoring programs. Its strong likelihood of success is anchored by his outstanding experience engaging multiple stakeholders supporting aging-related research initiatives. The K07 plan will be implemented in an outstanding academic environment for translational behavioral research. It leverages several NYU resources, particularly those of the CTSI, the Center for Healthful Behavior Change, the Center for Brain Health, and the Sleep Disorders Center. Other enhancements to this environment include: 1) a community-academic partnership with a shared aging research agenda aiming to address important health needs of older adults, 2) access to a pool of 83 PRIDE scientists who will be coached to become Peer Mentors, and 3) Dr. Jean-Louis? leadership in a new fellowship program in translational behavioral sciences in NYU?s Department of Population Health. Dr. Jean-Louis? research program comprises several trials ascertaining effectiveness of tailored interventions to increase adoption of sleep health messages. These are complemented by use of mix-methods approaches to study psychosocial and cultural factors affecting health practices in diverse communities. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Provide a forum in which mid- to senior-level investigators in aging research will congregate to forge interdisciplinary collaborations, leading to submission of innovative research proposals; 2) Select and mentor 12 postdoctoral URM scientists with potential to become innovative and creative leaders in the scientific community, applying translational behavioral models to promote healthy aging; and 3) Coach 12 scientists who recently graduated from NYU?s PRIDE Institute to become Peer Mentors. This award will have a strong impact in increasing the academic workforce in sleep and ethnogerontological research."
"9484205","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The career goal of the K01 candidate is to become an independent investigator conducting research that contributes to the prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia through elucidating disease mechanisms and deriving individual risk profiles during the preclinical stage of the disease. The environment at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School is ideal for the candidate's training and proposed research, providing state-of-the-art imaging facilities and a world-renowned community of AD researchers and clinicians. During this K award, the candidate will extend her expertise in multimodal neuroimaging by receiving training in Tau PET imaging, and acquire expertise in genetic analyses to pursue a novel research path. The research plan proposed herein examines the influence of known genetic risk factors, specifically the APOE4 genotype and 21 non-APOE loci associated with clinical AD in large GWAS analyses, on the relationship between AD biomarkers and cognitive decline in clinically normal older individuals (CN). An understanding of genetic risk factors within CN is especially relevant given the ability to select CN with biomarker evidence of elevated A? (preclinical AD). Although longitudinal studies have converged to reveal that CN with preclinical AD are at heightened risk of subsequent clinical impairment, heterogeneity in decline exists within this group, such that some of these individuals remain clinically normal for an extended period of time. Identification of genetic risk factors that influence the time between initial A? accumulation and the onset of clinical symptoms will greatly enhance our understanding of preclinical AD and improve our ability to identify individuals most at- risk for cognitive decline. Although some of the effects of known genetic risk factors for AD dementia are undoubtedly mediated by elevated A?, we hypothesize that these factors also influence the AD trajectory by interacting with A? to accelerate downstream effects such as the accumulation of neocortical Tau, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline. Thus, for an equivalent level of A? burden, an individual with high genetic risk may show greater neurodegeneration than an individual with low genetic risk. This line of research should provide insight into why some A?+ individuals are able to remain clinically normal for longer periods of time whereas other A?+ individuals rapidly progress to clinical impairment. We will investigate these hypotheses in a large sample of 1777 CN combined across the Harvard Aging Brain Study (N=277), the Anti- Amyloid in Asymptomatic AD Study (A4, N=1000) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration Study (LEARN, N=500). All CN will complete amyloid PET, structural MRI, genotyping data, and longitudinal neuropsychological testing, and a large subset will additionally complete Tau PET imaging (N=827). Because disease-modifying strategies are most likely to be successful during the preclinical stage, elucidating AD disease mechanisms and deriving individual risk profiles during the preclinical stage will have tremendous impact on the prevention of AD."
"9520918","PROJECT SUMMARY  Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt placement allows children with hydrocephalus, a common cause of neurological disability in children, to survive and avoid ongoing brain injury. However, CSF shunts can frequently require surgical revision; and with each subsequent CSF shunt surgery, the risk of CSF shunt infection increases. The burden to children, families, and the healthcare system of over 2,000 CSF shunt infections annually in terms of costs, morbidity over the life span, and quality of life are substantial and preventable.  Two novel peri-operative techniques have emerged as recent advances to prevent CSF shunt infections: intrathecal instillation of broad spectrum antibiotics into the shunt during surgery, and the use of antibiotic impregnated shunt tubing, a more widespread, but expensive and controversial technique. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the comparative effectiveness of intrathecal antibiotics and antibiotic impregnated shunt tubing in the prevention of CSF shunt infection.  Compared to a clinical trial, use of large databases to study relatively uncommon events permits us to capitalize upon the existence of comprehensive information about large numbers of diverse patients for efficient analyses. The Pediatric Health Information System + (PHIS+) database includes detailed administrative, laboratory, microbiology, and radiology data for 6 large pediatric neurosurgical centers from 2007 to 2012; and PHIS+ includes over 6,900 CSF shunt surgeries, with over 1,600 receiving intrathecal antibiotics, over 1,245 receiving antibiotic-impregnated shunt tubing, and over 2,700 receiving prophylactic intravenous antibiotics alone (standard care).  Specific Aim 1 will compare the risk of infection following the use of intrathecal antibiotics, antibiotic impregnated shunt tubing, and standard care during CSF shunt surgery. The independent association of each novel technique compared to standard care, after adjusting for patient and procedure risk factors, with subsequent CSF shunt infection will be determined. We will also examine complications, length of stay, and readmissions. Specific Aim 2 will determine the changes in infecting organism and patterns of antimicrobial resistance following the use of intrathecal antibiotics, antibiotic impregnated shunt tubing, and standard care during CSF shunt surgery. Specific Aim 3 will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using intrathecal antibiotics, antibiotic impregnated shunt tubing, and standard care during CSF shunt surgery for the prevention of CSF shunt infection using cost data from PHIS+.  This proposal will rapidly fill a critical knowledge gap in prevention of CSF shunt infection, addresses a critical healthcare-associated infection, and its findings will rapidly be available for widespread dissemination."
"9674662","Abstract  Although the influence of metabolic rate on longevity has been studied and debated for decades, the cause:effect relationship between different parameters of energy metabolism and the process of aging is poorly understood and controversial. Hypopituitary Ames dwarf (Prop1df) mice and growth hormone receptor deleted (GHRKO) mice are remarkably long-lived and exhibit many features of delayed, slower and healthy aging. Many phenotypic characteristics shared by these mutants are believed to represent mechanisms of extended longevity. These characteristics include increased oxygen consumption (VO2) per gram of total or lean body mass and reduced respiratory quotient (RQ = respiratory exchange ratio, RER), indicative of increased reliance on lipids as metabolic fuel. Intriguingly, the increase in VO2 and the reduction in RQ in Ames dwarf and GHRKO mice disappear or are severely attenuated after 24 hours of acclimation to thermoneutral temperature. From these novel findings, we suspect that increased heat loss and the consequent increase in energy demand for thermogenesis in these diminutive mutants induce alterations in energy metabolism (increased VO2 and fatty acids ? oxidation; reduced RQ) that promote delayed, healthy aging and extended longevity. We hypothesize that chronic exposure of Ames dwarf and GHRKO mice to thermoneutral temperature will accelerate aging and reduce or eliminate their longevity advantage. We further hypothesize that chronic activation of thermogenesis in genetically normal (?wild type?) animals by exposure to reduced environmental temperature will induce metabolic characteristics that are associated with the delayed aging and extended longevity seen in GH-related mutants and thus lead to a slower rate of aging. As the first step in testing these hypotheses, we will determine whether characteristics associated with delayed aging are normalized by extended (weeks to months) exposure of long-lived mutant animals to thermoneutral environment and whether they can be induced by extended exposure of normal animals to reduced environmental temperature. Two Specific Aims are proposed.  Specific Aim 1. To determine whether chronic exposure of adult Ames dwarf and GHRKO mice to thermoneutral ambient temperature (30°C) will rescue (normalize) energy metabolism (as assessed by measurements of V02, RQ), glucose homeostasis, circulating adiponectin, IL-6 and lipid levels and expression of genes related to mitochondrial uncoupling in brown and white adipose tissue, metabolism, inflammation, insulin and mTOR signaling.  Specific Aim 2. To determine whether chronic exposure of adult normal (?wild type?) mice from the same strains to reduced environmental temperature (17°C) will induce alterations in thermogenesis, energy metabolism, glucose homeostasis, adipokine levels and expression of selected genes resembling those observed in long-lived GH-related mutants exposed to standard animal room temperature (23°C)."
"9475884","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduced layer 3 pyramidal cell dendrite length and complexity, spine density, and somal volume have been reported in multiple brain regions, including in primary auditory cortex (AI), in schizophrenia (Sz). Because these structural features are critical for signal processing, they likely underlie the correlated observations of impaired auditory processing and auditory cortex gray matter volume reductions in Sz, and contribute to disability. Dendrite length, complexity, and spine density are shaped by the effects of activity-dependent glutamate signaling on the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton; disruption of this signaling causes structural reductions similar to those in Sz. During the current funding period we have found alterations of proteins at multiple points within this pathway: presynaptic- SYN1, SYP; receptor- GRIA3; signal transduction- kalirin-9, MAP2. These findings have led us to hypothesize that glutamate signaling to the cytoskeleton is altered in AI in Sz, and contributes to the impairments in pyramidal cell structure. We now propose to test this hypothesis in an integrated set of experiments designed to delineate the specific nature of the alterations in these proteins within AI using a combination of targeted proteomics of synaptosomal preparations and quantitative fluorescent microscopy in human tissue (Aim 1 & 2); to determine the mechanisms by which these alterations may lead to morphologic changes in layer 3 pyramidal cells using over-expression and RNAi for WT and mutant kalirin-9, RhoA, RAC1 and MAP2 constructs in vitro and in layer 3 pyramidal cells in AI in vivo (Aim 3); and to place the alterations in the context of the larger glutamate signaling network in AI using targeted proteomics and network co-expression topology analyses (Aim 4). These Aims provide potential translational impact by examining proteins (i.e. possible drug-able targets) and by the integration of approaches such that alterations can be discovered, and their specificity delineated in diseased tissue, and then their mechanisms determined in model systems. Inclusion of an in vivo model provides a bridge to future studies to test interventions derived from our mechanistic findings with the goal of preventing morphologic changes in layer 3 pyramidal cells in AI and assessing the effects on auditory function."
"9492078","Abstract Mood disorders are highly disabling and affect 60 million Americans. Individuals experiencing mood symptoms and comorbid conditions (e.g., anxiety) also experience a decrement in their ability to use working memory in everyday life. Understanding neurobiological characteristics of cognitive and emotional dysfunction in distinct psychiatric disorders remains challenging because multiple psychiatric disorders share common patterns of disruption in brain functioning supporting cognitive and emotional processes. We propose to use a dimensional (RDoC) approach to analyze already collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify aberrant neurobiological mechanisms of continuous constructs of depression (ranging from no depression to sub-threshold depression to syndromal depression) and mania (ranging from no mania to sub-threshold mania to syndromal mania) symptoms and their relationship to working memory dysfunction. This 2-year study will merge clinical, behavioral and neuroimaging data from five studies (PI: Phillips) and analyze the merged large dataset across diagnoses using a dimensional approach. We will determine the relationship between behavioral and neural correlates of working memory and current and life-time symptoms of depression, mania, and comorbid anxiety in youth (8-17) and adults (18-45). We will validate these findings using an independent dataset (Aim 1). We will also examine how longitudinal improvement/worsening of depression, mania and comorbid anxiety symptoms over the 6-month period affects adult subjects? ability to perform difficult working memory tasks and engage the working memory circuitry during those tasks across diagnoses (Aim 2). The development of working memory in youth involves improvement of the ability to recruit working memory circuitry during working memory tasks. This maturation process may be disrupted by worsening of mood and anxiety symptoms. We will use longitudinal data to map working memory circuitry functioning across a range of ages and developmental time frames, and across the range of syndromal and non-syndromal depression, mania and comorbid anxiety across diagnoses (Aim 3). The proposed research will lay the foundation for understanding neural mechanisms underlying longitudinal trajectories in depression, mania and anxiety spectrum symptoms. It will provide neurobiological targets to help guide personalized treatment and facilitate development of new interventions to alleviate working memory dysfunction in affected individuals."
"9462878","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As detailed in a recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, chronic pain represents a major public health concern, affecting 100 million U.S. adults and costing more than $500 billion annually. Aging confers increased risk for chronic pain, with half of older adults reporting persistent or recurring pain, and aging is associated with greater pain-related loss of physical and psychosocial function. Current knowledge regarding pain and aging is surprisingly limited, and an improved understanding of the neurobiological and psychosocial mechanisms underlying age-related changes in pain is critical in order to inform interventions aimed at reducing pain in the elderly. Indeed, NIA recently has issued a series of Program Announcements encouraging studies of pain from an aging perspective (Pain in Aging PA-13-058, 059, & 060), identifying this as a high priority research topic. Our research group has documented age-related changes in laboratory measures of pain sensitivity and pain modulation, such that older adults exhibit enhanced pain facilitation (e.g. temporal summation of pain) and diminished pain inhibitory responses (e.g. conditioned pain modulation). The age-related changes in endogenous pain modulation may in part explain age-associated increases in risk for clinical pain. Advancing our understanding of pain and aging will require a coordinated translational research effort buttressed by sufficient infrastructure tailored for this purpose. Ths K07 Academic Career Award proposes to develop a University-wide program designed to facilitate and expand multidisciplinary research in pain and aging and to provide physical and logistical infrastructure to support pain and aging research efforts. In support of this goal, the I will pursue a career development plan designed to increase his expertise in aging research, enhance his leadership skills, and broaden his mentoring capacity. In addition, the PI will be supported in these endeavors by outstanding External and Internal Advisory Committees comprised of national and international leaders in their fields. The long-term outcome of this initiative will be to enhance the portfolio of pain and aging research at the University of Florida elevating it to national prominence. This research goal with be achieved by addressing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 - To develop an active and focused multidisciplinary translational research program on pain and aging at the University of Florida; Specific Aim 2: To enhance physical and logistical infrastructure in support of clinical and translational studies on pain and aging; Specific Aim 3: To foster the emergence of the next generation of geriatric pain scientists by providing resources and mentoring in pain and aging for junior scholars at all levels of career development. Ultimately, development of the UF Pain and Aging Research Translational Initiative will greatly enhance the local research environment and will move the field forward through cutting edge research investigating the mechanisms underlying age-related changes in the experience of pain."
"9457515","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant proposal Building Enteric Infectious Disease Research Capacity in India describes a training program in public health and infectious diseases, which includes interdisciplinary, translational training in in enteric infectious disease and the response to oral vaccines in developing countries. Enteric infectious diseases are the second major cause of post-neonatal mortality in under-5 children in developing countries, and cause both direct morbidity and sequelae in the form of growth faltering and possibly delayed cognitive development. The poor performance of oral vaccines in low-resource settings makes intervention challenging and a goal of this program is to focus training on inter-disciplinary studies on immunology and the role of gut microbiome in influencing the response to infection and immunization in India. Over the last nine years, a collaborative partnership between investigators at Tufts Medical Center/Tufts University School of Medicine (Tufts) and the Christian Medical College, Vellore (CMC) has established training with an initial focus on epidemiology, risk assessment and surveillance of enteric infections. Building on our knowledge, experience, and collaborative relationships, in this renewal application we will put greater emphasis on interventional clinical research, the enhancement of quantitative skills and in bio-informatics particularly related to the analysis and interpretation of metagenomic studies to develop a more translational approach during the next five years. We will expand the pool of potential trainees to all parts of India and the mentors to include faculty from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta and Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), Houston. The goals of extending training in a variety of disciplines necessary to investigate gastrointestinal infections and immune response to oral vaccines with special emphasis on clinical research, vaccinology and bioinformatics, facilitating the transition of trainees to independent research and of working with the Indian government for prioritization of research and training and aid translation of research results into public health practice will be met by a tiered training program with three levels of trainees who will be trained in India and in the US, and who will carry out research projects in India. In each of 5 years, one long term and one intermediate term trainee will be supported with a basic training package, mentored research project development and conduct and continuing professional development. Long-term and intermediate term trainees will be either at the pre-doctoral or the post-doctoral level, with a focus on post-doctoral candidates as far as possible. In each year, one short-term (faculty level) trainee will be selected to attend either targeted training or a short course identified as being relevant to the research training goals of the program. Of a total of 15 trainees, we expect at least 2-3 doctoral degrees and at least 4 competitive research grants to be obtained by the trainees as post-doctoral trainees or faculty. Based on prior results, we expect an average of at least 10 publications annually to which trainees will contribute. Each long term trainee will be expected to have at least 2 first authored publications, and each intermediate term trainee will be expected to have one paper. In addition, the program faculty with work with the Department of Biotechnology's Clinical Service Development Agency to develop a credit based program-the Indian Clinical Researcher Development (InCReD) program which is intended as a new paradigm for providing research skills to 15-20 junior faculty annually at medical schools in India through a combination of distance learning and contact courses. The multi-disciplinary and complementary training, networking and career development support are expected to result in a sustainable research program with significantly increased skills and capacity for infectious disease research in India."
"9457492","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Large-scale genomic investigations have begun to illuminate the genetic contributions to major psychiatric illnesses. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), rare large effect variants provide novel causal anchors to understand its neurobiological basis, and to understand convergence and divergence in disease mechanisms. These findings, not unlike other psychiatric disorders, also emphasize extreme genetic heterogeneity. We and others have shown that gene and protein networks provide an organizing framework for understanding heterogeneous psychiatric disease genetic risk in a unified biological context. The emergence of large-scale genomic and epigenetic data from human brain, and growing knowledge of genetic variation involved in ASD and other psychiatric diseases, coupled with advances in methodology, provides an unprecedented opportunity for comprehensive integrative analyses. We bring together a collaborative group of investigators, each with distinct areas of expertise critical for understanding psychiatric diseases, that have not been combined before, to develop a framework for integrative genomic network analysis. The work proposed here represents an ambitious multi-PI project (UCLA/UW, MGH/Harvard, and Johns Hopkins) that brings together 3 principal investigators and collaborators with strong publication records and expertise in all approaches necessary to perform this work using state of the art and novel methodologies. Through close collaboration we aim to develop a comprehensive framework and test optimal methods for integration of gene expression and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks in the brain with genetic and epigenetic data - networks that will be iteratively refined using experimental data. We will construct networks representing multiple brain regions in adulthood and development through rigorous combination of multiple transcriptomic data sets from ASD and control brain, developing and validating methods for integration of splicing and expression levels within gene networks (Aim 1). These networks will be refined to inform tissue specific PPI inference, validated via experimental tissue-specific PPI (Aim 2). We will further identify causal drivers by integration of genetic and epigenetic data, identifying QTL effects on RNA, splicing and protein levels (Aim 3). We will experimentally validate network regulatory predictions for a subset of putative causal drivers prioritizing network hubs and ASD associated genes (Aim 4). In addition, we will use our networks to predict high likelihood risk genes, whose relationship to ASD will be assessed using data from large-scale sequencing in ASD and related psychiatric disease cohorts, as well as our own focused experimental validation via multiplex inversion probe (MIPs) sequencing (Aim 4). Completion of these aims will lead to more valid and comprehensive CNS networks thereby significantly advancing our understanding of ASD associated variants and causal neurobiological pathways. As is our usual practice, our data, networks, and all code will be made freely available in a web-based format to be of maximum utility to the community."
"9559056","PROJECT SUMMARY The development and commercialization of microfluidic-based single cell RNA-seq platforms has enabled the transcriptomes of thousands of single cells to be profiled at a time, allowing researchers to differentiate between cell types and study cell fate decisions. However, none of these new technologies can correlate single cell genetic or epigentic variations with gene expression at high throughput. Fundamentally, current microfluidic technologies are either too inflexible to perform multiple types of sequencing on the same single cell, or are too low throughput to address many biological questions. We will overcome this limitation by utilizing a new microfluidic technology, Printed Droplet Microfluidics, to build a platform to perform high throughput single cell multi-omics. Printed Droplet Microfluidics utilizes a unique droplet microfluidic print head that serves as a deterministic single cell and droplet printer, and allows nanoliter-scale fluidic manipulations to be performed in an array format, including multiple protocols on the same single cell lysate. In this project, we will build a platform to perform chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and transcriptome sequencing on 1000 single cells. In Specific Aim 1, we will adapt a single cell RNA-seq protocol to the printed droplet array, and develop methods to identify the original geographic location of a cell in the RNA-seq data. In Specific Aim 2, we will develop a high throughput single cell ATAC-seq protocol in an array format, with methods again being developed to positionally label single cell ATAC-seq data. Achievement of these aims will prove that multiple single cell sample preparation protocols can be linked together and performed on the same single cell lysate. A proposed phase II project would involve full integration RNA-seq and ATAC-seq protocols, scaling throughput > 10,000 single cells, and early productization of the hardware and disposables."
"9557948","Noninvasive Seizure Screening in Preclinical Models of Epilepsy There is an urgent need for research into treatment options for epilepsy and other seizure disorders. Animal models are increasingly used to understand disease mechanisms and to screen promising therapeutic approaches. Animal epilepsy model use typically requires expensive and labor-intensive experimentation, with invasive EEG measurements being the preferred method of validation. This severely limits the pace and scale of investigation. In models of acquired epilepsy, animals usually undergo treatment to induce status epilepticus? a period of unremitting seizure?followed by a latent period during which the brain rewires itself to generate spontaneously recurring seizures, evidence of chronic epilepsy. The duration of the latent period and the likelihood that an animal will develop epilepsy are both uncertain. Animals must be observed for weeks to confirm epilepsy before they are ready for experimentation. During this latent period, seizures are commonly documented by visual observation or video review, which are tedious and prone to error. A commercial system for automated noninvasive seizure detection would therefore be attractive to epilepsy researchers. Signal Solutions, LLC, has developed technology based on piezoelectric sensors for noninvasive, high- throughput behavioral monitoring of rodents that is currently used by research groups around the world to identify genes related to sleep and circadian rhythms. The system discriminates sleep from wakefulness with over 90% accuracy. The Sunderam Lab at the University of Kentucky has further demonstrated using EEG analysis that these piezo sensors can be used to label REM and NREM stages of sleep in mice. In this STTR proposal, PI Sunderam and co-investigator Bauer will work with Signal Solutions to develop methods based on the piezo technology for accurate noninvasive seizure screening in rodent models of epilepsy. The result will be a validated system that minimizes the need for invasive and resource-intensive EEG analysis or tedious video monitoring. The objectives of the project are the following: 1. Test the feasibility of coarse detection of epilepsy onset in rodents using a noninvasive piezo sensor; 2. Train a piezo classifier to accurately detect and quantify seizures in rodents with confirmed epilepsy; and 3. Test the utility of a miniature piezo sensor for seizure screening and an infrared imager for seizure verification and severity assessment. The envisioned product is a turnkey system for convenient and noninvasive seizure screening in small animal models of epilepsy in custom or commercial cages. Potential customers include academic research labs as well as labs in the pharmaceutical sector engaged in high-volume screening of antiepileptic drugs."

"9474612","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma affects 70 million people worldwide [1, 2] and is characterized by optic nerve (ON) atrophy and the progressive death of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) [3]. Glaucoma is often associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), and current management aims at lowering IOP [4]. Yet although IOP-lowering treatments slow the development and progression of glaucoma, approximately 10% of people who receive proper treatment continue to experience loss of vision [2]. Therefore, investigation of the underlying mechanisms involved in RGC death is likely to improve our understanding of the disease pathophysiology and lead to novel therapeutic approaches.  Effective neuroprotection thus is urgently needed, but unfortunately there are no effective treatments available. Although apoptosis has been shown to be a major form of cell death, interventions based solely on inhibition of this important modality have failed to achieve the desired goal. We recently demonstrated that RIP kinase-mediated necrosis (also known as necroptosis) in addition to caspase-dependent apoptosis is involved in photoreceptor death in a retinal detachment model of retinal degeneration and that effective neuroprotection necessitates combination therapy.  We propose to study whether the RIP kinase pathway in combination with caspases can be a novel therapeutic target in animal models of glaucoma. We would like to expand our findings on the redundancy of cell death pathways from our work in photoreceptor degenerations to animal models of glaucoma. We propose to evaluate the neuroprotective and axonal regenerative effects of RIPK and Caspase Inhibition (alone and in combination) after optic nerve injury and examine the effects of RIPK inhibition and RIP3 deletion on autophagy and inflammasomes in RGC degeneration after optic nerve crush."

"9412770","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Alcohol abuse by current military personnel and Veterans is a significant health concern. Enlisted personnel returning from deployment are often young enough that brain maturation and refinement processes are still ongoing. Given the escalation of drinking and stress-related risk factors in this population, it is crucial to understand how alcohol affects the brain during this tme period and later on in life. To investigate the neurobiological processes that are affected by alcohol abuse during this critical period of brain development, we replicate the blood alcohol levels seen in humans during alcohol binges by use of a chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) paradigm. Our lab has previously shown that rats exposed to this ethanol paradigm during late stage brain development undergo changes in brain physiology that manifest as impaired learning and memory even into adulthood. Until recently, the field has primarily focused on alcohol's specific effects on neurons and neuronal signaling. Here, we instead propose to elucidate the contributions of the non-neuronal glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia, as a novel approach to understand the cellular mechanisms that underlie synaptic dysfunction resulting from repeated ethanol exposure. Astrocytes, in particular, play a critical role in synaps formation, neuronal maintenance, and synaptic repair after injury through the release of astrocyte- secreted factors. However, when astrocyte signaling goes awry, the resulting stress placed on neurons contributes to the pathology of disease states, such as epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Using our CIE paradigm in rats, we now have evidence that some of these astrocyte-signaling factors and their receptors involved in synapse formation are chronically upregulated in the hippocampus brain region into adulthood, well after the acute effects of alcohol exposure have subsided. This upregulation corresponds with disruptions in hippocampal synaptic structure and function, highlighted by selective deficits in a spatial memory task. These results suggest that the upregulation in astrocyte-secreted factors may contribute to the observed structural and functional neuronal changes observed after CIE, leading us to hypothesize that changes in astrocyte function during CIE contribute to these observed synaptic deficits. Intriguingly, pharmacologically inhibiting the interaction between one of these secreted factors and its neuronal receptor during the acute response to CIE prevented the upregulation of this receptor at later time points, strengthening our hypothesis that changes in astrocyte function during CIE are driving the protracted synaptic deficits. Astrocytes and microglia have also been known to initiate and respond to inflammatory signaling cascades induced by excessive alcohol exposure, but here we propose to investigate whether the inflammation is linked to the upregulation of glial signaling factors and the disruption of synaptic structure and function observed after CIE. In summary, this proposed work uses a novel cellular approach to unravel the mechanisms of brain injury and dysfunction that occur after alcohol abuse, implicating astrocytes as potential targets for innovative therapeutic strategies in line with the VA mission."
"9523705","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Biliary atresia is the most common cause of end-stage cirrhosis in children and the number one indication for pediatric liver transplantation. It results from an inflammatory and fibrosing obstruction of extrahepatic bile ducts that presents as neonatal jaundice. Despite prompt diagnosis and surgical treatment, the disease progresses and causes substantial morbidity and mortality. Although the etiology remains largely undefined, studies pursuing the previous aims of this award have advanced knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms of disease. Specifically, we uncovered a sequential activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems, with a prominent type-1 inflammatory response that targets the cholangiocytes and promotes epithelial injury. Consistent with a multifactorial basis of disease, we also found type-2 signals and directly linked them to a novel paracrine circuit involving lineage-negative (Linneg) cells functionally committed to type-2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) that secrete soluble mitogenic factor(s) to neighboring cholangiocytes. In this competing renewal application, we provide substantial preliminary data that forms the rationale for a unifying hypothesis that novel immature immune cells in the liver and bile ducts have dual roles as regulators of the immune response and the source of survival signals. This hypothesis will be tested in three closely related but independent aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate how ILC2s use amphiregulin (Areg) to promote epithelial repair in bile ducts. This will be done by validating initial findings that Areg induces cholangiocyte proliferation in vivo, the molecular mechanisms of growth, and how Areg signaling protects neonatal mice against the virus-induced phenotype of biliary atresia. In Aim 2, we will define the tissue population by Linneg cells and their roles in epithelial proliferation. This aim builds on initial experiments using single-cell sequencing strategies that show the functional commitment of Linneg cells based on their population of the hepatic or biliary environments. Following validation of these cells using complementary technologies, we will directly examine how novel bile duct- resident BIM cells and their expression of IL-6 regulate cholangiocyte proliferation and epithelial injury in experimental biliary atresia. And in Aim 3, we will determine how Linneg CR71+ cells that exist in extramedullary hematopoietic cells that reside in the neonatal liver promote biliary atresia. Based on preliminary data, we propose studies to explore their role as a susceptibility factor for experimental biliary atresia, and to investigate the mechanisms they use to quench the inflammatory response of neonatal myeloid and NK cells. Upon completion, the proposed experiments will advance our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of disease and uncover new cell groups and molecular signals that promote repair of the injured tissue, thus identifying potential targets for new therapies to block progression of disease and foster long-term survival of patients with biliary atresia."
"9539335","Project Summary The goal of the proposed project is to investigate the cellular and molecular consequences of splicing factor (SF) mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). These blood diseases are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis manifested as peripheral blood cytopenias and dysplastic morphological changes and increased propensity for progression to acute leukemia. Recently, somatic mutations in RNA binding proteins with known roles in splicing, commonly referred to as splicing factors (with the three most common being SF3B1 K700E, U2AF1 S34F and SRSF2 P95L), were revealed as the most common class of mutations in MDS affecting more than half of patients. SF mutations occur early in the disease and are, therefore, likely critical for its pathogenesis and attractive therapeutic targets. Early studies using primary patient cells, mouse models and ectopic expression in cell lines using RNA-seq suggest that the mutations alter the RNA binding specificity of the mutant SFs. However, the downstream events that are critical for the disease pathogenesis are still elusive and the RNA binding specificity of the mutant factors has yet to be directly tested. Population genetics studies have shown that different mutations co-occurring with SF mutations are associated with different clinical outcomes (poor or favorable prognosis). Co-occurrence of DNMT3A with SF3B1 mutations is associated with good prognosis, whereas co-mutations of SF3B1 with either RUNX1 or ASXL1 confer poor prognosis. However, the mechanisms underlying these genetic interactions are not understood. The Papapetrou lab has pioneered the modeling of MDS using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models. Human iPSC models are particularly attractive for the investigation of SF mutations, as alternative splicing isoforms show poor conservation between mice and humans. I propose to develop novel iPSC-based models of SF mutations and cooperating mutations to study the role of these mutations and their genetic interactions in MDS pathogenesis. Specifically, I propose to: (1) generate iPSC lines with the three most common canonical SF mutations SRSF2 P95L, SF3B1 K700E and U2AF1 S34F using CRISPR/Cas9 and characterize them phenotypically and molecularly using RNA-seq and eCLIP- seq) and (2) generate SF3B1 K700E iPSC lines with additional mutations in either DNMT3A, RUNX1, or ASXL1 and characterize their hematopoietic phenotypes and transcriptomes. This work can generate new hypotheses about the mechanisms by which SF mutations drive MDS and reveal principles of mutational cooperativity in MDS pathogenesis."
"9493408","Abstract/Project Summary Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) affects 3% of children worldwide, yet the underlying cause(s) of this condition are poorly understood. Adolescent IS (AIS) commonly develops during the rapid growth phase in adolescence, leading to disfigurement, reduced pulmonary functions and chronic pain. We recently demonstrated that defects in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow underlie the development of AIS in a zebrafish model. Defects in ptk7, mutations in which are causative of IS in humans, or in genes important in cilia motility, disrupt CSF flow in zebrafish. This results in the formation of scoliotic curves during a rapid growth phase in juvenile zebrafish, mimicking the onset of this disorder in humans. We demonstrate that prevention of scoliosis in this model can be achieved by expressing wildtype genes products only in motile ciliated lineages in zebrafish. Importantly, we have used a temperature sensitive cilia motility mutant to demonstrate that zebrafish can recover from the onset of scoliotic curves if cilia motility is restored in a critical time window. In this proposal, we will take the next logical step by investigating how CSF flow is sensed and how the fish responds to this information. We will investigate the role of ciliated CSF sensing neurons in the spinal canal in the development of scoliotic curves in our IS model. We will determine if the recently identified POC5 gene in human IS causes defects in CSF generation or sensation as our model would predict. We will characterize the spatial requirements for motile cilia in our model, and determine if the immune response we detect impacts spinal curve progression. At the conclusion of this work, we will have needed insights into the mechanism underlying the development and progression of spinal curvatures in response to altered CSF flow. This information is crucial for exploration of strategies to limit, or prevent, human AIS."
"9520500","Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated  Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) ABSTRACT There is a clear need to develop improved tools to stratify risk in patients who seek emergency care for chest pain, one of the most common and potentially deadliest conditions encountered in acute care settings. The ECG has been the mainstay of initial evaluation of chest pain patients, yet is currently only diagnostic for a small subset of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Our well-rounded and collaborative team has been working together for the past four years to develop novel ECG interpretation algorithms that can greatly enhance the utility of the ECG in the early evaluation of acute coronary disease. This line of work is already substantiated by pilot studies that have identified candidate markers of ECG characteristics and preliminary algorithms that can identify patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction as well as those with very low risk of coronary artery disease. With these improved tools, emergency providers (physicians, nurses, and paramedics) will be able to streamline the care provided to these patients beyond the costly and time- consuming overnight observation for serial cardiac enzymes and provocative testing. This grant will provide needed resources for our team to enroll a cohort of over 1,800 patients needed to confirm the accuracy of these ECG markers and determine their maximal clinical utility as part of a risk stratification tool. It builds directly on our existing work in this area, which has already yielded necessary preliminary data and multiple joint publications. Validating this technology will set the groundwork for the future development and testing of targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction."
"9462902","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (http://pgc.unc.edu), now in its eighth year, is one of the most innovative experiments in the history of psychiatry. We have unified much of the field to enable rapid progress in elucidating the genetic basis of psychiatric disorders. We have 800+ investigators from 36 countries and >400K subjects. The PGC has attracted a cadre of outstanding scientists whose careers center on our work. The PGC has published 17 main papers plus 31 secondary analysis/methods development papers. The most important was the landmark Nature paper identifying 108 loci for schizophrenia (SCZ). Due to our open-source approach, there are 75+ papers that use PGC results, and we know of numerous groups that are using our findings to direct basic and applied research (including therapeutic development). More work is needed. Large amounts of new data will be available to the PGC in the next five years (largely without NIMH funding). We have developed a rigorous set of approaches that are yielding discoveries for all of the initial five disorders (which led to adding four new disorders). We thus have the unique opportunity to rapidly and efficiently increase our knowledge of common and rare variation in order to understand the causes and comorbidities of major psychiatric disorders. Our overarching goal is to identify actionable variation via the empirical evaluation of the etiological, clinical, nosological, therapeutic, and biological significance of our genomic findings. We will continue the highly successful work of the PGC in understanding the roles of common genetic variation by: (a) comprehensively analyzing historically large GWA samples for nine major psychiatric disorders; (b) evaluating how genetic risk scores impact development and clinical symptom patterns; (c) understand the genetic relationship among psychiatric disorders and across psychiatric disorders and many other CNS diseases. We will enhance our work on the discovery of rare variation by: (d) conducting mega-analyses of copy number variation across nine psychiatric disorders; (e) efficiently and inexpensively re-sequencing regions implicated by GWAS (200 candidate genes in 20,000 subjects); and (f) using the hundreds of clinicians in the PGC, identify rare densely affected pedigrees to enable searches for rare variants of strong effect. Successful completion of this body of work will advance knowledge of the genetic basis of multiple psychiatric disorders. Our goal is to deliver actionable findings, genomic results tht (a) reveal the fundamental biology, (b) inform clinical practice, and (c) deliver new therapeutic targets. This is the central idea of the PGC: to convert the family history risk factor into biologically, clinically, and therapeutically meaningful insights. We have leveraged external funding from multiple sources to minimize NIMH budgetary requests."
"9324444","Project Summary/Abstract Frequent binge drinking has been linked to numerous negative consequences, include and increased risk of developing ethanol dependence. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify neuronal mechanisms that modulate binge drinking as such knowledge will provide insight into novel pharmaceutical treatments that will protect against this dangerous behavior and the transition to ethanol dependence. Considerable attention has been paid to the reinforcing effects of ethanol and how these effects motivate ethanol intake. There is strong evidence that ethanol also entails aversive effects and that these effects, because they are clearly dose related, can act as a deterrent to overconsumption. One pre-clinical behavioral assay for the aversive effects of ethanol is the development of a conditioned taste aversion (CTA). When a taste is paired with a treatment which produces aversive internal symptoms, a strong aversion to the taste develops. Studies comparing different rodent strains suggest a link between sensitivity to the aversive effects of ethanol and the propensity to voluntarily ingest ethanol. Importantly, recent data show that mice selectively bred to achieve high blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) while binge drinking exhibit reduced sensitivity to the aversive properties of ethanol without alterations in sensitivity to ethanol?s reinforcing properties. Thus, binge-like ethanol drinking in these mice may be driven by reduced sensitivity to ethanol?s aversive effects. Because the neurocircuitry underlying the aversive effects of ethanol is still poorly understood, we propose to combine cutting-edged chemogenetic, molecular, and behavioral tools to characterize the neurocircuitry modulating aversive reactions to ethanol and binge-like ethanol consumption. Based on previous studies and compelling pilot data, we will test the novel hypothesis that brainstem norepinephrine (NE) nuclei, specifically the locus coeruleus (LC) and A2 region (caudal nucleus of the solitary tract; NTS), are activated during binge-like ethanol drinking and serve as protective mechanisms to ?break? ethanol drinking by promoting aversive responses. Specific Aim 1 will use Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) viral vectors to study the role of a NE circuit from the LC to the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) in the modulation of ethanol-induced CTA and binge-like ethanol consumption, and Aim 2 will use DREADD viral vectors to study the role of a NE circuit from the A2 region to the lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBN) in the modulation of ethanol-induced CTA and binge-like ethanol consumption. Aim 3 will use immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR approaches to test the hypothesis that binge-like ethanol drinking increases NE signaling in the LC and A2, and that this signaling will become blunted after repeated binge-like drinking episodes, a mechanism that may contribute to the transition to dependence. As the mechanisms underlying the aversive effects of ethanol are not well understood, and the roles of the NE circuits under investigation have never been studies with respect to neurobiological response to ethanol, the proposed studies are highly novel and innovative."

"9630673","ABSTRACT Globally, liver cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in men and the 6th leading cause in women. Alcohol abuse represents one of the major risk factors for liver cancer along with HCV/HBV infection and obesity. Evidence suggests that alcohol promotes hepatocarcinogenesis by increasing hepatocyte proliferation via activation of Wnt/?-catenin signaling and consequent induction of ?classical? Wnt target genes. However, the mechanisms by which other ?non-classical? Wnt targets mediate alcohol-promoted HCC remain largely unknown. To this end, we have discovered that stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 (Scd2) is a novel ?non-classical? Wnt/?-catenin target gene which is upregulated and required for the expression of co-receptor LRP5/6 and tumorigenic activity of liver tumor-initiating stem-like cells (TICs) isolated from HCV-induced and alcohol-promoted HCC in mice and human HCC cell lines. Further, our results demonstrate this Wnt-SCD-LRP5/6 positive loop involves SCD's ability to stabilize LRP5/6 mRNA via the 3'UTR AU-rich element (ARE) binding protein HuR which is also known for its ability to upregulate proinflammatory and tumor-promoter genes. Thus, we hypothesize that SCD enhances alcohol-promoted liver tumorigenesis through a positive feedback loop for canonical Wnt signaling via HuR-mediated LRP5/6 expression. To advance this hypothesis we will address the following aims as part of my K08 mentored research training toward academic independence: Aim 1: to determine the mechanism and significance of SCD-dependent, HuR-mediated LRP5/6 expression in alcohol-promoted liver tumorigenesis by investigating: 1) how SCD inhibition or knockdown (KD) reduces cytoplasmic HuR in TICs and Huh7 cells; and 2) whether ectopic LRP6 expression rescues the anti-tumorigenic effects of Scd2 KD in TICs in vitro and in orthotopically transplanted immune-competent B6 mice fed alcohol. Aim 2: to perform integrated bioinformatics analysis to determine whether expression of SCD, LRP5/6 and HuR per microarray analysis and desaturation of fatty acids per lipidomic analysis are associated with HCC and poor prognosis in three HCC patient cohorts. Aim 3: to determine whether hepatocyte-specific Scd2 ablation suppresses DEN-initiated and alcohol-promoted development of liver tumors in mice by using Albumin-Cre or AAV8-Ttr-Cre mediated liver-specific ablation of Scd2 in Scd2flox/flox mice."
"9455577","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A low-intensity, cognitive-behavioral self-management intervention for chronic musculoskeletal pain in older adults In an influential 2011 report entitled Relieving Pain in America, the Institute of Medicine called attention to the epidemic of chronic pain in the United States, and to the urgent need to improve access to effective pain treatments. Responding to the priorities set in this report, I am seeking to lay the foundation for an independent research program with the goal of increasing the accessibility of evidence-based, cognitive-behavioral interventions for chronic pain management among older adults. This application for a Mentored Career Development Award (K01) proposes training and research activities over a 5-year period that will enable me to launch this research program. To this end, I have formed an interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants that includes researchers representing Geriatrics, Anesthesiology, Psychology, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Public Health and Psychiatry at the University of Michigan, as well as a prominent pain ethicist from the independent Center for Practical Bioethics. This additional support will build on my strong foundation in conducting behavioral and chronic illness self-management support research among older adults. The training and research aims in this proposal are closely linked. The training goals include acquiring skills and expertise in the areas that are essential for my planned research program: 1) The pathophysiology and management of chronic pain in older adults and cognitive-behavioral approaches to treating chronic pain in this group; 2) Symptom and activity monitoring in older adults, which enables the use of accurate and timely information about patients' progress as part of behavioral interventions, while identifying potential mediators of intervention effects; and 3) Emerging study designs for testing behavioral interventions, with an emphasis on pragmatic, adaptive and patient-centered designs that increase the relevance of research findings. These topics will be mastered through coursework, clinical observations, and self-study under the guidance of the mentorship team. I will also attend relevant seminars, workshops, and scientific conferences throughout the award period. Following the training program, I will develop and pilot-test a low-intensity pain CBT intervention for older adults. The intervention will use a high tech/high touch approach. Using an evidence-based internet CBT intervention for chronic pain management as a starting point, I will develop two additional components that will enhance the appeal and potential efficacy of this program for older adults: a) a series of telephone CBT sessions by non-specialist practitioners to support use of the electronic modules, and b) symptom and activity monitoring using mobile health tools to better tailor the intervention to individual patients' needs. The development and pilot-testing of this program will be accomplished via three sequential research aims. To aid in the development of program content, in Aim 1, I will conduct secondary analysis of data from two recent RCTs of pain CBT interventions to test the hypothesis that there are significant age group differences in pain coping strategies and choice of CBT goals, and to identify the CBT skills that are most appealing and most challenging to older adults. I will also conduct focus groups to obtain feedback from target intervention users on the acceptability and design of the proposed facilitator and monitoring components. In Aim 2, I will conduct usability testing with older pain patients to test our assumption that using a FitBit-type device to automatically- upload accelerometer data results in markedly greater adherence to data collection than manual upload via IVR calls. We will also evaluate the reliability, validity and acceptability of both automated and manual upload to inform the final choice of monitoring strategy used in the pilot study. In Aim 3, I will recruit 50 older adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain and conduct a randomized pilot trial of the intervention with waitlist controls to assess its feasibility and effects on Pai Impact. If successful, results from the pilot study will serve as preliminary work for a larger pragmatic trial to be proposed in the final year of the K01. The University of Michigan, the School of Public Health, and the Center for Managing Chronic Disease provide the ideal environment for carrying out the proposed activities. These units offer opportunities for training, collaboration, and cross-disciplinary pollination. A wide array of resources will facilitate my wor during the award period; e.g., the Geriatrics Center and Institute of Gerontology, the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center, the Michigan Center for Clinical and Health Research, as well as world-class computing, library, and statistical support services. This resource-rich environment, along with a committed team of mentors, will facilitate my transition to an independent research career."

"9519843","Larger social networks and/or more frequent social interactions are associated with lower incidence of AD, at the population level; increasing social interaction may be a promising intervention for improving the cognitive well-being of older adults. In our previous randomized controlled behavioral clinical trial, we developed a conversation-based social interaction cognitive stimulation protocol delivered by trained interviewers through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface with a touch screen (ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT01571427). Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted over a 6- week trial period in the intervention group. Despite a small sample size, this pilot study (completed 6/30/2014) demonstrated feasibility, high adherence in an elderly population (mean age 80 years) and efficacy in language-based executive functions among the intervention group in comparison to the control group.  Based upon these positive results, we propose a Phase I trial to advance development of this intervention. Primary aim (Aim 1) is to examine the efficacy of our intervention on cognitive functions among the target group - those aged 80 and older with MCI and limited opportunities of social interactions. Our primary outcomes are cognitive functions in the domains of language, attention, executive and memory functions, and secondary outcomes are a targeted IADL function (medication use and adherence) and overall emotional well-being (mood, self-rated health). Person-specific levels of social interactions (i.e., average conversation outside of the trial) will be monitored and controlled in the analyses. Exploratory Aim 2 is to examine whether the intervention could lead to changes in speech and language characteristics over time by analyzing recorded daily conversational sessions, based on our promising cross-sectional findings in this area. Exploratory Aim 3 is to examine underlying mechanisms of efficacy by assessing pre- and post- trial changes inhippocampal, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, amygdala and other ROIsusing MRI and unbiased whole brain assessment (voxel-based morphometry), and structural and functional connectivity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional MRI (R-fMRI). A total of 144 MCI subjects will be recruited and randomized at Portland, Oregon, and Detroit, Michigan, collaborating with Meals on Wheels and Area Agency on Aging (AAA) at both locations, creating a large sampling frame of those with low income and from ethnic minorities. Half of the participants will be randomly selected and invited to participate in the brain imaging study.  Increasing daily social contact through communication technologies could offer a cost-effective home- based prevention that could slow cognitive decline, delay the onset of AD, and thereby reduce the overall societal burden of dementia. The oldest old is the fastest growing segment of the population in most developed countries, and face the highest risk of developing dementia and social isolation (risk factors of adverse health outcomes). User-friendly sustainable prevention approaches are urgently needed in this population."
"9458672","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing continuation for a grant entitled Biomarkers of Cognitive Decline among Normal Individuals: The BIOCARD Cohort' (see FOA: PAR-13-148). The BIOCARD study is a longitudinal, observational study of 349 individuals who were cognitively normal and primarily middle aged (mean age=57.1) at enrollment. By design, more than two-thirds had a family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The primary goal was to follow individuals from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, so that it would be possible to identify biomarkers that predicted progression. The rationale for this study design is that several lines of evidence indicate that AD pathophysiological processes begin to develop many years, if not decades, before AD dementia is diagnosed. This long prodromal phase provides a 'window of opportunity' during which symptoms are minimal (if present at all) but therapeutic intervention may have the greatest opportunity of success. The BIOCARD study is in a unique position to examine 'preclinical AD', since the participants: (1) have been followed for up to 18 years (mean follow-up = 12.1 yrs), (2) are entering a period of accelerating risk, and (3) 63 of those alive have developed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. Our overall objectives are to further advance the study of preclinical AD by: (1) clarifying the pattern and rate of changes in AD biomarkers (including CSF, MRI, amyloid imaging and blood) and cognition that occur, as well as evaluate potential new biomarkers, (2) maximizing our data by working collaboratively with several research groups who have comparable data, and (3) providing a publicly accessible database, to include biological specimens, for researchers in the field. The long duration of follow-up for the cohort is based on the fact that the study was established in 1995 by investigators in the intramural program of the NIH. The study was stopped for administrative purposes in 2005. Our investigative team was funded in July 2009 to re-enroll the participants and re-initiate longitudinal data collection. Wit this application, we are requesting funds to continue the longitudinal clinical and cognitive assessment of the cohort, collect more CSF, more MRI scans, and to initiate acquisition of positron emission tomography (PET), using [11-C] PiB, in the participants who remain cognitively normal (n=201). Though a number of studies around the world have begun to examine cognitively normal individuals with similar goals in mind, no study, to our knowledge, has up to 18 years of accumulated longitudinal data on changes in cognitive, CSF, and MRI measures first obtained when the subjects were cognitively normal and the majority were middle aged."
"9463330","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mitsugumin 29 (MG29) is a muscle-specific member of the synaptophysin family proteins that participates in controlling the maturation and development of the transverse-tubule (TT) structure and the maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ signaling in skeletal muscle. Genetic ablation of mg29 leads to defective TT structure in skeletal muscle, which show similarity to the abnormal TT network observed in animal models of, and human patients with, muscular dystrophy. The principal investigator of this application has obtained evidence that revealed an essential role for MG29 in controlling the TT membrane network in muscle physiology and diseases. Immunoblot showed that expression of MG29 was reduced in both human and mice with muscular dystrophy, indicating the possibility that MG29 may be involved in the development of muscular dystrophy. Using biochemical assay, we identified a functional interaction between MG29, dysferlin and Bin1, other TT- resident proteins with important roles in muscular dystrophy. Toward understanding the biological function for MG29 in control of TT biogenesis, we used the HMCL-7304 myoblast cell line derived from human muscle. Cultured myotubes derived from HMCL-7304 cells do not express MG29 and lack TT network. Preliminary study with rescue of MG29 in HMCL-7304 myotubes revealed the initiation of TT membranes. Establishing an in vitro system with control of TT membrane can potentially be a useful tool for muscle physiology research. The mg29 gene contains a unique 3' untranslated region (UTR) with potential binding sites for microRNA (miRNA) or RNA-stabilizing factors. Mutagenesis studies revealed that miR-181a could target a region in the 3'UTR that is highly conserved between mouse and human mg29 genes to exhibit a strong control of MG29 expression in skeletal muscle. Studies from other investigators have shown that miR-181 was significantly elevated in human patients with muscular dystrophy. These data suggest an intriguing possibility that elevated miR-181a may be a contributing factor for the reduced MG29 expression under muscular dystrophic conditions. Experiments outlined in this proposal will focus on testing the hypothesis that MG29 is an integral component of TT biogenesis in skeletal muscle, and miRNA-mediated control of MG29 expression contributes to changes in TT integrity during muscular dystrophy. First, by using in vitro cell culture and in vivo transgenic animal approaches, we will discern the biological function for MG29 in control of TT integrity and remodeling in muscle physiology and dystrophy. Second, we will elucidate the mechanisms that underlie miRNA-mediated control of MG29 expression in skeletal muscle, and to identify the mechanisms that contribute to reduction of MG29 in dystrophic muscle. Using AAV-mediated gene delivery of antagomir into the mdx mice, we will test whether suppression of miRNA-mediated down-regulation of MG29 expression can improve TT structure and rescue muscle strength in dystrophic muscle."
"9473105","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a strong influence of gravity on the lung. The lung deforms under its own weight, stretching some regions and compressing others, affecting ventilation and blood flow. The deformation is strongly posture dependent because the thorax (the container shape) is not symmetrical. This asymmetry can be envisioned as a wedge, with the lung hanging from the shorter side in supine posture and the longer side in prone. The effects of asymmetry and gravity are additive in supine posture, but oppose one another in prone.  Goal/Significance Early adoption of prone ventilation in severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) markedly improves survival. This is especially true if arterial partial pressure of CO2 and dead space are decreased by prone posture, implying that this intervention recruits blood flow to match regions of well-ventilated lung. Our goal is to understand the mechanisms by which lung deformation and thoracic shape interact to affect pulmonary blood flow and gas exchange. Since prone ventilation greatly complicates patient care, understanding posture effects on blood flow distribution is critically important. This information will be to develop patient-specific metrics to identify which ARDS patients might benefit most from prone ventilation. This work may have other implications for patient management including fluid balance and inotropic therapy.  Innovation Can the effects of prone posture on pulmonary blood flow and gas exchange be predicted from regional lung density distribution measured supine? To answer this question we have developed a suite of functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques that allow regional quantification of lung proton density, alveolar ventilation, and perfusion. This allows the evaluation of how container shape and lung deformation alter ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) matching and regional dead space under clinically relevant conditions. We propose to combine our sophisticated imaging techniques with person-specific modeling of tissue deformation in collaboration with Dr. Merryn Tawhai (University of Auckland) to calculate regional tissue deformation and trans-pulmonary pressure gradients and evaluate the effect on local blood flow and VA/Qmatching.  Approach we will test the hypothesis that regions of highly stretched (high local trans-pulmonary pressure) lung corresponding to regions of high V /Q ratio in supine posture will be reduced in prone posture. A resulting in more uniform V /Q matching. In normal subjects we will use data acquired in supine posture A combined with person-specific modeling to predict the effects on blood flow and VA/Q matching in prone posture, and test our predictions against measurements made in prone posture. This information will be used to develop biomarkers for optimal blood flow based on density distribution and thoracic shape (and thus measureable with routine clinical CT) that predict improvement with prone posture. This will be tested in collaboration with Dr. Harm Bogaard (VU Univ. Amsterdam) in a retrospective study of patients with ARDS who have undergone prone ventilation."
"9441047","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our goal is to identify genes that increase risk for affective and psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. Although these highly heritable diseases are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, their etiologies remain poorly understood. Identifying genes that contribute to their risk should provide critical information leading to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. We propose an eight site international consortium designed to identify rare causal variants for affective and psychotic illnesses using extended multiplex pedigrees. These multigenerational families were previously identified and include at least three individuals with confirmed diagnoses. We focus on the identification of rare variants (with population MAF d 0.01) that have a large absolute effect size, although it may be present in a small number of related affected individuals. While such rare functional variants may have a small effect on population attributable risk or variant-specific heritability, they can be sufficient to verify tha a given gene is involved in illness risk. Pedigree-based studies represent an implicit enrichment strategy for identifying the rarest (e.g., private or pedigree-specific) variants, as Mendelian transmissions from parents to offspring maximize the chance that multiple copies of rare variants exist in the pedigree. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) allows a comprehensive search for rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or more complex sequence variation such as CNVs or INDELS. To identify rare, potentially private, variants that increase risk for affective or psychotic illness, we will create a repository of 4043 individuals from previously collected multiplex pedigrees (n=331) that will be analyzed with WGS. 1915 of these individuals have available WGS and we will obtain sequence data for 2128 additional subjects. Phenotypes include classical dichotomous diagnoses, quantitative scales derived from standardized interviews reflecting dimensional symptom classes, and neurocognitive endophenotypes. Our specific aims are to: 1) synergize phenotypic assessments, create dimensional indices of psychopathology, and rank endophenotypes across sites; 2) obtain WGS on 2128 individuals from extended pedigrees by direct sequencing of 1000 samples at 30x coverage and perform highly accurate pseudo-sequencing using a high density SNP framework to obtained the remaining 1128; 3) localize and identify QTLs influencing illness phenotypes /endophenotypes; 4) perform pedigree-based genome-wide association using likely functional variants; 5) identify rare functional CNV/INDELs influencing illness risk or endophenotypes; 6) perform gene-centric association tests in an independent sample. Our collaborative project includes applications from Yale University (DC Glahn, PD/PI), Texas Biomedical Research Institute (J Blangero, PD/PI) and the University of Pennsylvania (RE Gur, PD/PI). In addition, the Universities of Pittsburgh (V Nimgaonkar), Costa Rica (H Ravents), Edinburgh (AM McIntosh), and Western Australia (A Jablensky) and the intramural NIMH (F McMahon) will participate."
"9441032","PROJECT SUMMARY Extant animal and human data show that ovarian hormones are critical neurobiological risk factors for binge eating in women. Natural increases in these hormones across the menstrual cycle substantially increase risk for binge eating via hormonally induced increases in genetic risk. These data have significantly advanced etiological models and our understanding of the female predominance in eating disorder risk. However, this increased knowledge comes with an urgent public health responsibility. In the US today, 1 in 3 women take contraceptives that contain combinations of hormones that mimic the riskiest milieus for binge eating (i.e., combined oral contraceptives (COCs) containing both estrogen and progesterone).The relatively commonplace prescription of COCs may substantially increase risk for binge eating in women, particularly in those who are genetically vulnerable to eating disorders. This possibility underscores the urgent need to examine COC effects on binge eating to inform women's health practices and avert a potentially dangerous (and chronic) path toward eating disorders in unsuspecting young women. The goal of the proposed project is to use a multi- method (behavioral genetic, neuroendocrine), longitudinal twin study to document the effects of COCs on phenotypic and genetic risk for binge eating in women. If COCs increase phenotypic risk for binge eating in women, then there should be significantly higher rates of binge eating in twins using COCs than their non- using co-twins (a population-level, between-subject effect) and substantial increases in binge eating when COC users transition from inactive to active pills (an individual-level, within-subject effect). Moreover, if COCs influence binge eating through genetic mechanisms, then there should be significantly increased genetic risk in twins taking COCs (a population-level, between-subject effect) and substantial increases in genetic effects when COC users transition from inactive to active pills (an individual-level, within-subject effect). We will examine all of these hypotheses in a large sample of female twins (N = 1,000) assessed daily for 45 days using multiple measures of binge eating and related phenotypes. Notably, the proposed project would directly address NIH directives to enhance Rigor and Reproducibility through its validation of cross-sectional findings (e.g., increased binge eating in COC twins vs. their non-using co-twins) with longitudinal data (i.e., increased binge eating when transitioning from inactive to active pills) within a twin study design that substantially minimizes confounders and selection factors into COC use. The inferential power gained from these multi-level analyses has the potential to significantly advance public health policy and necessitate a re-thinking of basic assumptions about COC prescriptions and use. The clinical implications of our findings run the gamut from requiring physicians to screen for personal and family histories of eating disorders (an uncommon practice) to the selection of alternative contraceptives that are less risky for women."
"9521155","Project Summary. Zika virus (ZIKV; Flavivirus) is transmitted to humans by the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti and poses significant health risks to the Americas (1, 2).This phase I project from Colorado State University (CSU; Olson and Black), University of Missouri (MU; Franz) and University of Notre Dame (UND; Fraser) will apply gene drive technology to generate Ae. aegypti populations refractory to ZIKV and other arboviruses transmitted by this vector species. Our gene drive approach is based on Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 for rapid, effective, genetics-based population modification of Aedes aegypti. Our principal goals are: 1) apply two validated Anti-Viral Trans Gene (AVTG) strategies that target ZIKV to minimize or ablate ZIKV infection of Ae. aegypti, 2) generate transgenic Ae. aegypti that express the AVTGs in the context of a CRISPR/Cas9 (CC) gene drive system, 3) show that the genetically modified mosquitoes have a stable, refractory phenotype for ZIKV infection, and 4) validate gene drive (in indoor cage studies) by introgressing the AVTGs into an Ae. aegypti population to convert the population from a competent to a refractory infection phenotype. Previously, Drs. Olson and Franz have genetically modified Ae. aegypti (with no drive) that stably express DENV2-specific, inverted repeat (IR) RNAs forming dsRNA to trigger the small interfering (si)RNA pathway of RNAi in the mosquito (3, 4). Dr. Fraser has developed mosquito cell lines that express group I intron (GrpI) ribozymes targeted to a highly conserved region of arboviral genomes. He has already developed GrpI ribozymes that target all four DENV serotypes and chikungunya virus (CHIKV; Alphavirus) (6, 7). In this proposal, we will initially develop siRNA- and ribozyme-based anti-viral genes to target ZIKV in the context of CC gene drive. We will compare the two AVTG strategies with CC gene drive to see which is the most effective at suppressing mosquito infection. If the GrpI AVTG genes successfully suppress vector competence and spread the ZIKV AVTG into caged populations of Ae. aegypti, we will use other GrpI AVTGs with the CC drive system to additionally target DENVs and CHIKV. CC gene drive has already been used to efficiently modify cage-populations of Anopheles stephensi with anti- pathogen genes (8). We are confident we can adapt this approach to drive antiviral IR RNA and ribozyme AVTG genes to greatly reduce or ablate Ae. aegypti competence for transmitting ZIKV. The CC-AVTG system we propose will target two Ae. aegypti genome sites (TIMP P4 on chromosome aem 2q and 3'UTR polyadenylate binding protein (PABP on arm 3q). We use the ?2-tubulin promoter to express Cas9 to achieve gene drive through the male germ-line. This will maximize homology-dependent repair (HDR) to maintain drive over non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) which impairs drive (9). This proposal represents a significant step towards developing and optimizing CC drive with AVTGs in Ae. aegypti. This effort will be foundational for using CC drive in Ae. aegypti for disease control We are confident the project greatly advances population replacement as a tool for potentially mitigating arbovirus transmission."
"9457825","ABSTRACT  We aim to better understand the links between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Although the literature supports their association, the underlying mechanisms are not known. A number of obesity-associated comorbidities contribute to cerebrovascular abnormalities in T2D; among them: impaired glucose control, low grade systemic inflammation, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea. These comorbidities provide possible mechanistic links between T2D and dementia. Importantly, this group of comorbidities (here referred to as ?modifiable vascular factors?) improve with weight loss. In addition to the fact that T2D is related to a doubling of all-cause dementia, individuals with T2D and those with prodromal AD, share a cluster of CNS abnormalities (here referred to as ?CNS impairments?): memory deficits, hippocampal atrophy, reductions in cerebral glucose uptake in AD-vulnerable regions, and decreased cerebral blood flow. This overlap in CNS abnormalities supports a potential common pathway for the brain abnormalities observed in T2D and prodromal AD. We propose that large weight loss, which results in improvements of these modifiable vascular factors, will lead to recovery of the above mentioned central nervous system (CNS) impairments associated with T2D. We will conduct a longitudinal study comparing 100 obese individuals with T2D undergoing bariatric surgery to an equivalent group of 40 obese individuals also with T2D who will not have surgery (and likely not lose weight or improve in the modifiable vascular factors). The anticipated large changes in weight after bariatric surgery present a unique opportunity to investigate how obesity is causally related to CNS impairments. Subjects, 35-55 years old, with baseline BMI of 30-50 kg/m2 and 50% female, will be studied twice, immediately pre-surgery (baseline) and one year post-surgery, and an equal interval for the non-surgical obese T2D group. CNS recovery from injury or stroke shows large individual variability, thus we will determine how sex, education, and fitness moderate CNS recovery of the impairments associated with T2D resulting from large weight loss. We will also ascertain whether glycemic control and other modifiable vascular factors and their change over one year mediate the relationships between weight loss and recovery of the CNS impairments during that period. Both T2D and dementia are significant public health problems. This study will provide evidence to justify prevention strategies targeting modifiable vascular risk factors that likely contribute to the increased risk of dementia among individuals with T2D. By targeting modifiable vascular factors at a young age, prior to potential irreversible brain deterioration, we will show the importance of this approach among young adults, when interventions may be most effective. We will utilize reliable and validated measures so as to ensure reproducibility. The study has a strong scientific premise and has been adequately powered. Success is assured by the access to participants, an excellent environment, and the experience and productivity of the investigators."
"9524081","PROJECT SUMMARY In addition to neuronal degeneration, many Alzheimer?s disease (AD) patients suffer from vascular abnormalities and inflammation. The contact activation system may contribute to both of these pathologies since it can launch both pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory pathways. We have shown that the contact system is significantly more activated in AD patients and AD mouse models compared to control groups. The beta-amyloid peptide (A?), a driver of AD pathology, can activate Factor 12 (F12), the initiator of the contact system. We have recently shown that depletion of F12 ameliorates pathology in AD mice at early stages of disease. These results indicate that excess contact system activation may promote AD pathology and cognitive decline. There is no effective treatment for AD. A link between F12 activation and the pathogenesis of AD provides a possible novel approach to treatment. The contact system is an attractive target for AD therapy; humans deficient in F12 and mice with knockout of different contact system pathway genes have normal hemostasis. If F12 activation is indeed deleterious in AD pathology, therapies designed to block the contact system might slow disease progression while not affecting normal hemostasis. Thus, our studies may reveal new targets to suppress both thrombotic and inflammatory contributions to AD progression. Positive results might be able to be applied to AD patients rapidly as already FDA-approved drugs targeting the contact system already exist."
"9567335","Project Summary Within the past decade, electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) have become commercially available in the US, rapidly growing in popularity; 13% of adults in the US have used an e-cig and 4% are habitual ?vapers?. E-cigs are typically used for recreation or as a pathway to complete cessation. The usage of e-cigs has caused widespread debate within the public health community, mainly because there is little scientific evidence regarding their safety. On one hand, if e-cigs are safer than conventional cigarettes, they may be used as a cessation device, potentially reducing the number of smoking-related mortalities (20% of deaths in the US is linked to smoking, resulting in an estimated $500 billion in economic damage per year). However, if e-cigs usage is linked to adverse health consequences, regulatory standards must be enforced to avoid severe health impacts, especially in cigarette-naive groups. While recent efforts have been directed to uncovering potential consequences of e-cig aerosol exposure on acute pulmonary and cardiovascular function, to date minimal scientific evidence exists regarding the long-term impact of e-cig vaping on the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. To address this need, the main goal of this study is to evaluate and compare the short and long term pulmonary and cardiovascular health consequences of e-cig vaping and cigarette smoking in a well-established murine model of atherosclerosis, specifically addressing the ?Health Effects? category of the seven FDA CTP scientific interest areas. To accomplish our study objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) link dosimetry with inflammation-mediated pathological changes in the vasculature, heart, and lungs, and (2) assess the health benefits of complete smoking cessation versus switching to e-cig usage on the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. This study is significant because it will (1) combine state-of-the-art computational and experimental methodologies to determine both the cardiovascular and pulmonary health effects of e-cigs, compared to conventional cigarettes, (2) provide a correlation matrix linking predicted deposition concentrations with inflammatory response and cardiovascular and respiratory structure and function. This novel pipeline may be extended in future studies to translate findings from mouse to human. By combining our strengths and expertise in bioengineering, computational modeling, medical imaging, and cardiovascular tissue mechanics, we will provide strong quantitative measures on the health effects of e-cig usage, with the goal of providing scientific evidence for FDA regulations."
"9444500","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A gradual decline in renal function occurs in healthy aging individuals. Aging may exacerbate Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). About more than half of the CKD cases and majority of the end stage renal disease (ESRD) occur in the older population. These findings highlight the importance of kidney aging and its potential contribution to AKI, CKD and ESRD in the elderly. Since the population older than 65 years in the United States is expected to double during the next 20 years, focus on potential early intervention strategies for age-associated renal injury and disease becomes critical. We will test the hypothesis that the age-related decreases in nuclear hormone receptor FXR and G protein coupled membrane receptor TGR5 expression play an important role in age-related kidney disease by impairing mitochondrial function, which results in a) increased generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased generation of mitochondrial antioxidants, causing increased oxidative stress and inflammation, and b) decreased mitochondrial fatty acid ß-oxidation, causing increased renal lipid accumulation. We propose that FXR and/or TGR5 agonists or overexpression will prevent or markedly reduce age-related decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increase in albuminuria, podocyte loss, and accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins (fibrosis) by improving mitochondrial function, which results in a) decreased generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased generation of mitochondrial antioxidants, causing decreased oxidative stress and inflammation, and b) increased mitochondrial fatty acid ß-oxidation, causing decreased renal lipid accumulation. In SPECIFIC AIM 1, we will determine the role of FXR and TGR5 in progression of age-related renal disease. We will also perform mechanistic studies to determine how alterations in kidney bile acid composition regulate podocyte function. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, we will perform mechanistic studies to determine if FXR and TGR5 protect against age-related renal disease by Sirtuin 3 dependent mechanisms. Impact and Innovation: 1) The hitherto unrecognized roles of: i) nuclear receptor FXR, ii) G protein coupled receptor TGR5 and iii) the potential of dual FXR/TGR5 agonists as therapeutic agents for treating age- associated renal disease and complications. 2) The novel and distinct role of FXR and TGR5 agonists in regulation of mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, inflammation, and lipid metabolism, as they relate to age- associated renal conditions. 3) TGR5/FXR signaling mimics that of caloric restriction (CR), potentially leading to new intervention strategies for age-related kidney injury and complications. 4) Mechanistic studies to determine the roles of the bile acids and mitochondrial Sirtuin 3 in modulation of age-related renal disease."
"9460917","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infants exposed to impaired parenting as a result of their mothers' major depression in the perinatal period are at risk for compromised social interaction and affective and behavioral regulation. About 9% of infants less than one year have mothers who experience a major depressive episode. That rate nearly triples to 25% for infants of mothers below 200% of the federal poverty level. In addition to poverty, young maternal age, lack of social support, low education, and adverse childhood experiences are all risk factors for depression. Two strands of research point to the need for effective parenting support for mothers following treatment for their depression in pregnancy. First, depressed mothers frequently fail to accurately notice, interpret, or respond sensitively to infant cues. Alarmingly, mothers' impaired parenting of their infants continues even after their depression has been successfully treated. Second, newborns of prenatally depressed women are physiologically dysregulated and hence more challenging to nurture. With the passage of the Affordable Care Act and Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting, the federal government is supporting states to implement high-quality home visiting programs as part of a comprehensive early childhood system for vulnerable families experiencing the risk factors associated with maternal depression. But two important limitations of home visiting have been identified: child development home visitors are not trained to deal meaningfully with maternal depression, and they are often not sufficiently trained to support infant-mother relationships. Our application has the potential to inform intervention programs nationwide by testing the effectiveness of adding a short, attachment-based, home-visiting parenting program to an existing, evidence-based depression treatment program delivered via community primary care clinics serving pregnant and parenting women from vulnerable populations. The goal of this research is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Promoting First Relationships(r) for English and Spanish-speaking low-income mothers who were treated for depression beginning in pregnancy and as needed in the perinatal year. Depression treatment will be coordinated through the publicly funded, evidenced-based Mental Health Integration Program for High-Risk Pregnant and Parenting Women (MHIP Moms) in primary care community health centers that target safety-net populations in King County, Washington. Promoting First Relationships(r) is a research-based, 10-week home visiting program that uses video feedback and strengths-based consultation strategies to increase mothers' parenting competence and confidence. Bilingual community providers will deliver Promoting First Relationships(r) after a baseline assessment and random assignment at infant age three months. Post tests will occur at infant age six and twelve months. The primary specific aims are to test the effectiveness of PFR to improve parenting quality for low income, English and Spanish speaking mothers who began treatment for depression during pregnancy, and to improve social and regulatory outcomes for their infants."

"9519268","PROJECT SUMMARY Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive, life-threatening disease that often develops secondary to the chronic hypoxia of cardiopulmonary disease or high-altitude (HA) residence (? 2500m). Over the past few decades, PH-associated mortality has increased in both sexes of all race and ethnic groups, and no current therapy has proven effective for hypoxia-induced PH. Adverse intrauterine conditions, including fetal growth restriction (IUGR), preeclampsia and perinatal hypoxia, can induce durable changes to the structure and function of the lung and pulmonary vasculature, and are predictive of pulmonary vascular disease in affected offspring. Our overarching goal is to determine whether intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) increases susceptibility to hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension by altering the epigenetic regulation of genes belonging to the mTOR pathway. To address this goal, we propose to conduct three integrated scientific aims. In Aim 1, we will define the effect of IUGR on mTOR pathway DNAm and gene expression patterns, and mTOR signaling in PBMCs and two representative vascular cell types (HUAECs and HUASMCs) at birth in humans using both primary and external validation cohorts. Our primary cohort will be infants born at LA or HA in Bolivia (400 and 3600 m), and our external validation cohort will consist of infants born in Frisco, Colorado to women living ? 3000m. Obtaining samples from Bolivia for our primary data set is beneficial because the La Paz metropolitan region comprises the largest, HA resident population in the world with more than two million persons living ? 3000m and the modern medical and research facilities necessary to conduct the proposed study aims; this will improve our efficiency with respect to obtaining a sufficient number of subjects for prospective study over the proposed timeframe. In Aim 2, we will establish the relationship between mTOR DNAm and expression patterns at birth and echocardiographic indices of PH measured prospectively across the first year of life (1 week, 6 and 12 months). Because DNAm marks are influenced by environmental and genetic factors, we will also determine whether differentially methylated mTOR pathway genes in cases of IUGR and/or PH during infancy, are associated with a) SNPs neighboring (< 500 kb) differential methylation marks, or b) SNPs within genes encoding proteins known to be involved in PH. Using this approach, we will determine the interactive effect of genetic factors, epigenetic marks and IUGR for PH. In Aim 3 we will use genetic and pharmacologic approaches in an established murine model of hypoxia-induced IUGR and PH to study the interaction of DNAm state, mTOR pathway signaling and IUGR for the developmental programming of pulmonary vascular dysfunction. Together, our research aims 1) address major knowledge gaps with respect to the mechanisms underlying the effect of intrauterine exposures to compromise the pulmonary circulation and 2) have the potential to identify targets for new therapeutic or preventive strategies to reduce the burden of pulmonary vascular disease across the lifespan."

"9606742","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A major goal in neuroscience is to understand the computations performed by local brain circuits. A large obstacle to achieving this goal is that - at least in mammals - we currently cannot observe the spiking activity of most neurons within a circuit. A key reason is that standard electrodes are just too big, and provoke too much damage to brain tissue. If placed with high enough density to sample a majority of neurons, they would destroy the very circuit they are intended to monitor. Another important obstacle to understanding local brain computations is that circuit dynamics are rapidly and dramatically altered by chemical neuromodulators, which normally go unobserved. Real-time monitoring of critical modulators such as dopamine can be achieved using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, but this method has not yet been effectively combined with large-scale circuit recordings.  The proposed work would make important progress towards overcoming these obstacles, using ultra-dense arrays of 8µm carbon thread electrodes. These are stiff enough to insert deep into the brain, yet small enough to avoid a destructive immune response. By using an 80µm distance between electrodes, the great majority of neurons within a cortical layer would be within recording range. Furthermore, carbon thread electrodes are well-suited for chemical sensing using voltammetry. This proposal is to construct advanced new tools for neuroscientific investigation in a series of modular steps, culminating in 1024-channel, combined electrophysiological and electrochemical recording in freely-behaving rats.  Aim 1 involves the development and testing of silicon frameworks that allow assembly of ultra-dense arrays, together with updated headstages that allow hundreds of channels to be monitored simultaneously. Aim 2 will exploit the ability of carbon thread electrodes to be sliced in situ during histological processing. This greatly facilitates the ability to localize individual recordig sites within microcircuit architecture, and to identify individual recorded neurons. Aim 3 involves further optimization of carbon thread electrodes for chemical sensing, and joint single-unit recording and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry across many electrodes simultaneously. Overall this project combines expertise in electrical engineering, neurophysiology, and neurochemistry to create innovative, powerful devices that will be widely disseminated and may have transformational impact for our understanding of how our brains work."
"9541567","7. Project Summary/Abstract Long Term Objectives: The broad goals of this application are to (1) examine the neurophysiological markers of decision making under risk, and (2) test a theoretical model of risk attitude, neurophysiological measures of reward processing, and problematic alcohol use. The applicant?s main career objective is to develop a program of research focused on integrating decision making and neurobiological methods (e.g., psychophysiology, neuroimaging) to characterize problematic alcohol use and related risk taking behaviors. Specific Aims: The proposed project aims to (1) determine whether risk attitude is associated with a psychophysiological marker (i.e., event-related potential [ERP]) of reward processing, reward positivity (RewP) amplitude, and (2) test a model of risk attitude, RewP, and alcohol problems and expectancies. In order to complete the proposed project, the applicant will receive extensive training in psychophysiology and the broader field of neuroscience. Training will be obtained via (1) meetings with expert consultants in psychophysiology and decision making, (2) attendance at didactic workshops and conferences, and (3) coursework. Method: Data from 148 participants (aged 18-29) will be collected using self-report questionnaires, behavioral tasks, and electroencephalography (EEG). While EEG is recorded, participants will complete a decision making task that will allow for the neural correlates of decision making under risk to be examined. Another task measuring neural response to reward versus loss will also be administered while EEG is recorded. The associations of these psychophysiological markers with behavioral data from the decision making task, self- report measures of alcohol problems, and other related variables will be examined. Significance: The applicant aims to take advantage of the methodological strengths of neuroeconomics and the theoretical strengths of judgment and decision making models to better understand the neural correlates of decision making processes associated with alcohol-related risk taking. This study will allow for examination of how neural markers of reward processing differ as a function of risk attitude and the characteristics of the choice being made, consistent with the individualized, neurobiologically based assessment promoted by the RDoC framework. Results from this project will allow for improved characterization of individuals at risk for problematic alcohol use and may ultimately inform prevention efforts among young adults."
"9473658","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central goal of this project is to identify and characterize small molecule inhibitors of Ubiquitin specific peptidase 51 (USP51), a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme exclusive to sperm, as a means to develop a reversible, non-hormonal male contraceptive. The ubiquitin system is fundamental to ensure protein turnover within mammalian cells. Ubiquitin-activating enzymes, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and ubiquitin protein ligases catalyze the attachment of ubiquitin molecules to proteins, a process that targets them to the proteasome for degradation. DUBs catalyze the removal of ubiquitin to facilitate their recycling. We have identified USP51 to be specifically expressed in late elongating spermatids and epididymal sperm. USP51 depletion in mice using Vivo-Morpholinos results in male infertility due to a complete block of sperm motility.  Our overall hypothesis is tat USP51 is a viable contraceptive target and that small molecules existing in nature or modified in the laboratory will effectively and reversibly inhibit USP51 function in epididymal sperm. We will pursue the following Specific Aims to address this hypothesis: 1) Validate the targeting of USP51 as an effective strategy for contraceptive development. 2) Screen small molecule libraries in silico and in vitro to identify hit compounds. 3) Perform hit-to-lead medicinal chemistry optimization and assess the exposure of sperm, testes and animals to candidates for efficacy and reversibility. These studies will advance our basic understanding of spermatogenesis and sperm function, as well as provide the potential for developing new contraceptive agents that reversibly inhibit a critical sperm enzyme."

The candidate's midcareer training goals are to enhance knowledge and skills in mobile technology and social network analyses, establish a transdisciplinary mentorship program in mHealth research targeting CVD risk reduction, assist mentees to become independent investigators, and ultimately, to contribute to the scientific workforce focused on mHealth solutions for CVD prevention. The overarching goal of the research plan is to test ways to leverage mobile technologies and online social networks to increase the impact, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and dissemination potential of behavioral interventions. Three research aims are proposed, all of which examine the feasibility of novel technology-driven ways to deliver behavior change strategies. The first aim proposes to develop and test the proof-of-concept of a mobile app that will use sensing technology to identify physiological and environmental triggers for overeating. Findings will inform an app designed to identify key moments users would benefit from behavioral support. The second aim is to develop and test the proof-of-concept of a weight loss mobile app that contains an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. The third aim is t test the feasibility of a lifestyle intervention that is delivered via an online social network. Al of the proposed interventions were designed to minimize or eliminate patient visits. This work will provide preliminary data for 3 trials testing the efficacy of these interventions in patient care settings. Identifying cost-effective and scalable means to treat obesity is a public health priorit given the spiraling healthcare costs associated with obesity. The proposed work will produce data toward that end and contribute to the mentorship of the next generation of researchers who will have transdisciplinary expertise to capitalize on mobile technologies in the prevention of CVD."

"9461957","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is intimately associated with obesity, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Traditionally, NAFLD has been associated with caloric excess on a susceptible genetic background, however recent studies from our laboratory and others have pointed out a role for environmental toxicants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), in the etiology of steatosis and steatohepatitis, particularly in the context of hypercaloric diet coexposure. Our proposed study uses exposure parameters informed by our recent analysis of serum samples from a previously-described cohort of individuals residing in Anniston, AL who were exposed to high levels of PCB-containing waste. Although many of these individuals have serum levels of PCBs above that found in the general population of the US, their exposures remain well below the levels implicated in acute liver injury. Nevertheless, these individuals have significantly elevated biomarkers of liver injury as well as elevated inflammatory cytokines, elevated prevalence of diabetes, and increased BMI when compared to an unexposed population. A frustrating finding of previous toxicity studies has been the very different pathological response of mice and humans to such subacute, chronic, and environmentally relevant PCB exposures. Our preliminary data in a mouse model of subacute PCB exposure shows paradoxical elevations of liver injury biomarkers, fatty change, and inflammatory cytokines at lower exposure vs. higher exposure to a PCB mixture (20mg Aroclor 1260/kg body weight vs. 200mg/kg body weight Aroclor 1260). In two knockout mouse models that lack the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) or the pregnane and xenobiotic receptor (PXR), our laboratory has found differential transcription of the gene targets of these receptors in response to Aroclor 1260 and high-fat diet exposure. These patterns of pathological and phenotypic responses are consistent with a transcription-factor based mechanism of PCB toxicity. The differences in disease endpoints may therefore be due to differences in ligand specificity and target gene cohort between the human and mouse forms of these receptors. We therefore propose to expand our investigation of receptor-based mechanisms of PCB toxicity with the use of a novel triple-transgenic mouse model expressing human forms of AhR, PXR, and CAR. We hypothesize that using both an acute-exposure primary hepatocyte culture, and a whole animal chronic exposure model, we will find that differences in the structure and function of these receptors will drive a differential transcriptioal response to PCBs and ultimately, differences in PCB-associated disease endpoints."
"9480704","PROJECT SUMMARY Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-organ rheumatologic disease characterized by immune dysregulation and a heterogeneous disease course, with heightened disease severity in pediatric patients. Conventional clinical and laboratory parameters are not sufficiently sensitive or specific for detecting ongoing disease activity or response to specific immunomodulators, underscoring a need to better delineate the underlying immune changes that drive unpredictable flare-ups of disease activity. The lack of knowledge regarding the precise immune cellular and molecular events leading to SLE disease poses a significant hurdle in the effort to develop accurate prognostic disease biomarkers and selective therapeutic agents. Our long- term goal is to identify immune cellular and molecular mediators that could provide targets for therapeutic intervention. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which serum-circulating factors including exosomes modulate immune cellular and cytokine derangements in pediatric SLE pathogenesis. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding these mechanisms could identify novel disease biomarkers that permit accurate prognosis and provide selective therapeutic targets. To achieve this goal, Dr. Hsieh will use a high-dimensional mass cytometry platform, which offers single-cell analysis of over 40 parameters, utilizing rare earth metal isotopes instead of fluorophores as tags bound to antibodies. In a pilot study, Dr. Hsieh established a quantitative and reproducible mass cytometry assay that allows precise monitoring of phenotypic (surface markers) and functional (cytokines/chemokines) immune derangements detectable in peripheral blood of pediatric SLE patients. The data from this study form the basis of Dr. Hsieh's central hypothesis that pediatric SLE patients share a unique multi-parametric monocyte cytokine signature, which drives disease activity and is propagated by serum factors (including exosomes) through activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the association of the cytokine signature (and other immune changes) with SLE disease activity, by integrating mass cytometry immune profile data and clinical parameters from a prospective longitudinal pediatric SLE patient cohort; 2) Elucidate immunomodulatory properties of SLE serum-isolated exosomes, by evaluating the ability of diseased serum exosomes to induce the cytokine signature, and identifying exosome proteomic components essential for such activity; and 3) Determine the capacity of ruxolitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor) to abrogate expression of the cytokine signature, by evaluating ex vivo immunosuppressive effects (including off-target effects) of ruxolitinib on immune derangements observed in pediatric SLE pathogenesis. Dr. Hsieh is an Assistant Professor at the University of Colorado Denver/Children's Hospital Colorado in the Departments of Immunology and Microbiology, and Pediatrics. As a clinical fellow, she trained in Dr. Garry Nolan's laboratory (Stanford), acknowledged as world-class in the application of mass cytometry to single-cell analysis, where she acquired expertise in this technology. Dr. Hsieh has assembled a mentoring team composed of a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in basic science immunology, particularly immune signaling alterations in autoimmunity; clinical study design and implementation; exosome biology; and biostatistics. Her primary mentor Dr. John Cambier and co-mentor Dr. V. Michael Holers are well- established scientists with collaborations focused on autoimmune disorders and the immune system. Their extensive experience with trainees will be complemented by the expertise of her scientific advisory committee, co-mentor Dr. Michael Graner, internationally known expert in the field of exosome biology, advisors/collaborators Dr. Jennifer Soep, pediatric rheumatologist with a clinical research focus on SLE, and Dr. Debashis Ghosh, Chairman of Biostatistics with expertise on high-throughput data analysis. Collectively, this team will provide an outstanding training environment that will fill critical gaps in her toolbox and knowledge base to enhance her ability to study immune derangements in pediatric SLE patients. Dr. Hsieh has created a career development plan that will prepare her for successful transition to independence, incorporating didactic and mentored training in: 1) basic science immunology; 2) clinical study design and implementation; 3) exosome biology; and 4) biostatistics and computational biology. The proposed approach is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it departs from the status quo by elucidating specific mechanisms underlying inflammatory perturbations in SLE (e.g., serum exosome-mediated immune modulation) and by characterizing these mechanisms as they occur in the context of multiple immune cell phenotypes, intracellular cytokine networks, and remitting/relapsing disease activity, with single-cell level resolution. The proposed research is significant because it will likely identify candidate disease biomarkers for prognostic and therapeutic purposes in SLE, and will likely delineate novel therapeutic targets derived from serum exosomes and their proteomic components. The knowledge gained will have broad translational importance through application of this systems immunology approach to other systemic rheumatologic disorders."
"9494292","NIH investigators are gathering terabyte- to petabyte-scale datasets generated using state-of-the-art biomedical technologies. To properly manage these large datasets, researchers need to keep them secure from unauthorized access and from data loss, while still being able to share the data with collaborators, and maintain these best practices over long periods of time. Although Stanford investigators have access to petabyte-scale High Performance Storage (HPS) systems, these systems are designed for high performance computation and not long-term protected storage, and they do not have granular secure file sharing. We request funding for a storage appliance known as an object store that will provide a robust mechanism for long-term protected data storage and secure data sharing. Additionally, our proposed storage appliance will be usable by multiple researchers simultaneously and be simple for users and administrators to manage. ?Need for data sharing?: Data sharing is essential for expedited translation of research results into knowledge, products, and procedures to improve human health, so researchers are under pressure from a variety of institutions to make their data available. This appliance will enable investigators to put up a lightweight webpage for data-sharing (e.g., laboratory website, wiki, or github) while storing the bulk of the data on this appliance. ?Need for data security?: Raw biomedical data are often shared with strict security and privacy requirements. Our proposed appliance supports file access management by supporting authentication, authorization, and access controls with Stanford?s user database. Its fine-grained approach to authentication will allow files to be shared with limited sets of users, which is valuable when exchanging data with collaborators. ?Need for data protection?: The traditional RAID scheme for data protection used by HPS systems to provide high throughput is not resilient enough for long-term data protection in the age of high capacity disks (8TB/hard drive). Our proposed object storage uses an erasure-coding scheme, a method that provides better availability at lower overhead and cost when compared with RAID. An appliance like this object store will make a fundamental impact to 100s of researchers at Stanford by providing them with a flexible and cost-effective resource for long-term protected data storage and secure file sharing."
"9545269","PROJECT SUMMARY  Cardiovascular disease and susceptibility to infection are two leading causes of morbidity and mortality for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). One of the major contributors to SCI-associated cardiovascular disease and immune deficiency is the syndrome autonomic dysreflexia (AD), an amplified reaction of the autonomic nervous system in response to sensory stimuli below the injury that manifests in 70%-90% of people who have sustained a high SCI. AD is hallmarked by extreme, sudden bouts of hypertension and reflexive bradycardia (i.e. heart rate decrease). Over time, AD events become more severe. These chronic, frequent episodes of hypertension are thought to lead to peripheral vascular dysfunction and immune suppression that contribute to cardiovascular disease and susceptibility to infection, respectively. Merely limiting AD intensity may have significant therapeutic value and improve SCI patients' overall health. The gradual exacerbation of AD is thought to be driven by plasticity of circuits below the lesion that results in an exaggerated spinal sympathetic reflex. Unfortunately, the mechanisms that trigger this maladaptive plasticity are still poorly understood, limiting the development of prophylactic treatments. Interestingly, an activated neuroimmune system is thought to be an underlying factor in aberrant plasticity and hyperexcitable circuits correlated with other pathologies. The pro-inflammatory, soluble form of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor ? (sTNF?) has been implicated in initiating inflammation in many contexts. Furthermore, sTNF? is associated with various forms of plasticity that could increase neuronal excitability. We hypothesize that sTNF? in spinal cord below a SCI plays a crucial role in triggering aberrant plasticity that leads to hyperactivity of the spinal sympathetic circuit after SCI and the secondary, intensification phase of AD. Moreover, this proposal will focus on the hypothesis that sTNFa/TNFR1 signaling in neurons involved in the circuit is central to the exacerbation. We will test our hypotheses using an established adult rodent spinal cord thoracic level 3 transection model that reliably results in AD. The overall goals of this multi-PI proposal are to: 1) further interrogate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting sTNF? to reduce AD (Aim 1); 2) investigate the mechanisms underlying how neuronal sTNF?/TNFR1 mediates AD (Aims 2 and 3)."

Interestingly, knocking out the HIF-1 repressor vhl-1 significantly increases lifespan in worms, but causes a disease (von Hippel Lindau disease) in humans. My research focuses on how HIF-1 stabilization positively affects longevity in worms, studying the associated tissues and downstream factors necessary for lifespan effects and separating them from those that cause disease in people. Since stress response pathways like HIF-1 are highly conserved, it is likely that at least some of the downstream effectors in worms will be present in mammals. In characterizing these downstream genes, I will use biochemical techniques including a novel approach to measure covalent changes made to HIF-1. The development of this approach will answer questions about how HIF-1 is regulated and provide a blueprint for similar studies in HIF-1 and other stress-response proteins in worms and other organisms. At the conclusion of the described experiments, I will show that HIF-1 stabilization in a known set of cells can increase worm healthspan and longevity by activating specific proteins in specific cells. I will characterize the function of these proteins and whether they lie downstream of any other aging interventions. In doing this, I will develop a protocol to measure HIF-1 post-translational modifications in response to a known transcriptional repressor, and plan to expand these experiments in future studies. Thus, these studies will be important for defining the role of stress response pathways in longevity. This transitional award will encompass the final two years of my postdoctoral research and the first three years of my independent, faculty training. During the mentored stage of the proposal, I will define the tissues and learn the techniques to characterize the downstream proteins necessary for HIF-1-mediated longevity, including developing the methodology for measuring its post-translational modifications. After transitioning to independence, I will more fully characterize the HIF-1 signaling pathway and its downstream proteins with a focus on eventually transitioning the work into mammalian models. As a transitional award, this proposal also focuses on many aspects of career development. Both the mentored and independent portions of the proposal emphasize training in the classroom and in the laboratory while continuing to write and review papers and grant applications. In summary, this project will help define how the hypoxic response pathway could improve healthspan and lifespan in mammals while also providing opportunities for training during the mentored stage, separating and distinguishing my work from that of my mentor, and developing a new experimental protocol."
"9523887","Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world?s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans.1 Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, ?Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,? Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers. !"
"9564040","Drug development in Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires a considerable investment of time and re- sources, often with little reward as the vast majority of medications ultimately prove unsuccessful. Drug repur- posing, in which medications that already have been approved for treatment are evaluated for therapeutic effects in other disorders, has the potential to markedly increase the number of agents in the drug development pipeline but requires methods for effective screening of candidate medications for activity. In silico or computational ap- proaches to medication screening are rapidly growing, and have been successful in illnesses such as cancer, but their application to AD remains understudied. There is also intense interest in drug repurposing approaches that will utilize the vast amounts of clinical data that are being collected from epidemiological studies and clinical encounters documented through electronic health records (EHRs). In this proposal, we present a novel approach to drug repurposing that uses large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms applied to concurrent medication taken by participants in AD clinical trials and in Medicare administrative data to determine which of these medications show potential therapeutic bene?ts. With over 30 years of AD clinical trial data available to us through a recently developed meta-database and 10 years of prescription data available through Medicare Part D, the administration of concurrent medications to patients as part of their routine clinical care constitutes a large- scale natural experiment. This information can be harnessed for AD treatment discovery if appropriate methods can be developed to detect effects on disease progression within this high-dimensional data. Data mining al- gorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale screening for drug repurposing. Using our meta-database and Medicare data, we will be able to evaluate most of the more than 6,000 currently available prescription medications for ef?cacy in AD using well-accepted endpoints for measuring disease progression. The discovery phase will be followed by a validation phase of promising candidate medications in independent data sets, as well as identi?cation of plausible gene targets for each medication from the biomedical literature. This study will set the groundwork for a series of follow-up in vivo studies to conclusively demonstrate effects of selected medications for AD, expanding the current armamentarium for treating this common and debilitating disorder."
"9520127","PROJECT 6: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The inorganic metalloid arsenic, organic chlorinated solvents (e. g. trichloroethene (TCE)) and aromatic hydrocarbons (e. g. benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX)) are frequently detected as a mixture of contaminants in groundwater aquifers. Their presence in drinking water supplies represents a hazard to public health and the environment. Currently, arsenic ranks No.1 on the ATSDR Priority List of Hazardous Substances and has been reported as a problem at 917 Superfund National Priorities List sites. Due to its common co-occurrence with TCE and BTEX at these sites, it is important to understand the effects of potential remediation strategies that target only one contaminant class on the fate and transport of the other contaminants. The objective of this project is to apply systems biology approaches to study interactions within microbial communities involved in the bioremediation of groundwater mixtures containing arsenic species in combination with TCE and BTEX. We aim to enrich and study microbial communities that can concurrently reduce the bioavailability of arsenic and degrade the co-contaminants and specifically address complex problems arising from the presence of chemical mixtures at hazardous waste sites. Bioremediation processes that biostimulate fermenting microorganisms by injection of organics into groundwater aquifers to promote the dechlorination of TCE are likely to generate soluble arsenic species, leading to the production of new and more significant groundwater (GW) contaminants. Similarly, BTEX releases into aquifers result in the rapid depletion of oxygen and other electron acceptors, leading to arsenic mobilization. A key challenge in achieving effective bioremediation without mobilizing arsenic is understanding the multi-scale complexity of subsurface microbial communities that could facilitate useful transformations of arsenic, while also targeting the degradation of organic co-contaminants. We hypothesize that understanding the structure, function and syntrophic interactions of microbial communities involved in arsenic transformations can lead to optimized simultaneous bioremediation of the metalloid arsenic as well as chlorinated solvents and aromatic hydrocarbons. To test this hypothesis, we will enrich and construct cultures as well as co-contaminant transformations and apply meta-omics based approaches to characterize interactions within these communities. We will then evaluate the responses of these enrichments and consortia to perturbations and various co-contaminant exposures (aims 1-3). We will subsequently develop models to provide predictive input to new designs for effective bioremediation of these mixtures (aim 4). from contaminated GW and sediments that are capable of arsenic cycling The knowledge and models developed from this research will be valuable to provide guidance to practitioners of bioremediation to improve operation and practice in the common occurrence of co-located mixtures of arsenic, solvents and aromatics."
"9553142","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application, Feelings and Body Investigators (FBI): Interoceptive Exposure for Child Abdominal Pain is in response to PA-11-177, Translational Research for the Development of Novel Interventions for Mental Disorders (R21/R33). We propose development and pilot-testing of an acceptance- based behavioral treatment for young children (5-8 years old) with functional abdominal pain (FAP; R21, n=26, R33, n=100). FAP is one of the most frequent somatic syndromes in young children, causes significant impairment, and is predictive of psychiatric and pain disorders later in childhood and in adulthood. No treatments exist for very young children with FAP. Research supports that FAP is influenced by: (1) early pain on the neurodevelopment of the gut-brain axis and (2) maladaptive interactions with the social environment that inadvertently increase somatic fear. These vulnerabilities provide targets for early intervention. OBJECTIVE: To develop and pilot an intervention for FAP based on fundamental neuroscience research on the aberrant neurodevelopment of the gut-brain axis and subsequent modification by the social environment. Our treatment 1) links intervention strategies to unique patterns of neural circuit maturation associated with early visceral pain on the gut-brain axis, 2) adapts acceptance-based behavioral strategies used to address psychopathology in older children to younger children, and 3) incorporates caregivers as role models and facilitators based on attachment research. METHODS: Our ten session intervention trains children to be Feeling and Body Investigators. Half of the sessions will be done in clinic and half at home via web-camera to facilitate generalization. During the treatment child/caregiver dyads will 1) gather body clues (Learn), 2) investigate (Experience: perform interoceptive mystery missions to explore a body sensation), 3) organize body clues (Contextualize: recall other contexts that evoke similar sensations), and 4) go on increasingly daring missions (Challenge: decrease avoidance and safety behaviors). In the R21 phase we will develop and refine the FBI intervention in 26 child- caregiver dyads. In the R33 phase we will randomize 100 children with FAP to FBI or an active control (parent education with standard medical care) to conduct a pilot-test of the feasibility, acceptability, an clinical significance of FBI compared with an active control treatment. We will use epidemiological methods to screen all eligible children attending primary care practices so that our sample will be representative of young children with FAP, not simply a convenience sample. If we are successful, young children with FAP who complete our FBI early intervention will learn to experience changes in the viscera as fun and fascinating, rather than scary, and will develop new capacities for pain management, adaptive functioning, and emotion regulation. The success of our early intervention for FAP in young children will also have broad implications for the treatment and prevention of mental illness and chronic abdominal pain."
"9459323","Abstract A cure for osteoarthritis (OA) remains elusive. This is due in large part to two major obstacles, inability to detect OA sufficiently early before the onset of irreversible signs and recalcitrant symptoms, and inability to identify individuals at high risk of progression based on traditionally used metrics (age, sex, body mass index, knee pain and joint space width). The latter challenge is responsible for low powering of clinical trials and numerous drug trial failures. Using a systematic, unbiased and iterative approach, we have created a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomic panel for serum-based prediction of knee OA structural progression and diagnosis of knee OA. The selection of proteins was based on results of extensive discovery proteomic studies in synovial fluid, urine, and serum from knee OA radiographic progressors and non-progressors (with 3-4 year follow-up) and controls. The ultimate goals of this work are to qualify these new biomarker candidates in the contexts of knee OA progression and OA diagnosis in larger well-phenotyped cohorts from the Osteoarthritis Initiative, the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project and the Chingford cohorts. With this further qualification, these new biomarker tools will be very significant for their potential utility for clinical trial and clinical use to inform strategies for phenotyping and earlier identification and treatment of OA patients. We also intend to pursue formal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) qualification of the optimal marker set yielded by this proposal to facilitate their use as drug development tools."
"9640795","?    DESCRIPTION:  The brain is made up of many different types of neurons. For example, one class of neuron in the striatum is called the medium spiny neuron (MSN). These spiny neurons are so called because they contain dendritic spines that form connections, called synapses, with glutamate-containing axons from the cortex and dopamine containing axons from the substantia nigra. The dendritic spines on the MSNs contain signaling and scaffolding molecules in an electron dense area called the postsynaptic density. Psychostimulant drugs of abuse act to increase dopamine release from nigral dopaminergic neurons, which has downstream effects on proteins that are localized to MSN dendritic spines. One protein, spinophilin, is increased upon chronic exposure to psychostimulant drugs of abuse. Striatal MSNs can be subdivided into two classes, direct and indirect pathway neurons. Currently there are very few ways to evaluate the function of synaptic proteins in the different classes of MSNs. This is important because the two classes of MSNs have different responses to psychostimulant exposure. The goal of our proposal is to determine the function of spinophilin in the two classes of MSNs in regulating responses to chronic non-toxic and toxic regimens of psychomotor stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines. Determining the cell-specific role of spinophilin in mediating pathologies associated with these drugs of abuse will identify new pathways that can be targeted for treatment of addiction and disorders associated with long-term methamphetamine abuse, such as Parkinson disease (PD). In this proposal, we hypothesize that spinophilin plays a unique role in the two MSN populations in mediating psychostimulant-induced pathologies. This hypothesis will be tested using the following specific aims:  Aim 1. (R21). Generate and validate mouse lines expressing tamoxifen-inducible, iCre in direct and indirect pathway MSNs. We will generate mouse lines that express a tamoxifen-inducible, improved Cre (iCre) recombinase in direct or indirect pathway MSNs.  Aim 2. (R21). Generate and validate floxed spinophilin (Spinofl/fl) mice. We will generate a novel transgenic mouse line that will be crossed with the iCre animals generated in aim 1 to create MSN-specific spinophilin KO animals.  Aim 3. (R33). Determine the role of spinophilin in direct and indirect pathway MSNs on psychostimulant sensitization. We will use mice created in aims 1 and 2 to determine the function of spinophilin in the two MSN populations on the regulation of pathologies associated with psychostimulant-induced sensitization Aim 4. (R33). Determine the role of spinophilin in direct and indirect pathway MSNs on METH toxicity. We will use mice created in aims 1 and 2 to determine the function of spinophilin in the two MSN populations on the regulation of pathologies associated with methamphetamine-induced toxicity."
"9524119","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop new control systems to restore seated function and enhance the postural stability of the trunk for individuals paralyzed by spinal cord injury (SCI). Systems that provide persons with the ability to sit erect, alter their seated posture, and maintain balance by automatically adjusting stimulation to the paralyzed muscles will be designed, optimized in simulation, and evaluated experimentally in nine volunteers with SCI. The project will result in a unique, comprehensive trunk balance control system that extends the capabilities and improves the safety of all currently available trunk neuroprostheses.  The first aim of the study is to design, deploy and test an advanced neuroprosthesis to stabilize the trunks of individuals with SCI and maintain upright sitting. A disturbance-rejection controller using information from body-mounted sensors will be optimized to maintain erect posture for disturbances in all directions around the seated user. In that way restrictive chest straps or custom seating adaptations are completely eliminated and the likelihood of falling from the wheelchair reduced to a minimum.  The objective of the second aim is to tune, characterize and asses the performance of a system that will allow individuals with paraplegia to safely deploy their trunks and maintain the stability of non-erect postures, thus expanding their reachable workspace. Performance of this posture-changing controller will be determined in a series of experiments that deploy the trunk to different positions away from the backrest and testing the ability to remain steady at the desired postures.  In the third aim, we will characterize the consistency, accuracy and fidelity of the implanted sensors in the new networked neuroprosthesis (NNPS). This will be done by collecting data in a series of experiments and developing an algorithm that will fuse the signals from the various sensors to produce a robust feedback signal suitable for control studies. Thereafter we will implement the disturbance-rejection and posture-changing control systems without external components with this new technology.  This application addresses the main mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to help lead the way toward important medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. In particular it coincides with the missions of NINDS to reduce the burden of neurological disease, NIBIB to improve health by leading the development and accelerating the application of biomedical technologies, and NCMRR to foster development of scientific knowledge needed to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality-of-life of people with disabilities."
"9635159","Project Summary: I aim to establish a biomedical research lab that investigates mechanisms of placental development and pathophysiology. Dr. Alan Guttmacher recently identified the placenta as ?the least understood human organ? when discussing the Human Placenta Project, a new initiative of the National Institute of Childhood Health and Human Development (Kaiser J. 2014. Science 344(6188):1073). Placental dysfunction and resulting syndromes are poorly understood despite the clear significance to human health. Impaired placental function can lead to fetal growth restriction and is linked to preeclampsia, a pregnancy specific life-threatening hypertensive syndrome within unknown etiology. Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal death. It occurs in 3-8% of pregnancies, and ~4% of these cases result in mortality. Other cases lead to premature birth, developmental disorders in offspring, increased risk for cardiovascular and kidney diseases later in life for mothers, and substantial health care costs. Unfortunately, the number of preeclampsia cases is increasing. Stephen Hodgins, Deputy-in-Chief of Global Health: Science and Practice, recently published an editorial titled ?Pre-eclampsia as an Underlying Cause for Perinatal Deaths: Time for Action? (Hodgins S. 2015. GHSP; 3(4):525-527), highlighting this important global public health issue. A better understanding of the placenta is greatly needed in order to diagnose, treat, and prevent preeclampsia and other health issues resulting from placental dysfunction. My work will address several key unknowns in placental development and pathophysiology. I will begin by determining molecular mechanisms of maternal-fetal phosphate transport. Phosphorus is an essential nutrient and it is required for several processes in growth and development, such as DNA and cell membrane structure, bone deposition, oxidative phosphorylation, and others. Remarkably, the molecular mechanisms and proteins that regulate maternal-fetal phosphate transport remain unknown. I have identified a likely family of maternal-fetal phosphate transporters and developed loss of function mouse models that revealed specific developmental requirements. PiT-1 loss results in embryonic lethality, decreased endocytosis, and impaired angiogenesis (Wallingford et al. 2014. Mech. Dev. 133:189-202). PiT-2 deficiency results in fetal growth restriction, decreased bone density, and abundant placental calcification (Wallingford et al. Reprod. Biol. and Wallingford et al. Brain Pathology ? both in process). The PiT-2 null mouse is the first and only placental calcification model available. My data suggests that PiT-2 mediated anti-calcific mechanisms may play a key role in preventing placental dysfunction, and clinical studies have indeed correlated altered expression levels of PiT-1 and PiT-2 with preeclampsia (Yang et al. 2014. Mol. Reprod. & Dev. 81:851-860). Further, calcification of the placenta is frequently observed in humans, and I have identified distinct types of placental calcification that vary between pregnancy types. I have developed models of how loss or dysfunction of Slc20a1 and Slc20a2 could lead to preeclampsia; here I propose aims that will test these models in mouse and human and provide fundamental mechanistic insights into phosphate transporter biology and placental pathophysiology. As a postdoctoral trainee during the mentored (K99) phase of the research program, I will build upon my preliminary data and obtain the training necessary to test the hypothesis that placental dysfunction and preeclampsia can be caused by dysregulated phosphate metabolism that disrupts placental development and function, and promotes the deposition of placental calcification. I will test my prosed models of Slc20a1 and Slc20a2 yolk sac and placental phosphate transport, and publish these findings during the K99 phase. After I have transitioned into the independent (R00) phase, I will continue to investigate molecular mechanisms of Slc20a1 and Slc20a2 function. I will also test hypotheses aimed at determining how loss of Slc20a1 and Slc20a2 could lead to placental dysfunction, how calcification impacts placental function, and whether candidate pro-calcific markers are diagnostic tools for placental calcification-associated preeclampsia.   "

"9561467","ABSTRACT Among men who have sex with men (MSM) testing for HIV in the United States (US), approximately 60% of all incident HIV infections occur in men reporting the highest quartile of risk behaviors. Young MSM (i.e. those ?24 years of age; hereafter ?YMSM?) are disproportionately represented in the highest risk quartile, have rates of HIV incidence twice as high as older MSM, and are less likely to take preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the prevention of HIV. As a high-impact prevention strategy, the CDC recommends YMSM test for HIV once every 3-6 months. Alarmingly, we recently documented risk behaviors increased in direct proportion to the number of repeat negative HIV tests among MSM, despite routine risk-reduction counseling. The dynamics behind increasing risk behaviors in repeat testers are poorly understood. Increased risk behavior may lead to more frequent (and appropriate) HIV testing or perhaps more frequent HIV testing gives rise to increased risk behavior (i.e., negative test results may be interpreted as positive reinforcement that ongoing risk behaviors are not sufficiently risky to result in HIV infection). In either case, current public health efforts to increase HIV- testing in the highest risk quartile are likely to capture more YMSM, and studies are needed to delineate the drivers of ongoing or increased risk behavior in YMSM after testing to develop more effective interventions to promote HIV prevention. Given the push to increase repeat HIV testing among YMSM in the US, gaining a better understanding of if and how repeat testing influences risk perception and risk behavior is critical. We propose a novel study to assess perceptions of receiving negative HIV test results and how they are associated with HIV risk and prevention behaviors over time in YMSM. To explore the attributions and ?meaning? YMSM make of negative HIV test results over time, we will perform cross-sectional in-depth qualitative interviews (n=20; phase 1) in PrEP-naïve HIV repeat testers receiving negative HIV test results, followed by quantitative assessment and monitoring of patterns of self-reported risk behaviors and perceived risk over time (n=115; phase 2) in YMSM. Purposive sampling for the qualitative interviews will stratify recruitment by self-reported risk behavior at their two most recent testing encounters. Qualitative findings will be incorporated into a validated questionnaire that quantitatively measures psychological reactions to the receipt of negative HIV test results. In phase 2 of the study, the adapted questionnaire will then be delivered together with monthly microsurveys to assess development of self-reported risk and prevention behaviors, as well as perceptions of HIV-exposure risk before receiving the negative HIV test result and over 12-months after the testing encounter. The proposed study will inform strategies to modify or develop prevention interventions delivered during repeat HIV testing and counseling sessions."
"9452971","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the major cause of visual impairment and blindness in persons > 65 years in the United States and the 3rd leading cause of blindness worldwide. Several lines of evidence have implicated immune activation and inflammation in the pathogenesis of AMD, including biomarkers of systemic inflammation as risk factors for AMD, complement deposition in drusen, complement factor and chemokine genetic polymorphisms as risk factors for AMD, and circulating activated monocytes in patients with AMD. Antiretroviral (ART) -treated, immunorestored, HIV-infected patients have accelerated/accentuated aging and a shortened life span due to age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes. Immunorestored, HIV-infected persons have immune system changes similar to those of >70 year-old HIV- uninfected persons, known as immunosenescence. Enrollment data from the Longitudinal Study of the Ocular Complications of AIDS (LSOCA) cohort show a ~4-fold greater prevalence (prevalence ~10%) of intermediate- stage AMD vs. that seen in an age-matched, HIV-uninfected cohort. LSOCA has enrolled 2092 participants with AIDS, has medical and treatment data, cryopreserved plasma and blood leukocyte specimens in a specimen repository from enrollment and every-6-month follow-up visits, and has an archive of 5- and 10-year follow-up retinal photographs, which will be graded at a Reading Center for incident AMD. Cryopreserved blood specimens will be evaluated for evidence of inflammation, immune (particularly monocyte) activation, and immunosenescence markers as risk factors for both prevalent and incident AMD, using a nested case-control design. Pathways and markers will be those known to be operative in both ART-treated, HIV infected persons, and in HIV-uninfected older persons. Biomarkers and pathways identified as relevant to AMD in the LSOCA cohort will be evaluated in cryopreserved specimens from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) cohort. These studies will lead to an improved understanding of the roles of inflammation, immune activation, and immunosenescence in the pathogenesis of AMD."
"9512540","Pain is a multidimensional experience with sensory and affective components. The aversive quality of pain (i.e. pain aversion/unpleasantness) causes the majority of chronic pain patients' suffering, and often results in comorbid disorders (anxiety/depression). However, the mechanisms by which our brain assigns a negative emotional valence to nociceptive information to generate pain aversion remain unresolved. This gap in knowledge prevents targeting pain aversion mechanisms to restore the wellbeing of chronic pain patients. Nociceptive information only acquires its aversive quality once processed through emotional valence circuits. Several cortical and limbic structures contribute to this process, including the anterior cingulate/prefrontal/insular cortices, and the amygdala. We obtained preliminary data in mice suggesting that pain aversion is encoded in neural activity patterns in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). First, we found that BLA activity patterns evolve during chronic neuropathic pain, so that innocuous stimuli such as light touch and cold aberrantly engage BLA nociceptive neural ensembles. This result suggests that the BLA miscodes somatosensory information, possibly explaining how these innocuous stimuli become painful (i.e. aversive) during chronic pain. Second, inhibition of tagged nociceptive BLA neurons with chemogenetics did not alter paw withdrawal from noxious stimuli, but nearly eliminated pain affective-motivational behaviors and avoidance of noxious stimuli. This finding suggests that painful stimuli are detected, but are no longer perceived as aversive. Building on these preliminary data, we propose to elucidate the mechanisms that shape pain aversion in the BLA. Fluorescent microendoscopy of calcium dynamics in freely moving mice experiencing pain will determine how noxious stimuli are encoded in BLA valence neural ensembles, acutely and during chronic pain (Aim 1). Viral tracing and chemogenetic/optogenetic inhibition of specific BLA neuron inputs will uncover the circuits that generate pain aversion (Aim 2). Finally, multilabeling in situ hybridization and slice electrophysiology studies will identify the transmitters and synaptic mechanisms that regulate activity of BLA neurons, and the pathological alterations associated with the emergence of chronic pain (Aim 3). This research will transform our understanding of pain neurobiology by dissecting the mechanisms underlying pain affect and, in the long-term, will uncover new approaches to treat chronic pain by weakening the associated aversion and preventing comorbid psychological disorders, such as anxiety and depression."
"9459322","SUMMARY  One of the most common problems in clinical orthopaedics continues to be ?aseptic loosening? due to inflammatory osteolysis. Wear particles from the implants stimulate macrophages to produce inflammatory cytokines, which induce local osteolysis and inhibit osteogenic repair of the osteolysis. Our long-term goal is to discover novel underlying mechanisms and thereby identify novel therapeutic targets for patients with ?aseptic loosening?. This R21 A1 application will test the overall hypothesis that extracellular ATP (eATP) increases the biologic activity of orthopaedic wear particles.  Consistent with the overall hypothesis, our preliminary results indicate that wear particles stimulate macrophages to release ATP. eATP is the only known ligand for P2X7R, which is the primary macrophage receptor for elevated levels of eATP. Stimulation of P2X7R by eATP increases some types of inflammation but has not previously been studied in ?aseptic loosening?. Aim 1 (proof-of-principle aim) will therefore determine how eATP and P2X7R affect the biologic activity of wear particles.  Stimulation of the P2X7R by eATP can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and the NLRP3 inflammasome is primarily responsible for processing pro-IL1ß and pro-IL18 to the active cytokines in response to wear particles. However, the NLRP3 inflammasome must be primed prior to activation. Our preliminary results suggest that wear particles can both prime and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. We previously showed that the adherence of bacterial pathogen-associate molecular patterns (PAMPs) substantially increases the biologic activity of the particles. Aim 2 (mechanistic aim) will therefore determine how wear particles (with and without adherent PAMPs) affect ATP release, the P2X7R, and the NLRP3 inflammasome.  Highly-specific, drug-like antagonists of P2X7R can reduce inflammation in animal models and are in clinical trials for other inflammatory conditions. Aim 3 (translational aim) will therefore determine the effects of antagonists of P2X7R on biologic activity of the wear particles.  This project is ideal for the R21 mechanism: It is high risk because there are no previous studies on the effects of eATP or P2X7R in ?aseptic loosening?. It has the potential for high impact because the P2X7R antagonists were well tolerated in clinical trials for other inflammatory conditions. Our team possesses the necessary expertise and thus is uniquely positioned to efficiently complete this project."
"9535852","Summary Alzheimer's disease is ravaging the world's elderly population and creating a heath and societal burden that appears likely to increase. Basic research can inform on mechanisms relevant to late onset neurodegenerative disease and suggest avenues of treatment. Healthy aging of the brain requires meticulous maintenance of protein synthesis/folding/degradation systems, and this capacity is often disrupted in neurodegenerative disease. Recently it has come to be appreciated that disease neurons can produce toxic products like aggregated proteins that can be taken up by neighboring cells?there is speculation that this mechanism might be involved in disease spread within the brain. How neurons generate and send out large-sized extracellular material in vivo is an open question that must be addressed as we consider therapeutic intervention. We study the aging nervous system in the simple animal model C. elegans, in which individual neurons, as well as labeled aggregates within them, can easily be visualized in the living animal. We have unexpectedly discovered that some C. elegans neurons can exude large packets we call ?exophers?. The contents of these dramatically expelled exophers can contain introduced human disease protein aggregates. Multiple approaches to exaggerating protein folding stresses in those neurons, including over-expressing human Alzheimer's disease associated fragment A 1-42, and genetically or pharmacologically impairing branches of protein homeostasis, increase exopher formation. Aggregated proteins extruded in exophers can be taken up by distant cells. We hypothesize that we have identified a previously unrecognized alternative route for adult neurons to clear protein aggregates. We speculate that this mechanism, and the associated mechanism of release and uptake by surrounding cells, is conserved across species and related to currently unknown mechanisms operating in human brain relevant to neurodegenerative disease. We propose to exploit the considerable advantages of the C. elegans model system (transparent body, easy genetic manipulation, exquisitely defined nervous system, powerful cell biology, short lifespan) to advance understanding of exopher biology. Our goals are to: 1) probe the biology of old age exophers (induction, functionality, and longevity gene interface); 2) screen human neurodegenerative disease-related genes for roles in C. elegans exopher formation; 3) begin to decipher the mechanism whereby AIP-1, needed for exopher production and known to protect against broad proteotoxicity, influences exopher-genesis under proteo-stress. Our work should inform on a novel pathway of cell maintenance relevant to both healthy brain aging and a neurodegenerative disease, defining a new area for study and for development of clinical interventions."
"9462622","Abstract: The functional cure of the ?Berlin Patient? through transplantation of allogeneic CCR5?32 stem cells advocates for using gene-altered stem cells to confer lifetime protection against HIV-1 re-infection. Large-scale adoption of allogeneic transplantation of CCR5?32 stem cells is not possible however. The barriers to stem cell transplantation as a therapeutic option for HIV will be significantly lowered if gene-editing platforms could be used to safely and efficiently generate patient-specific CCR5 null CD34+ HSCs for autologous transplantation. At the same time, it is also clear that eradication of HIV reserves will be an important part of an effective and durable HIV cure. In this multi- disciplinary proposal we will apply several cutting edge technologies including modified-mRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platforms to engineer CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and CD8+ T-cells towards the goals generating HIV- resistant immune systems, and eradicating viral reserves."
"9507683","Project Summary/Abstract: While research efforts to develop highly-active antiretroviral therapy have greatly extended healthy lifespan for HIV-1 infected individuals receiving treatment, the virus poses unique challenges for the development of a long-sought after cure. Part of the viral lifecycle involves the permanent insertion of the HIV genome into a host cell's genetic material, establishing a long term population of HIV infected cells. New strategies to prevent spread from these cells must be developed. Unlike currently available antiviral drugs, anti-HIV gene therapy holds the potential for the treatment and even cure of HIV-1 infection. The gene therapy-mediated knockout of the HIV co-receptor CCR5 in HIV susceptible cells has shown potential in greatly reducing HIV viral loads in both mouse models of HIV disease and early phase human clinical trials. Surprisingly, in rare trial participants, this drop in viral load is sustained even when antiretroviral drug therapy is halted. However, all current anti-HIV gene therapy strategies rely on the separation and ex vivo manipulation of HIV susceptible cells, followed by re-infusion of these newly HIV-resistant cells back into patients. This approach requires access to advanced cell culture and bone marrow transplant facilities and is currently prohibitively expensive for the majority of HIV infected individuals living where the HIV epidemic continues to worsen. To address these technical, economic, and biological challenges, new approaches to inexpensive gene therapy must be developed. CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are an attractive target for gene therapy, given their status as predecessors to all cells susceptible to HIV. However, these cells have shown resistance to genetic modification by currently available lentiviral vectors. In new data introduced in this application, I demonstrate previously unforeseen levels of gene delivery to CD34+ HSPCs in vitro, achieved by pseudotyping lentiviral vectors with the measles virus hemagglutinin and fusion glycoproteins. Mechanistic insights from this work has guided mutagenesis of vesicular-stomatitis virus glycoproteins which will be used to identify restriction factors in CD34+ HSPCs. In this application, I propose using these novel lentiviral vectors to evaluate the potential of in vivo transduction as a potential anti-HIV strategy, using a humanized mouse model of HIV infection. By direct intrafemoral injection of lentiviral vectors carrying the CRISPR/Cas9 system targeting CCR5, I will evaluate if this approach can achieve sufficiently high levels of gene knockout to protect from HIV challenge. If successful, this approach holds the potential to radically reduce the cost and technical difficulty of anti-HIV gene therapy."

The mission of the DGRC is to 1) provide broad access to genomics resources by acquiring, archiving, curating, and distributing genomics resources including clones, vectors, and cell lines; 2) facilitate effective use of these genomics resources by providing guidance and support; and 3) improve the genomics resources and protocols available for Drosophila research. By preserving vital research materials and distributing them efficiently, the DGRC assures economical access and enhances scientific rigor and reproducibility. The first aim of this proposal is to continue and strengthen the successful DGRC programs for acquiring, distributing genomics resources and facilitating their effective use. This will include augmenting and updating data management systems, the web interface and user support, as well as continuing the effective cost recovery program. The goal is to maximize the long-term viability of the DGRC and its benefits to users and the NIH. The second aim is to increase the utility of Drosophila as a model system by generating new resources through four projects: 1) surveying the transfection and CRISPR/Cas9 efficiency of gene tagging across modENCODE cell lines, 2) generating a universal CRISPR/Cas9 based transfection toolkit for the insertion of constructs and the subsequent ability to generate stable transformants in any Drosophila cell line, 3) establishing a neuroblast cell line as a model for stem cell biology, and 4) creating new metabolic sensors for characterizing physiological processes in cell lines and Drosophila tissues."
"9455798","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiscale modeling using computer simulation is increasingly recognized as a major method, along with data-mining, for assimilating the vast and ever-growing knowledge base in systems biology. This will improve understanding of the links between molecules and disease manifestation for translational research to the clinic. The bridging of chemophysiology (chemical signaling in neurons and astrocytes) with electrophysiology provides a fundamental connection that will necessarily underpin higher organizational scales. Multiscale models are particularly dif?cult to simulate in neurobiology du to the elongated nature of neural cells (compared to compact cells for many other cell types), and to multiple overlapping of embedded scales (e.g., pyramidal apical dendrite domains at the same temporal and spatial scale as local networks). We are developing the widely used NEURON simulator to accommodate simulation of these complex second-messenger signal interactions that contribute to information processing. In the prior funding period, we added the reaction-diffusion module to NEURON, providing 3D deterministic diffusion linked to reactions situated in cytosol, on or within internal organelles, or on plasma membrane. We also added 1D deterministic diffusion to reduce high computational loads that limited the scope of simulations, noting that the detail of full 3D diffusion is not always needed. As part of these improvements, we extended NEURON's Python interface to include a new set of classes devoted to reaction-diffusion modeling. Additionally, we prepared connectors for interfacing with SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language). In the current proposal, we will build on these advances in order to allow development of mosaic simulations involving combinations of stochastic and deterministic simulation in both 3D and 1D. This will involve the ability to readily switch among these different levels of approximation so that different modeling approaches can be compared. These objectives will be achieved through the following Speci?c Aims: Aim 1. Multiple multigrid methods: 1D and 3D grids with different sized grids at different locations. Aim 2. Parallelization using multisplit methods that allow the simulation of a single neuron to be run across multiple processors or across multiple threads on a single processor. Aim 3. Stochastic simulation using an extended Gillespie method. This will complement additional stochastic methods that will also be made available in NEURON. Aim 4. Dissemination: new Graphical User Interface for front-end speci?cations for viewing results, model development, model importation and merging, method comparison and multiprocessor deployment. Making the tool accessible to the community via courses, tutorials, example programs, documentation and online help."
"9450539","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventral striatum (VS) are strongly implicated in decision-making and choice behavior. OFC occupies a large extent of cortex and comprises many subareas, but we have little idea of its functional organization. In addition, although there is evidence from human neuroimaging that VS plays a significant role in decision-making, we do not understand the computations that are taking place at the single neuron level. Although there are many studies of the neuronal properties of VS in rodents, there has been little work in primates, particularly with respect to decision-making. The current grant aims to determine the functional architecture of OFC and VS by recording the activity of neurons in different OFC subregions and VS during the performance of sophisticated decision-making tasks. This work has important clinical relevance. OFC and VS have been implicated in disorders involving impaired choice behavior, such as addiction. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these processes could lead to novel treatments for such disorders. We will examine two theoretical frameworks that are potentially of relevance to understanding OFC and VS functional organization. The first theory argues that the frontal lobe is organized hierarchically with more abstract information represented in more anterior frontal regions. If this organization extends to OFC, we would expect more abstract decision-making signals in more anterior areas of OFC. However, a contrary theory is that OFC encodes the specific outcome expected from making a specific choice. This information is then passed to VS, which integrates these specific predictions in order to encode a more generalized, abstract value signal. We will test these two theories by manipulating the abstractness of value-related information during the performance of complex decision-making tasks, and examining the neuronal encoding of this information in different areas of OFC and VS. First, we will examine the encoding of secondary reinforcers relative to primary reinforcers. Secondary reinforcers, such as money, can be used as abstract measures of value. We will examine whether neurons in more anterior parts of OFC are more likely to encode secondary reinforcers and examine how OFC and VS interact when a task is motivated via secondary reinforcement. Second, we will examine the involvement of OFC and VS in two processes thought to underlie decision-making: predicting the specific consequences of an action and assigning an abstract value to each of those consequences. Finally, we will examine whether OFC and VS encoding differs in relation to the temporal abstractness of decisions. In particular, much of our behavior is hierarchical. Decisions made at high levels of the hierarchy often require the attainment of intervening subgoals at lower levels of the hierarchy. Recent work has suggested that VS may be responsible for encoding the value of the goal and OFC responsible for encoding the value of subgoals necessary to attain the goal. We will test this using a hierarchical choice task."

"9433613","PROJECT SUMMARY There is an unmet clinical need for anabolic strategies to treat the 50 million women and men in the U.S. with severely or moderately low bone mass (osteoporosis or osteopenia, respectively). Mechanical loading is a potent, physiological means to stimulate bone formation and increase bone mass. However, with aging, humans and rodents have a decline in their ability to form bone in response to exercise and other forms of mechanical loading. The basis for this decline remains unknown. Our long-term goal is to identify key mechanisms in loading-induced bone formation in the adult skeleton so that we may inform future strategies to increase bone mass in osteoporosis. Our focus in this project is on the origin of osteoblasts that form bone in response to mechanical loading, and on the Wnt signaling pathway. We propose experiments using a physiological model of bone anabolism ? murine axial tibial compression ? that will extend our scientific knowledge as follows. First, we will determine the origin of osteoblasts (in young-adult and old mice) that form bone in response to in vivo mechanical loading. Modern lineage tracing and histological methods will be applied to address this basic unknown. Second, we will determine if osteoblast lineage cells in old mice are less proliferative than in young mice in response to in vivo loading. If so, this will provide motivation to develop strategies to target this deficit to enhance mechanoresponsiveness. Third, motivated by the finding that Wnts1 and 7b are highly responsive to bone mechanical loading, we will determine the role of these ligands produced by osteoblasts in loading-induced bone formation. Inducible, conditional deletion of Wnt 1 and 7b will be accomplished in adult mice, followed by mechanical loading and assessment of bone formation, cell proliferation and gene expression. If loss of Wnt 1 or 7b mimics the effects of aging, it will motivate targeted treatment strategies to rescue the mechanoresponsiveness of the aged skeleton. In summary, the decline in the anabolic response of bone to mechanical loading is a central feature of skeletal aging. The proposed studies will clarify the basis for this decline while addressing fundamental mechanisms that support loading-induced bone formation."
"9513612","The basal ganglia lie at the critical interface between movement and motivation. The striatum, the largest structure of these deep-lying structures, is a hub for inputs from the overlying neocortex and is a main distributor of output to other parts of the brain via basal ganglia output nuclei. This system is implicated in a large range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. It is modulated by neuromodulators, including by dopamine from the midbrain, deficient in Parkinson's disease. The dorsal striatum, the focus of this proposal, receives dopamine-containing input from the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNc). This nigrostriatal circuit degenerates in Parkinson's disease, and is a major controller of both motor behavior and responses to reinforcement and to motivational control. Our goal in the proposed research is to elucidate the physiology and anatomy of this system, focusing on critical questions related to these control mechanisms. First, our preliminary work suggests that the organization of the striatum into anatomically distinct compartments, the striosomes and surrounding matrix, is crucial in terms of behavior. Striosomes receive selective input from a restricted set of motivation/mood/emotion-related neocortical regions and are a main origin of the striatal projection to the SNc dopamine-containing neurons so important for mood and motor control. This evidence suggests special functions for striosomes, but what these functions are is not clear. Our preliminary and recent work suggests, however, that striosomes may be specialized for cost-benefit decision-making, in which costs and benefits presented in any situation have to be weighed in order for us to act. This kind of decision-making is critical for survival and, moreover, is disturbed in a number of neuropsychiatric conditions. We propose in Aim 1 to use state-of-the-art physiological and imaging methods in novel genetically engineered mice to test the hypothesis that striosomes underlie such decision-making. Second, our preliminary work has shown a remarkable anatomical organization of the striosome-SNc connection, suggesting that striosomes could exert powerful control over dopamine-containing SNc neurons. We propose to examine this system with novel combinations of optogenetic and physiological experiments combined with anatomy (Aim 2). Third, despite mounting evidence that striosome-matrix organization is a fundamentally important organizing property of the striatum, how this organization relates to the clinically critical division of the striatal output pathways into direct and indirect movement-control pathways is not understood. We aim to fill this gap by using specially engineered mice allowing direct testing of this relationship in physiological, imaging and behavioral experiments. Disturbances in the balance between cost and benefit in decision-making and movement control are critical in a number of neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders ranging from Parkinson's disease to obsessive-compulsive disorder to psychosis. Thus, the experiments proposed are directly related to the mission of the NIMH to understand, prevent and cure mental illness."
"9463446","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adiponectin has been well established as an insulin sensitizer to suppress glucose production and regulate hepatic lipid metabolism. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying adiponectin action remain largely unknown. Our laboratory identified for the first time an adiponectin receptor interactive protein, APPL1, which plays an essential role in adiponectin signaling. Subsequently, we showed that APPL2, an isoform of APPL1, acts as integrated Yin-Yang regulatory machinery with APPL1 to regulate adiponectin signaling in cells. To elucidate the mechanisms by which APPL isoforms regulate adiponectin signaling, we screened a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library using APPL2 as bait. This screening led to identification of TCTP as a binding protein that interacts with APPL isoforms. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that TCTP is a key regulator of adiponectin signaling in the liver and its interaction with APPL isoforms may provide a mechanism underlying obesity-induced down-regulation of adiponectin signaling. Impairment of adiponectin signaling together with reduced level of adiponectin in obesity and type 2 diabetes play important roles in development of insulin resistance. Understanding the mechanisms underlying TCTP-regulated adiponectin signaling may lead to identification of novel and effective therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders."
"9467460","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hand OA (HOA) is a painful, destructive and deforming polyarticular disorder that impairs an individual's ability to perform manipulative activities of daily life. Its high frequency and strong association with age has been the basis of attribution to inevitable joint degeneration, and of therapeutic nihilism. The severity of HOA can approach that of rheumatoid arthritis, yet in stark contrast to that rarer disorder has been the subject of little research and benefits from no treatments known to effect its development or progression. Involvement of hand joints is the commonest and most heritable manifestation of OA and is a sentinel for the `generalized' OA phenotype. While site-specific biomechanical factors are influential in its development, there is also evidence that bone health and constitutional factors predispose to incidence and progression of HOA. Risk of HOA is doubled in obese individuals, an association more plausibly attributable to systemic factors than the mechanical effect of overload. Indeed, recent epidemiological and clinical data indicate that metabolic syndrome rather than obesity has the greater impact on the initiation and severity of OA. The pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and OA involve abnormalities in common metabolic intermediates, however, the relationship of these pathways to the development and progression of HOA has been explored to only a limited extent. Recent investigations also indicate that the structural basis for HOA is broader than cartilage loss alone, with distinct pathological pathways that include osteophytosis, marginal and central joint erosion. Also, there is clinical controversy about whether erosive HOA is a separate entity, or simply more advanced disease. We will analyze annually-collected longitudinal radiographic, covariate and outcome data, and biospecimens from the Osteoarthritis Initiative, the largest most comprehensive cohort study of OA, and perform semi- quantitative and computer-aided image measurements across multiple hand joints to evaluate and contrast the roles of structural and metabolic characteristics in the development of radiographic, symptomatic and erosive HOA."
"9536442","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): T cell histone GlcNAcylation participates in the epigenetics of lupus ABSTRACT Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects women ten times more often than men. Altered T cell signaling links genetic and environmental factors and contributes to disease etiopathogenesis. DNA methylation, histone modification, and miRNA regulate gene expression and chromatin structure by modifying the epigenome. DNA methylation suppresses gene transcription and in SLE, the female inactive X-chromosome is hypomethylated, which causes overexpression of genes that predispose females to lupus. SLE is also characterized by global T cell DNA hypomethylation that causes overexpression of immune- related genes and subsequent autoimmunity. We recently found that OGT (O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase), an X-linked gene, is overexpressed in female lupus T cells. OGT reversibly adds ß-N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues of proteins competing with phosphorylation. This makes OGT a regulator of cell signaling and transcription. Interestingly, GlcNAcylated protein levels are increased in female, but not male, T cell lupus patients, which correlate with OGT overexpression. Furthermore, O-GlcNAc is considered part of the histone code, and OGT regulates O-GlcNAcylation of histones. Histone 2B (H2B) is GlcNAc at Ser 112, a modification that facilitates H2BK120 ubiquitination required for transcriptional activation. Additionally, Ten Eleven Translocation enzymes TET2 and TET3 interact directly with OGT and co-localize on chromatin at active promoters. The effects of OGT in signaling pathways and on chromatin structure of T cells are unknown but may play an important role in T cell dysfunction in lupus as well as autoimmunity in general. We hypothesize that OGT overexpression in female lupus T cells modifies signaling pathways and DNA- histone binding profiles by O-GlcNAc of protein targets and chromatin remodelers. Hence, OGT may ultimately be an epigenetic modulator in lupus. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use proteomic and genetic approaches to: 1) Identify molecular targets of OGT, which are key proteins in T cell signaling that may contribute to the pathogenesis of lupus; 2) Determine whether overexpression of OGT in CD4 T cells results in altered glycosylation of histone proteins; and 3) Examine the effects of H2B modifications on gene regulation in cells that overexpress OGT This study will uncover abnormalities in T cell pathways and changes in gene regulation in SLE caused by OGT, a gene aberrantly expressed in female lupus T cells that may predispose females to the disease. By identifying new biomarkers and targets this project will serve as the foundation for future studies aimed at improving therapies for patients suffering from SLE and potentially other autoimmune diseases."
"9548102","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, lupus) is characterized by the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies that promote tissue injury, including in the kidney. Pathogenic autoantibodies in lupus undergo affinity maturation and immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype switching in germinal centers (GCs) within secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), a site of CD4+ T cell-dependent (TD) B cell maturation. Yet, the specific subsets of effector CD4+ T cells that promote auto-reactive B development, and the regulation of these cells, are not well defined. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells comprise a subset of CD4+ T helper (Th cells, phenotypically and functionally distinct from other Th cells, such as the classical the Th1, Th2 and Th17 subsets. They reside in B cell follicles and GCs and are essential for B cell maturation and (auto) antibody production. Tfh cells express proteins critical for their development and GC maturation. They also secrete the canonical cytokine interleukin (IL)-21 that is necessary for GC B cell development, as well as the classical Th1 and Th2 cytokines IFN-¿ and IL-4, appropriate to pathogen challenge, and that are also necessary for B cell maturation as well as Ig isotype switch. Unlike the classical CD4+ Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell subsets, the mechanism of cytokine production by Tfh cells is unclear. I have used model systems to explore Tfh-cell cytokine production and its role in B cell maturation, with the long-term goal to investigate these events in pathogenic autoantibody production in SLE. I have demonstrated in work submitted for publication that Tfh cells following model (viral) infection secrete both IL-21 and IFN-? as do classical Th1 cells, and as also occurs in SLE. My findings underscore the complexity of the genetic regulation of cytokine production by CD4+ T cells following pathogen challenge and, importantly, in SLE. Inhibition of IFN-? and IL-21 is beneficial in murine lupus with these cytokines as therapeutic targets in SLE; however, their contribution to disease is not fully understood. I hypothesize that the factor(s) defining Tfh- cell cytokines compared to Th1 cells will have consequences in lupus, and may represent novel therapeutic targets. Accordingly, I will dissect the factors that regulate these responses in a viral infection model and in spontaneous lupus, utilizing novel genetically modified cytokine reporter mice that I have created and/or bred. I will use these tools to explore the interplay of transcriptional regulation, dynamic chromatin architecture, regulatory protein binding, and genomic organization in cytokine production in Th1 and Tfh cells following viral challenge (a tractable system) and in lupus (a more complex model), using novel genomics approaches combined with fundamental cellular immunology experiments. These tools will bolster my research skills in the setting of this career development award, and will enable me to identify the common classes of regulatory elements in both cytokine genes. Ultimately, this work should help me distinguish pathogenic and nonpathogenic effector T cells, aiding therapeutic design, and serve to launch my independent research career."
"9481175","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study is designed to determine how distinct subsets of melanocyte stem cells (MSCs) we have identified are regulated and maintained in the stem cell state and contribute to pigment regeneration. The rationale for the study is based upon our discovery that MSCs not only populate a region of the murine hair follicle (HF) termed the bulge, also the site of keratinocyte stem cells (KcSCs) of the HF, but also the secondary hair germ (SHG), a transient structure at the base of the telogen, or resting, HF adjacent to the dermal papilla. Our laboratory has developed methods to separate and study these two cell subsets in the viable state using a combination of a unique transgenic mouse system and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).The objectives of our studies are to determine which of these MSC subsets has greater regenerative potential, and to describe the interrelationship between and maintenance determinants of these distinct subsets. To realize this objective, we plan to test in vitro and in vivo the capacity of these cell subsets to self-renw, maintain quiescence, and also regenerate pigmentation in previously unpigmented living HFs. These studies will be accomplished a unique, bitransgenic mouse line we have developed, Dct-H2BGFPki, in combination with the FACS facility and other core resources associated with my research laboratory located in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. The results of these studies should have a positive impact on the health care of the general public. By determining which murine MSC subsets are most effective at regenerating pigmentation, we will be able to apply that knowledge to human melanocytes, isolating or generating human cells with potent regenerative properties. These cells can be developed to treat patients with the depigmenting disease vitiligo or for regenerating pigmentation in healing wounds or scars. In addition, stem cells are related to cancer because genes repressed epigenetically in stem cells are more likely to be suppressed in the corresponding cancer cell type. By determining the epigenetic state of key melanocyte and growth genes in MSCs, we may highlight molecular mechanisms leading to irreversible gene repression in melanoma developing, thereby revealing how particular cells of origin contribute to the development of this particular malignancy."
"9230803","DESCRIPTION: Treated HIV positive patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and other HIV- associated non-AIDS conditions. Ongoing immune activation, despite effective treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART), increases risk for CVD and non-AIDS conditions, but also contributes to lymphatic tissue fibrosis, limiting immune recovery that further increases risk for non-AIDS conditions. Biologic aging also leads to systemic inflammation and waning immune function, and, thus, non-AIDS conditions and poly-morbidity will continue to increase as the HIV population ages. Identifying safe treatments that target this pathology represents a major unmet need for older HIV positive patients. We propose a randomized placebo-controlled trial of losartan (100mg daily) among n=120 antiretroviral-treated HIV positive persons age >50 years receiving effective ART with undetectable HIV RNA levels. We will study the treatment effects of losartan on changes in IL-6 levels over 6 months and changes in peripheral blood CD4 count over 12 months. We hypothesize that losartan treatment will: a) reduce systemic inflammation that will be accounted for through reductions in monocyte activation within peripheral blood, and b) lead to immune recovery, as reflected in blood CD4+ count, via down-regulating immune activation and TGF-?-mediated fibrosis in lymphatic tissues that will improve T- cell homeostasis and survival of naive T-cells. Our investigative team has helped define the role of inflammation in non-AIDS disease risk as well as developed the model that links lymph node fibrosis with impaired T-cell homeostasis. This work directly informed our choice of outcomes, which both test fundamental HIV pathogenesis questions and will determine if losartan improves immune activation and immune recovery to a degree that may be clinically relevant. Our methods and hypotheses are innovative, our intervention is novel in the context of HIV infection, and our approach provides essential randomized data to inform and justify the expense of subsequent clinical outcome trials. In summary, this translational trial addresses a high priority HIV research agenda to identify disease-modifying strategies for non-AIDS conditions among older patients."

"9473726","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive decline and dementia have become important public health issues in our time as medical science has increased lifespan and our society becomes progressively older. A great deal of the cognitive decline due to aging can be explained by decline in working memory (WM), a mental function central to cognition in which aging deficits appear almost universally. Attempts to use WM training to increase WM ability in older adults has had some success, but the transfer of performance enhancements caused by this training to other cognitive skills is controversial. Another intervention that shows much promise is noninvasive stimulation of cerebral cortex using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which has been shown to increase performance in many cognitive tasks. In previous work we developed a paradigm using fMRI-guided TMS in which we identified a cortical network sensitive to the effects of sleep deprivation and to WM and targeted it with TMS, almost completely remediating the deficits in WM performance caused by the sleep deprivation, and whose effects outlasted TMS stimulation by at least a day. We then applied this paradigm to healthy young and older adults, to assess the effects of aging on WM. Stimulation to the left lateral occipital complex, a region involved in the maintenance of visual information, enhanced WM performance in both young and older groups. Here we propose to use our fMRI-guided TMS enhancement paradigm to stimulate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a region involved not only in the maintenance of items in WM, but also in their manipulation, in order to create WM performance enhancements that will be long lasting and that will transfer to other cognitive tasks as well. This will be achieved through three studies. In the first we will stimulat both old and young healthy adults while they perform different WM tasks that will increasingly engage DLPFC in order to demonstrate enhancement of WM performance that is greater in the older adults. In the second and third studies, older adults will receive active or sham TMS over two weeks of daily sessions while they perform the WM tasks. In the second study, we hope to demonstrate that the cumulative effect of multiple TMS sessions, in tandem with the synergistic effects of simultaneous TMS + WM training, create WM performance enhancements greater than those found with WM training alone, whose effects are long-lasting, continuing a month following the course of TMS sessions. In the third, we will investigate whether the WM enhancements generated by the two- weeks of TMS sessions will generalize to other cognitive tasks. Success of these studies will provide proof in principle for long-lasting, transferable effects of TMS in remediating WM and more general cognitive deficits due to aging, and point to a possible non-invasive brain stimulation therapy for cognitive decline in healthy aging and in dementia."

"9542559","Project Summary/Abstract Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by demyelination and inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). In 2010 the FDA approved fingolimod as the first orally available MS drug. It is phosphorylated in vivo, allowing it to bind four of the five known sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors (S1PR), S1P1, 3, 4, 5. The mechanism of action (MOA) of fingolimod in MS is thought to be through lymphocyte sequestration of pathogenic cells in the secondary lymphoid organs via inactivation of S1P1. However, several lines of evidence including studies using a mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), have supported the existence of another MOA for fingolimod involving non-immune, CNS activities. We will test the central hypothesis that each S1PR has a unique role in EAE development and progression through regulating the immune and/or nervous system. We will apply an innovative approach, that utilizes nuclear RNA-seq and reporter mice that specifically detect activity after EAE challenge that has identified astrocytes, along with on a collection of S1P receptor knockout mice, to address three Specific Aims: Aim 1) Determine S1PRs that exacerbate EAE, followed by revealing their roles in EAE pathogenesis; focusing on S1P5 and S1P4; Aim 2)! Define VB12 homeostasis regulation by astrocyte S1P1 in EAE; and Aim 3)! Discover clinical relevancies of S1PR modulators in combination with VB12. This proposal will provide groundbreaking discoveries of: 1) roles of immunological and neuronal S1P5 in EAE pathogenesis, 2) new functions of S1P4 in T cell regulation and EAE development, 3) deciphering S1PR signaling complexity in T cells and oligodendrocytes, 4) a novel MOA of fingolimod that astrocyte S1P1 controls VB12 homeostasis in the CNS, and 5) a new therapeutic strategy, i.e., VB12 supplementation to fingolimod therapy. Moreover, our research demonstrates the biological and clinical significance of S1P signaling in MS and neuroimmunology, along with public health awareness of the importance of adequate vitamin B12 intake to prevent diseases and to maintain overall health."
"9472394","The initiation and maintenance of motivated behaviors often are characterized by a high degree of vigor,speed, persistence and work output, and organisms frequently make effort-related decisions based upon cost/benefit analyses. In addition, clinicians emphasize the importance of effort-related symptoms, such as anergia, psychomotor retardation, apathy and fatigue, in major depression and other disorders. These motivational symptoms are among the most common symptoms of depression; they can strongly interfere with activities of daily living, and can be highly resistant to treatment. While catecholamine uptake inhibitors appear to be somewhat effective drugs for treating the psychomotor/motivational symptoms of depression, clinical studies indicate that serotonin transport (SERT) inhibitors such as fluoxetine are relatively poor at treating anergia and fatigue, and in fact, can induce or exacerbate these symptoms. Our laboratory has developed behavioral tasks in rodents that assess the brain mechanisms regulating the exertion of effort and effort-related choice behavior. These tests of effort-related choice behavior allow animals to make choices between high-effort alternatives that lead to more highly valued rewards vs. low-effort alternatives that lead to less valued reward (i.e., less preferred or lower in magnitude). Recently, our laboratory has demonstrated that tests of effort-based choice behavior can be used as animal models of the effort-related motivational symptoms of depression. A number of conditions associated with depression in humans can alter effort-related choice in rats, and bias animals towards low-effort options. For example, rats treated with vesicular monoamine transport inhibitor tetrabenazine, which induces or exacerbates symptoms of depression in humans, can alter effort-related choice, reducing selection of the high effort alternative. These effects can be reversed by co-administration of putative antidepressants such as the adenosine A2A antagonist MSX-3, the established antidepressant bupropion (Wellbutrin), which inhibits catecholamine uptake, and the selective dopamine (DA) uptake blockers GBR12909 and PRX-14040. Importantly, research from our laboratory shows that SERT inhibitors, rather than reversing the effort-related effects of tetrabenazine, actually tend to exacerbate them. Furthermore, our recent studies show that the SERT inhibitor fluoxetine reduces effort expenditure and lowers extracellular DA in nucleus accumbens, which is consistent with the relatively poor effects of these drugs on motivational symptoms in depressed people. The goal of the proposed investigation is to determine if the 5-HT2C receptor mediates these effects by studying the ability of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C antagonists, injected systemically or intracranially, to reverse the effects of fluoxetine on effort-related decision making and extracellular DA in nucleus accumbens. This research could lead to a greater understanding of the neurochemical mechanisms that underlie the regulation of effort-related aspects of motivation, and foster the development of treatments that augment the therapeutic efficacy of 5-HT uptake inhibitors."
"9653635","Project Summary/Abstract Orofacial pain is one of the most prevalent and debilitating conditions arising from the structures innervated by the trigeminal system (head, face, masticatory musculature, temporomandibular joint and associated structures). The most significant complications from dental procedures such as surgical interventions and root canal treatments are iatrogenic trigeminal nerve injuries, which can result in trigeminal neuropathic pain causing considerable functional and psychological disability. The current management of trigeminal neuropathic pain is inadequate. For a major number of patients, the therapeutic options available do not deliver successful pain control, or intolerable side effects arise resulting in their discontinued use and poor quality of life. Trigeminal neuropathic pain (TNP) is the result of sensitization in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and in areas within the central nervous system (CNS) related to pain processing, but we do not understand completely the mechanisms of this sensitization and unfortunately this has limited the creation of new therapeutic options. Activation of A3AR (adenosine A3 receptor) has been shown to be a safe therapeutic approach producing persistent pain relief in neuropathic pain models. In addition, our preliminary data support peroxynitrite (PN), a free radical that is a powerful antioxidant and nitrating agent involved in neuropathic pain mechanisms, to be involved also in orofacial pain. Together, this suggests that A3AR activation may represent a novel therapeutic approach in TNP, via a downstream mechanism that involves preventing the production of PN. Therefore research efforts will be focused on activating A3AR in a rat model of trigeminal nerve injury that resembles the TNP observed in humans, with the use of a highly selective drug (A3AR agonist) that has been shown to induce strong pain relief in diverse rodent models of neuropathic pain. In addition, we will determine the involvement of PN in trigeminal neuropathic pain, and establishing whether the A3AR agonist blocks PN formation. To focus experimental objectives, we hypothesize that: ?Highly selective A3AR agonists are protective against TNP by decreasing PN production?. To test this hypothesis we will use molecular biological techniques to first determine the expression of A3AR along the PNS and central areas within the brain that are involved in processing trigeminal pain information. Second, we will investigate whether activation of A3AR relieves persistent pain in the rat model of trigeminal nerve injury, using behavioral nociceptive sensory thresholds. Third, using immunohistochemistry we will investigate whether TNP induces PN formation in the same areas in the PNS and CNS regions were A3AR is located and if activation of A3AR blocks PN formation. Testing this hypothesis is highly significant because it will provide the foundation for a new translational effort for the use of drugs that activate the A3AR for the management of TNP, supporting for the first time, A3AR activation as a protective function against TNP, while providing insight into an initial mechanistic understanding of sensitization after trigeminal injury involving PN pathways."
"9644813","There is overwhelming evidence of racial disparities in health care and mounting evidence of disparities for other traditionally disadvantaged or stigmatized groups. Physician behavior and decision-making are documented contributors to disparities in care. Studies examining why well-intentioned and egalitarian physicians' provide unequal care point to the role of implicit (automatic, unconscious) biases, which have been shown to affect physicians' clinical decision-making, interpersonal processes of care, and to directly affect patient trust and subsequent adherence. Furthermore, medical students and physicians have been found to have high levels of implicit bias towards sexual minority and obese individuals that are likely to contribute to documented disparities in care for these groups. The proposed renewal builds on an unprecedented longitudinal study involving a rich dataset collected from a cohort of over 3959 medical students in their 1st and 4th year of medical school who were enrolled in the Medical Student CHANGES Study (1 R01 HL085631, Contributors to Racial Bias in Medical Student Judgment and Decision-Making). In Medical Student CHANGES we found that specific activities in the formal curricula, negative role-modelling, interracial contact, and diversity climate all predicted change in implicit racial bias between the 1st and 4th years of medical school. The proposed renewal uses a longitudinal repeated measures design to assess the impact of residency experiences among this cohort, independently and in combination with individual and medical school factors, on: 1) racial, obesity and sexual orientation biases and 2) attitudes and behavior that have been shown to protect from, or exacerbate, the impact of bias on clinical behavior and decision-making. The proposed renewal will serve as a much-needed and entirely novel examination of the effect of residency training, climate and informal and formal norms on racial, sexual orientation, and obesity bias in new physicians. In addition to adding to our understanding of how residency affects bias, it will provide insight into the way residency influences new physician behavior shown to reduce the impact of biases on behavior and decision-making. Last, it will allow for disentangling the effect of individual, medical school, and residency factors so that more effective interventions can be developed. This renewal proposal is part of a program of research intended to evaluate and improve the degree to which physician training promotes physicians' ability to provide equally high quality and patient-centered care to diverse patients. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study of this scope that investigates changes in medical trainees' social attitudes and experiences that can directly influence the quality of medical care they will provide to members of historically stigmatized groups. Understanding the factors that shape medical physician trainees' beliefs and attitudes across their medical training will provide unique information for new interventions that can promote more effective healthcare for traditionally disadvantaged or stigmatized groups."
"9463628","Abstract Daily exercise is a low-cost treatment that improves metabolic health and protects against age-related diseases. However, many people are unable to perform an endurance exercise regimen due to illness, disability, advanced age or a work schedule that enforces sedentary behavior. Furthermore, humans have wide individual differences in their response to exercise. The genetic factors that cause this variance are not well understood. Here, we propose to use the fruit fly genetic model system to identify the causes of this variance. In the process, we will identify novel targets for therapeutic pharmaceuticals that can mimic the benefits of exercise in patients that are unable to complete an exercise program. Preliminary data strongly shows that activation of octopaminergic neurons during exercise is critical for inducing metabolic adaptations in muscle and fat. Furthermore, treatment with octopamine is capable of inducing exercise adaptations in sedentary flies. Here, we will identify which receptor or receptors are required for octopamine signaling to induce these benefits (Aim 1). Secondly, we will take advantage of sex-specific differences in exercise response in flies to identify the genetic differences that cause individual variation in response to daily exercise. These results will 1) inform the development of diagnostics to predict individual responses to exercise training, and 2) provide novel targets for therapeutics to provide the benefits of exercise to sedentary patients."

"9520148","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is escalating in California and the United States and is associated with  the rising obesity epidemic. NAFLD is a hepatic phenotype that encompasses the more serious manifestation of  steatohepatitis (NASH), considered to be a prerequisite for liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma/HCC). We  also know from recent clinical studies that chemical toxicant exposure, in the absence of obesity, can lead to  toxicant-associated steatohepatitis (TASH), which closely resembles the pathology of NASH. These findings are  relevant to SRP stakeholders in Region 9, since California ranks high in National Priorities List (Superfund sites)  nationally and contains thousands of additional hazardous waste sites (HWS). In addition, the UCSD NAFLD  Research Center shows that American Indians and Hispanics, combined the largest non-Caucasian population  in California, are at far greater risk of developing NAFLD. Over the past five years, our SRC has leveraged  resources to demonstrate that TASH is greatly accelerated by consumption of high-fat diet (HFD) or after a  diabetic episode in mice. These findings are relevant, since we can speculate that American Indians and  Hispanics are more susceptible to TASH development, a risk amplified by unhealthy diets, poverty and health  disparities. The UCSD SRC will be developing models through its Biomedical projects to characterize the  mechanisms of Superfund toxicant induced TASH development and cancer, while the Environmental Science &  Engineering (ES&E) projects will develop tools for NPL-toxicant detection and remediation. Biomedical and  ES&E projects will be assisted in these efforts by Research Core services that will provide tools for mouse  genetic production, metabolomic and sophisticated Bioinformatic analysis. A key objective of the projects is to  highlight scientific findings to maximize Research Translation, which will happen with collaborations between the  projects and the Research Translation Core. We believe our program is innovative and paradigm shifting, since  it has the potential of linking important basic research findings regarding Superfund toxicant exposure with  human disease biomarker identification through collaborations with the UCSD NAFLD Research Center, which  contains one of the largest NALFD cohort studies in the world. Importantly, our Biomedical findings and tools  developed in the ES&E projects will be used as resources and knowledge gained to reduce cumulative impacts  and health disparities. These initiatives will be leveraged through Community Engagement Core efforts in  disadvantaged Hispanic neighborhoods in San Diego and Mexico where statistics confirms that obesity is an  escalating problem both in children and adults. Since the incidence of NAFLD and liver cirrhosis is on the rise in  both children and adults and may be linked to toxicant chemical exposure, our findings will be communicated to  SRP primary stakeholders at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Agency for Toxic Substances  and Disease Registry, in addition to state and local agencies."
"9498577","ABSTRACT     There is a critical need to develop novel therapies for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The  incidence  of  HPV-­related  HNSCC  is  rapidly  rising  in  the  United  States  and  other  countries  around  the  world,  while  tobacco-­related  HNSCC  remains  an  aggressive  disease  with  poor  prognosis  and  limited  therapeutic  options.  Worldwide,  HNSCC  accounts  for  over  600,000  cases  annually  and  is  a  leading  cause  of  cancer  mortality  in  developing  countries.  A  majority  of  HNSCC  patients  present  initially  with  locally  or  locoregionally  advanced  disease,  yet  these  patients  largely  succumb  to  locally  recurrent  disease.  Gene  expression  profiling  and  modeling  strongly  support  a  critical  role  for  inflammation  in  HNSCC  initiation  and  progression.  Immune  therapy  holds  promise  for  the  treatment  of  HNSCC,  as  the  immunotherapeutic  agent  nivolumab  (anti-­PD-­1)  recently  demonstrated  clinical  activity  in  a  small  percentage  of  patients  with  recurrent/metastatic  HNSCC.  However,  these  findings  suggest  that  HNSCC  patients  would  be  excellent  candidates  for  novel  immune  therapeutics  that  could  target  resistance  to  anti-­PD-­1.  We  have  found  that  PI3K?  in  immune  suppressive  Tumor  Associated  Macrophages  (TAMs)  promotes  tumor  immune  suppression  and  resistance  to  checkpoint  inhibitors in mouse models of HNSCC. Genetic or pharmacological inactivation of PI3K?,  but not of other PI3K  isoforms,  repolarized  TAMs  toward  a  pro-­inflammatory,  anti-­tumor  phenotype  and  synergized  with  checkpoint  inhibitors  to  activate  memory  T  cells  and  eradicate  HNSCC  tumors.  Our  studies  indicate  that  PI3K?  inhibitors,  such  as  the  investigational  agent  IPI-­549,  may  be  valuable  immune  oncologic  agents  to  treat  and  monitor  HNSCC patient outcomes. Our studies also identified a novel PI3K?-­driven signature of immune suppression -­ that  predicts  decreased  survival  in  HNSCC  patients.  We  propose  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  this  PI3K?-­ mediated  signature  of  immune  suppression  can  be  used  to  monitor  therapeutic  responses  to  PI3K?  inhibitors.  We will also test the hypothesis that therapeutic strategies that block PI3K?-­mediated immune suppression will  synergize  with  T  cell  targeted  therapeutics  to  improve  outcomes  in  HNSCC  patients.  The  specific  aims  of  this  proposal  are  1)  To  Identify  the  mechanisms  by  which  PI3K?  inhibitors  synergize  with  anti-­PD-­1  to  promote  T  cell recruitment and activation in vivo, using mouse models of HPV+ and HPV-­ carcinogen-­induced HNSCC, 2)  To  determine  the  effect  of  the  PI3K?  inhibitor  IPI-­549  on  tumor  immune  responses  in  patients  with  resectable  HNSCC,  3)  To  evaluate  biomarkers  of  immune  response  in  recurrent/metastatic  HNSCC  patients  treated  with  IPI-­549 in combination with anti-­PD-­1.    "
"9538085","ABSTRACT The hematopoietic subsyndrome of acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) is induced with even moderate exposure to ionizing radiation, which is lethal to hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the bone marrow (BM). Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a potential life-saving treatment for H-ARS victims; however, it is not generally recommended due to commonly associated complication of graft-versus-host disease. Recent clinical trials, including that of our collaborator, have demonstrated that mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSC) infusions prevent/treat graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and reduce graft failure following HSCT. These salutary effects of MSC are due to potent immunomodulatory properties of the cells. Furthermore, MSC possess many other therapeutic properties shown to ameliorate pathologies associated with other ARS syndromes effecting the gastrointestinal system, skin and liver. Thus, MSC have the potential to treat the full spectrum of pathologies associated with ionizing radiation exposure. Ossium Health is developing a unique source of BM-derived multipotent MSC obtained from deceased organ donors. This cellular therapy, termed OssioStem-M3 (matched multipotent MSC) has a distinct advantage over other MSC sources in that it is donor-matched to a source for HSCT grafts (OssioStem-HSC) obtained from the same donors. Additionally, the large volumes of BM that can be obtained from a deceased donor yield exceptionally high numbers of MSC. This is important given that efficacy of MSC for supporting HSCT is negatively related to passage number; thus, low passage OssioStem-M3 is superior to ?third party? MSC obtained from living donors which must be amplified through many passages. We propose here to optimize methods for isolation of OssioStem-M3 and thoroughly characterize their physical characteristics and biological function. We also propose to demonstrate efficacy in large (porcine) and small (mouse) models of H-ARS. Finally, we will build and test next generation devices for increasing the consistency and throughput of OssioStem-HSC production. The overall product of this research program will be a robust production process and a compelling preclinical package to justify definitive studies to support FDA approval for H-ARS under the Animal Rule."
"9477663","PI3K/Akt signaling is fundamental in the immune system, cardiovascular and neuronal diseases, and cancers. It is the most commonly deregulated signaling pathway in cancers and is therapeutically targeted. We show that the multi-domain scaffolding oncoprotein, IQGAP1 provides a novel molecular platform for assembly of PI4P-, PI4,5P2- and PI3,4,5P3-generating enzymes (PI4KIII?, PIPKI? and PI3K). This close proximity allows for concerted and efficient generation of the PI3,4,5P3 lipid messenger that activates the also associated PDK1/Akt kinases. Multiple agonists including integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein coupled receptors stimulate this scaffold. Importantly, this scaffold appears crucial for cancer cell survival, uncovering a phosphoinositide signaling nexus utilized by cancer cells for their survival. IQGAP1 associates with PI3K and PIPKI? via its WW and IQ sub-domains. Disrupting this IQGAP1 scaffold abrogates PI3,4,5P3 generation and Akt activation and selectively blocks survival of cancer cells. This indicates that concerted PI3,4,5P3 synthesis with PDK1 and Akt activation in cancer cells via the IQGAP1 scaffold opens the door for novel therapeutic strategy targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in cancers. Further, IQGAP2 has tumor suppressor activity and also binds the PIPn kinases blocks Akt activation within the same pathways. Hypothesis: Upon agonist stimulation, IQGAP1 scaffolds phosphoinositide kinases for concerted production of the PI3,4,5P3 lipid messenger, leading to self-contained PI3K/Akt signaling platform. Selective integration of PIPKI isoforms (e.g. PIPKI? vs. PIPKI?) into IQGAP1 scaffolds and their regulation of PI4,5P2 and/or PI3,4,5P3 generation and downstream activation controls distinct processes including cell proliferation, survival, invasion and motility. IQGAP2 binding to the PIPn kinases blocks the tumor promoting activity of the PIPn kinases. This hypothesis will be interrogated with the following aims: Aim 1. How does EGF-stimulation specifically assemble the IQGAP1-PI3K scaffold? (a) Role of tyrosine phosphorylation, (b) define interaction sites, substrate channeling, and identify mutants that lose binding and study integration of oncogenic PI3K mutants, and (c) examine if these require EGFR signaling. Aim 2. Study how EGFR and small G-proteins regulate IQGAP1-PIPn kinase scaffolds during migration and invasion. Roles of: (a) the IQGAP1-PI3K scaffold in cell motility, (b) the IQGAP1-PIPKI? scaffold in trafficking of EGFR and integrins in EGF-stimulated migration and invasion, (c) IQGAP1 in Arf6 and Rac1 in control of invasion and (d) study the role of PIPn binding to IQGAP1 in spatial targeting, survival, and invasion. Aim 3. Investigate the IQGAP2-phosphoinositide kinase scaffold as a tumor suppressor. (a) Study interactions of phosphoinositide kinases with IQGAP2 and peptide inhibitors will be developed, (b) define the mechanism how IQGAP2 blocks Akt activation, (c) manipulate expression of IQGAP2 to examine roles in the PI3K signaling and biology."
"9463553","PROJECT SUMMARY Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) must be regarded not only as a subject for pharmacoepidemiologists and clinical pharmacologists, but as an important issue for public health, particularly in older adults confronted with multiple chronic conditions. Known DDIs are responsible for 13% of adverse drug events and 4.8% of hospital admissions in older adults. Even these high figures may understate the true impact of DDIs because they include only the effects of known interactions. Many clinically important DDIs take years to discover. Given the widespread and growing use of multiple medications by older adults, there is tremendous potential for DDIs to occur in this population, especially among those treated with high risk therapies like warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants. Based on known metabolic pathways, these anticoagulants may interact with many commonly- prescribed medications. DDIs involving anticoagulants can cause over- or under-anticoagulation, the sequelae of which can be immediately life-threatening and have long-term consequences. The broad objective of this project is to produce clinically-actionable and biologically-relevant knowledge about which drugs interact with anticoagulants to cause serious bleeding and/or thromboembolism, as well as the time-course of such interactions and the subgroups most susceptible to these DDIs. We will achieve this objective by taking a translational science approach to DDIs in which we 1) perform high-throughput simulation of potential DDIs based on pharmacologic knowledge; 2) perform high-throughput screening of healthcare data; and then 3) confirm (or refute) and elucidate selected high-probability DDIs in an independent population by conducting in-depth pharmacoepidemiologic studies. This project will produce clinically-actionable knowledge about which drugs interact with anticoagulants to cause serious bleeding and/or thromboembolism, and generalizable biological knowledge about the drugs and pathways involved in these interactions."
"9461002","Project Summary Despite the potential for full recovery surprisingly few older injury survivors are able to realize maximal recovery of function and quality of life after injury due to fragmentation of care delivery and lack of focus on psychological symptoms in the early post-injury period. Older injured adults are at particular risk of death and disability after injury. Thus, a fundamental gap in knowledge exists regarding the best way to enhance the recovery of injury survivors. The continued existence of this gap is an important problem because unless it is filled, injury survivors will continue to suffer from potentially reversible impairments of health and well-being. The long-term goal of this line of research is to improve the health and quality of care for injured patients. The objective of this application is to apply the concepts of collaborative care to the non-neurologically injured patient population. Indiana University School of Medicine researchers have over 20 years of experience developing innovative and effective collaborative care models that integrate with primary care and specialty physicians to address the complex biopsychosocial needs of patients with chronic disease states, such as dementia and depression. Based on these successes, an interdisciplinary team of clinical investigators at Indiana University revised the collaborative care model to meet the needs of injury survivors who are in an active recovery state. This injury specific collaborative care model is called the Trauma Medical Home (TMH). This proposal aims to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a 6-month collaborative care intervention in improving the functional and psychological recovery of 430 injury survivors 50 and older. The trial has the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate the ability of the TMH intervention to improve the physical recovery of older injury survivors; and 2) Evaluate the ability of the TMH intervention to improve the psychological recovery of older injury survivors; and 3) Evaluate the ability of the TMH intervention to reduce healthcare costs of older injury survivors and evaluate the cost of effectiveness of the TMH intervention. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo. Previous collaborative care models focused on chronic care management and they lack rapid adaptability. Because the recovery trajectory of injured patients is dynamic and changes quickly, the innovations in this proposal have to do with providing real-time feedback to a care coordinator that will allow the care coordinator to adjust an injury specific collaborative care protocol to meet the needs of the injured as they move through the dynamic recovery period after injury. This contribution will be significant as broad application of the Trauma Medical Home in trauma centers and trauma systems nationwide could result in better health and improved quality of post-injury care for older injured patients. Improved physical health and fewer psychological symptoms, will likely result in better overall functional ability, the increased ability to return to work and less reliance on family, social, and health care resources."

The overall scientific focus of the JHADRC is on the earliest stages of AD and related disorders in humans and in model systems, through characterizing the earliest clinical and pathophysiological processes in humans, and by identifying cellular and molecular events that contribute to the abnormalities in model systems that capture aspects of the human disorders. We also focus efforts on improving care of patients in the symptomatic phases of disease. We have made substantial progress with these research goals during the current funding cycle (which is described below) and propose to continue and expand this work in the next funding cycle. The Center consists of 5 Cores: (1) the Administrative Core (Core A), (2) the Clinical Core (Core B), (3) the Data Management of Statistics Core (Core C), (4) the Neuropathology Core (Core D), and (5) the Outreach, Recruitment and Education Core (Core E). In this application we are proposing 3 new projects: (1) Project 1, to be led by Dr. Arnold Bakker (Assistant Professor of Psychiatry), will examine alterations in brain connectivity in MCI patients and subjects with subjective memory concerns vs. controls, and their relationship to AD CSF biomarkers. (2) Project 2, to be led by Dr. Philip Wong (Professor of Pathology and Neuroscience), will utilize a new mouse model of AD that closely mimics the human disease (by exhibiting both amyloidosis and tauopathy, and demonstrating neuronal loss) to test the hypothesis that amyloid induces tau aggregation to initiate synaptic dysfunction and promote loss of neurons.

The objective is to provide support for the annual IMGC meeting and scholarships for student and postdoctoral scholar attendance, particularly targeting URMs. Previous conferences have been highly successful at providing a forum for the mammalian and biomedical genetic community and a venue for student and postdoctoral scholars to present their research and interact with leaders in the mammalian genetics community. Substantial enhancements have been implemented for these conferences with the goal of improving the benefit of the IMGC to the broader mammalian genetics community and increasing participation by scientists in training. The improvements include sessions on large-scale resources and infrastructure, phenotyping for pre-clinical models, mentorship luncheons, and participation by scientists in training on the IMGS Secretariat. With recent discoveries in human genetic analysis now being translated to functional studies in relevant model systems, the importance of a meeting with a focus on the optimal utilization of these resources is clear."
"9559550","Abstract Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection is the most severe type of viral hepatitis, often causing accelerated liver damage that leads to end-stage liver disease. About 15?20 million individuals are infected by HDV worldwide. The absence of an effective treatment for acute forms of the disease and the limited efficacy of current treatments for the chronic infection justify novel strategies towards the development of anti-HDV therapeutics. The lack of HDV-encoded ?druggable? targets that are suitable for conventional therapeutic modalities such as small molecules and antibodies makes RNA interference an attractive alternative approach to target this virus. However, the highly structured, GC- rich circular genome of this smallest of RNA viruses make it a challenging target for RNA-targeting approaches such as RNAi. In Phase I of this project, we were able to identify inhibitors of HDV using SomaGenics' sshRNA® (synthetic small shRNAs) platform. These sshRNAs potently inhibit viral replication at multiple target sites in a cell culture infection model. The sshRNAs were then chemically modified to improve their drug-like properties. In Phase 2, we plan to move the program forward into preclinical studies using a transgenic mouse model that supports HDV infection. We will pursue dual approaches to delivery of our therapeutic sshRNAs to liver: formulation with lipid nanoparticles and use of a targeting ligand. Patterns of chemical modification will be optimized for each candidate delivery method to permit a careful comparison, and the most promising approach will be selected. Finally, combinations of sshRNAs will be assessed for ability to provide increased efficacy and forestall the development of resistance to therapy. By the end of Phase II, we expect to have established a cocktail of inhibitors ready for IND-enabling safety studies and then commencement of clinical studies."
"9458665","PROJECT SUMMARY {See instructions): This proposal applies a novel set of cognitive, neurobiological and molecular profiling approaches to the question of how to understand the concept of cognitive reserve in a rodent model of aging. An integrated set of experiments is proposed designed lo assess, mechanisms underlying differential cognitive trajectories observed over the lifespan of the rat at three different phases of the lifespan, young adult, middle age, and old. The experiments take advantage of technologies that cannot be used in humans at present, as well as those that can (such as cognitive tests and MRl imaging methods). These methods have not been applied in combination in the rodent previously, and involve high resolution MRl Imaging of the entire brain, cognitive tests that examine domains relevant to 8 brain regions in the temporal and frontal lobes (hippocampal regions CAI, CA3, dentate gyrus and the subiculum; temporal lobe regions perirhinal cortex and medial entorhinal cortex; frontal lobe regions anterior cingulate and prelimbic cortex), behavior-induced, single cell gene expression imaging in these 8 regions, and in 4 hippocampal subregions cell-specific whole transcriptome analyses. These procedures will be conducted in rats that are chosen on the basis of possessing behavioral performance scores that are high, average or low with respect to performance distributions from young, middle-aged and old rats. The present experiments have the potential to identify cell-specific RNA transcripts and behavior-activated circuits in brain regions that are critical for cognition, and that define how individuals segregate along a cognitive competence continuum throughout life. The combination of these methods will enable identification of those variables that are associated with more or less successful cognitive aging trajectories - a fundamental necessity if effective treatments are to be developed. The specific goals of this project are approached experimentally under two main aims. AIM 1 is to identify transcriptional patterns in hippocampal subregions that are associated with differential cognitive aptitudes across the lifespan. AIM 2 is to identify behavior-induced activity patterns in temporal and frontal lobe circuits associated with differential cognitive abilities, to identify what circuit characteristics are associated with successful cognitive outcomes during aging and the extent to which temporal and frontal lobes age independently. Together, the data collected in these experiments should identify targets useful in the development of strategies to optimize cognition during aging."

"9458529","ABSTRACT  Between 2000-2014, 50% of PhDs were awarded to Whites, 7.7% to African Americans, 5.4% to Hispanics and 0.7% to American Indians or Alaska Natives (NIGMS, 2011). The long-term goal of the proposed Summer Research Education Program (SREP) is to increase the number of students from underrepresented minority groups, individuals with disabilities and those from disadvantaged backgrounds into biomedical and behavioral science careers. The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW), The University of Texas Arlington (UTA), Southern Methodists University (SMU) and The University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) will carryout an approach that contrasts with traditional silo-institution summer programs. SREP will provide a network of diverse institutional cultures that will broaden access to: 1) resources (e.g. students, infrastructure and programs); 2) mentoring networks for applying to and making decisions of graduate schools; and 3) cutting-edge research experiences that complement the mission of NIDA. To address our objective, we have developed three aims as follows: Aim 1 Provide trainees an additional 10-week intensive research training experience for 10 Scholars interested in multi-disciplinary research aligned with NIDA's mission and strategic plan. Aim 2 Provide academic interventions considering multiple factors influencing trainees' persistence. Aim 3 Implement a mentee-mentor network beyond the Scholar's 10-week experience which will sustain the Scholars persistence along their career path. The expected impact is to be an established model where institutions share, develop and implement common best practices from lessons learned from SREP."
"9498301","Project Summary Erythropoiesis is the tightly regulated process by which red blood cells are formed from hematopoietic stem cells. Clinically, the only erythropoiesis-stimulating agents available for the treatment of anemia are the hormone erythropoietin (Epo), and glucocorticoids, leaving a gap where they are ineffective or contraindicated. In this inter-disciplinary project, we will use in vivo mouse models of erythropoietic stress, mouse genetics, and cutting-edge scRNA-Seq approaches to explore a largely uncharted area of non-Epo growth factor signaling and regulatory mechanisms in early erythroid progenitors. We will specifically focus on a potent new regulator that we have discovered: the cytokine IL-17, which we found stimulates both human and mouse erythroid progenitors, acting specifically through its receptor IL-17RA. We first identified IL17 as a novel erythropoietic regulator by overcoming an important technical challenge in studying erythropoiesis. Until recently, a major challenge in identifying novel erythropoietic regulators was a lack of information about the earliest stages of erythroid differentiation from stem cells. Early progenitors could only be defined retrospectively by their erythroid colony forming potential, namely ?burst? forming units and colony forming units [BFU-e(rythroid) and CFU-e respectively]. FACS-based schemes could enrich for BFU-e/ CFU-e, but not purify them. We have now, for the first time, prospectively isolated distinct early stages of erythropoiesis, guided by novel single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technology and using FACS. We found that these newly defined progenitors express multiple growth factor receptors that were not previously recognized as erythroid regulators, and we identified an erythropoietic regulatory role for the first three such growth-factor receptors that we tested, including IL-17. Our project is structured around three aims: we will determine IL-17 pathway components involved in erythropoietic control, the cell biological and transcriptional responses to IL-17 in erythroid and non-erythroid blood progenitors, and finally, we will investigate the ability of IL-17RA activation to modulate erythropoiesis in mice in stress and disease, including anemic conditions. In the process, we will apply scRNA-seq technology to reveal the dynamic structure of the hematopoietic/erythropoietic hierarchies in physiology, disease and during stress, and the sensitivity of these stem and progenitor cell hierarchies to IL-17 signaling."
"9448054","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the next 10 years nearly a quarter of the US population will be over the age of 65, and advanced age is the strongest risk factor for developing persistent post-operative cognitive declines (POCD). POCD is an array of cognitive impairments experienced following surgery and is thought to stem from increased neuroinflammation. Critically, persistent POCD is predictive of greater susceptibility to developing Alzheimer's disease, yet there is a fundamental gap in understanding the mechanisms underlying this devastating form of POCD. The long-term goal is to develop effective interventions to prevent and reverse this condition. The overall objective for this proposal is to determine the mechanisms that underlie aging-associated persistent POCD. A key oversight in models of POCD that fail to recapitulate the long-lasting POCD symptoms observed in older surgical patients is the pervasive use of morphine for pain management. Preliminary data here demonstrate that post-surgical morphine treatment in aged, but not young rats prolongs POCD to 4 weeks compared to 4 days without mor- phine. The central hypothesis is that aging and morphine synergize in response to surgery through joint activa- tion of the pattern recognition receptor TLR4 resulting in potentiated and protracted neuroinflammatory re- sponses, which inhibit key processes critical for forming long-term memories. This hypothesis has been formu- lated on the basis of two key premises. First, morphine activates TLR4 in the brain, thereby inducing neuroin- flammation. Second, aging is associated with exaggerated neuroinflammatory responses to challenges (e.g. surgery) due to a naturally occurring sensitization of microglia, which express TLR4. Guided by strong prelimi- nary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing 4 specific aims: 1) Characterize the neuroinflammatory re- sponse to surgery and morphine in young and aged rats, and determine the role of TLR4 in persistent POCD; 2) Determine the necessity and/or sufficiency of sensitized microglia in mediating long-lasting POCD; 3) De- termine the specific role of microglia in morphine-induced neuroinflammation; and 4) Characterize POCD in aged female rats. The approach is innovative due to its proposed use of a novel DREADD to selectively inhibit microglia. Furthermore, systematically examining the independent and combined effects of aging, surgery, and morphine, (and in aged female rats, estrogen depletion) on POCD has not been done before. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance understanding of the mechanisms underlying persis- tent POCD in the elderly, which has the potential to be clinically informative. For example, it may be that how elderly patients are treated for pain significantly enhances cognitive impairments, suggesting a shift to non- opioid analgesics or a combination treatment in which a TLR4 antagonist is added to mitigate morphine's un- desired effect. Ultimately such knowledge has the potential to slow, halt, or even reverse early POCD process- es that may be precursors to dementia, thus improving quality of life."
"9467421","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has organized and hosted an annual Cohort Studies Working Group meeting, Life Course Events in Aging, every year since 2002, with partial support from NIA since 2010. The workshops have brought together roughly 30 to 60 scholars with a common interest in the role of cumulative exposures in aging-related outcomes; and in understanding how the economic, institutional, and demographic context has changed for different cohorts and for different racial, ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic groups within cohorts. This application proposes to extend NIA support for this annual workshop for five additional years, from 2015 to 2019, with meetings alternating between the NBER's main offices in Cambridge, MA and the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles. NIA funds enable us to include in the workshop a larger and more inclusive participant group than would be possible with NBER resources alone. This larger group includes scholars engaged in aging-related research from numerous research universities throughout the United States, including most of the NIA-supported demography centers. It also includes researchers from other countries; researchers in academic disciplines other than economics (sociology, demography, epidemiology, clinical medicine, psychology, and public health); newer investigators developing or expanding their research agenda in aging; researchers with expertise in birth cohort or other long-term longitudinal studies in the US and abroad; and researchers developing new methodological tools for the study of longitudinal data sets. The funding requested from NIA will continue to supplement other NBER resources to support basic travel and accommodation expenses for workshop participants. This support is provided on the same basis for all participants, including both paper presenters and other attendees, engaging some of the most prominent scholars in the field in the activities of the workshop, regardless of whether they are presenting papers formally. All organizational costs of the workshop, all meeting expenses, and all group meals are covered with other NBER funds. By bringing together researchers from different fields, the Cohort Studies meetings provide opportunities for interaction and collaborative research across disciplines, potentially influencin the way they work. Researchers learn not just about new datasets, methodologies, and questions in life course events, but also have the opportunity for in-depth interactions with scholars from outside their field."
"9465468","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          This resubmission is comprised of three applications (Clinical and Data Coordinating Centers (CCC, DCC) and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Core). We propose to conduct a large (N=2100) simple, superiority trial in the US and Canada - BEST - comparing best open surgery to best endovascular revascularization to prevent mortality, limb-amputation or further revascularization in a target limb with critical limb ischemia (CLI), meeting the current mandate for assessing comparative effectiveness. Trial leadership is comprised of a closely integrated and highly experienced group of investigators based at a CCC (Brigham and Women's Hospital, BWH , Boston University Medical Center, BUMC, and Massachusetts Hospital, MGH, Boston, MA), a DCC (New England Research Institutes, Inc., Watertown, MA) and an Executive Committee of experts in the field. The Health Economics Group at BWH will work closely with the DCC to address assessment of quality of life and cost-effectiveness (C-E). The trial will be conducted at approximately 120 sites in the U.S. and Canada, builds upon prior feasibility data and endeavors to address limitations of current research in this area.  Peripheral artery disease prevalence is 15-20% over 70 years, with higher rates in smokers and diabetics. In the subset with CLI, 40% require limb amputation and annual mortality exceeds 20%. With the advent of endovascular techniques for revascularization, we demonstrate from our completed surveys that there is current equipoise among practitioners with respect to best therapy in the majority of CLI cases. The BEST trial will provide, for the first time, urgently needed clinical guidance for CLI management in the context of C-E by using: a pragmatic design, including a range of established techniques; a novel primary endpoint - MALE (major adverse limb event including limb amputation or major re-intervention, bypass graft/graft revision or thrombectomy/thrombolysis) - free survival; multi-disciplinary recruitment of vascular surgeons and interventional cardiologists and radiologists; and an innovative, cost-efficient C-E approach. Additional endpoints include other clinical event rates, functional status and QOL and C-E, all using standard definitions and instruments. 140 eligible centers in North America will be approached to ensure 120 are initiated and 80 sites each recruit 1 subject/month over 27 months accrual. Trial duration is 4.25 yrs - 2.25 yrs accrual and 2.0 yrs minimum follow-up. Two cohorts will be studied: All-Vein (N=1620) and Prosthetic Conduit (N=480). Within each cohort, the trial is stratified on 2 factors (4 strata): tissue loss vs. isolated rest pain and infrainguinl with/without significant infrapopliteal occlusive disease. In the All-Vein cohort, BEST has 85% power to detect an EVT vs. OPEN hazard ratio of 1.25 in the primary endpoint (MALE-free survival) with crossover rates accounted for, as well as 2% loss to follow-up. In the Prosthetic Conduit cohort, there is 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.70 for the primary endpoint. This resubmission fully addresses all prior reviewer concerns, to successfully and efficiently execute a trial that will provide important information for the CLI community."
"9483781","ABSTRACT Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder of undetermined etiology and without effective therapeutics. Recent advances in genomic approaches have led to the identification of over 65 ASD risk genes. Despite the genetic heterogeneity of ASD, several lines of evidence suggest that these genes share common molecular underpinnings. Therefore, we hypothesize that these genes will converge upon shared phenotypes when inhibited in model organisms and that these phenotypes will be the most central to the neuropathology of ASD. Identifying such convergent phenotypes requires a high-throughput system for modifying many ASD genes in parallel and assaying their effect(s) on embryonic brain development. Here we propose to leverage the diploid vertebrate tetrapod, Xenopus tropicalis, and the CRISPR/Cas9 system to identify convergent phenotypes among ASD genes during brain development. By injecting Cas9 protein and a single guide RNA (sgRNA) against an ASD gene at the two-cell stage, animals will be generated in which exactly half the body (separated by the midline) is mutant, allowing for direct comparison of mutant and control cells in the same animal. This will be performed for approximately 65 ASD risk genes, and the effects of ASD gene loss will be assayed by imaging neurons throughout embryogenesis using fluorescent reporters and by in situ RNA hybridization for neuronal cell fate specification markers. By employing fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), next generation RNA sequencing, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), convergent transcriptional signatures of ASD gene loss will be characterized. The biological pathways indicated by these convergent signatures will be validated through targeted manipulation of key genes. Importantly, the validated biological pathways may provide clues about the observed convergent phenotypes. By combining the high-throughput capability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and a tractable vertebrate model organism with a reliably-associated set of ASD genes, this study aims to understand the neuropathology of ASD at a critical developmental period, which should provide critical insights into the etiology of this disorder."
"9541820","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Evident by the current trajectory in care cost for Alzheimer?s disease (AD), there is a critical need for decreasing the rate of incidence of AD. This goal can be accomplished through mitigating the impact of known risk-factors for AD. Treatments can be used to decrease or even halt progression to dementia, but only if we invest in research aimed at understanding the mechanisms contributing to the increased risk of AD after specific events. Among these events, compelling evidence indicates that traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major risk factor for later development of Alzheimer?s disease, yet the mechanisms underscoring this increased risk are unknown. Understanding one putative mechanism linking TBI to increased risk of AD is the main scientific objective of the present research training project.  Synaptic dysfunction is one of the primary events causing the initial cognitive decline in AD, and recent evidence has shown that toxic oligomers of both amyloid beta (A?) and tau interact and bind to the synapse and disrupt memory function through converging synergistic mechanisms. Furthermore, through its role in synaptic health and function, alterations in insulin sensitivity have been shown to increase vulnerability of the synapse to the binding and disruptive effects of amyloid oligomers. Notably, our lab has found acute alterations in insulin receptor (IR) activation after TBI. This project will investigate alterations in insulin responsiveness at the IR level and in downstream elements after TBI at more chronic time points using biochemical techniques. This suggests a mechanism through which incidence of TBI would increase the risk of developing AD through increased synaptic vulnerability to toxic AD proteinaceous species which will also be evaluated here using electrophysiology and flow cytometry.  The extensive training that I will receive while completing this project will advance my knowledge in Alzheimer?s disease as well as traumatic brain injury. Completion of the training provided here will improve not only my research skills and experimental techniques but also my intellectually competency thereby preparing me for the next step in the pursuit of a future career as a PI at an academic institution."
"9522218","Project Summary Throughout history, placebo effects have been variously considered as tricks played upon the gullible by medical practitioners and powerful but mysterious healing forces. With the advent of direct measurements of human brain function, modern science has shown that placebo effects are neither of these. Rather, they reflect the principled impact of psychological and brain processes on diseases of the brain and body. Placebo effects represent an opportunity because they provide a window into internal brain processes that influence health, and a challenge because many clinical trials have now failed due to large and durable placebo responses, at great cost to health care providers and consumers. Definitive studies of the brain pathways involved in placebo responses?and the genetic, environmental, and neural factors that lead some individuals to respond more strongly than others?are critical to harnessing placebo effects, eliminating or controlling placebo responses in clinical trials, and understanding the psychological and brain factors that predispose one to successful treatment and ?spontaneous? improvement. Placebo analgesia is the best-studied type of placebo effect, with well-developed paradigms and preliminary data on its brain mechanisms. This background provides a foundation for larger-scale, definitive studies. In this project, we propose the first such large-scale study of brain mechanisms of placebo analgesia, combining neuroimaging, behavioral, and genetic approaches. It builds on 15 years? experience in PI Wager?s laboratory on fMRI and placebo analgesia and 40 years of genetics research at the Institute for Behavior Genetics (IBG) at the University of Colorado, Boulder. We will use fMRI to characterize the neural bases of placebo effects in 600 twins recruited from the Colorado Twin Sample and predict individual differences in placebo effects across two forms of pain. In Aim 1, we will develop models that predict the magnitude of individuals? placebo effects in pain and pain neurophysiology based on a) fMRI activity, b) brain structure, and a combination of personality, behavioral, and cognitive measures that can be deployed clinically. In Aim 2, we conduct the first analyses of heritability of placebo effects and their neural predictors, and genetic correlations that can identify brain features whose relationships with placebo effects are genetic in origin. In Aim 3, we leverage the >50,000 person Enhancing Neuro-Imaging Genetics through Meta-analysis (ENIGMA) consortium to identify genome-wide associations with placebo-linked brain features and develop polygenic risk scores for placebo effects. The research products from this endeavor will include data and models useful for characterizing and screening participants in clinical trials, assessing interactions between placebo responses and other treatments, and assessing placebo effects across disorders."
"9522441","A central policy assumption in the U.S. today is that expanding health insurance coverage will improve access to health care, improve health outcomes, and make each more equitable for all Americans. Despite its uncertain future, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, the most important legislation in health care since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid, holds great promise for reducing racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access and population health.  With the objective of evaluating the impact of the 2014 ACA coverage expansion on racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access, utilization, outcomes and quality, the proposed study has three foci. First, we will examine measures based on actual healthcare inpatient and emergency department (ED) utilization. Second, to better focus on Hispanics, the largest racial/ethnic minority with higher uninsurance rate (41%) than among non-Hispanic whites (15%), non-Hispanic blacks (21%) and Asians (26%), we will develop a near-national database by combining state inpatient discharge data from 22 states that together account for over 88 percent of the national Hispanic population; corresponding ED data is available from a subset of 13 states. Third, far from being an uniform intervention, ACA expansion engendered wide variation in implementation, particularly across states; we will evaluate how reform effects among Hispanics are modified by language barriers, national origin, baseline uninsurance, state Medicaid generosity, and provider availability.  To estimate changes associated with the 2014 ACA insurance expansion by race/ethnicity, we will use a difference-in-differences design, wherein pre-expansion (2010-2013) to post-expansion (2014-2017) changes in the study outcome measures are contrasted with those in a comparison cohort that experienced no insurance expansion. Our specific aims are to estimate the changes associated with ACA coverage expansion in rates of (1) ambulatory care sensitive condition admissions and ED visits, (2) major elective procedures, (3) inpatient mortality and 30-day readmission, and (4) use of safety-net hospitals vs. non- safety-net hospitals, and disparities in such rates by race/ethnicity. We will examine changes in outcomes among subgroups of Hispanics by English language proficiency, national origin, sex and socioeconomic status.  Our proposal has unique strengths: the data used represents a near-national population of Hispanics; it delineates impact across vulnerable subgroups of Hispanics; it identifies the role of potential facilitating and inhibiting factors, such as, provider availability and state Medicaid policy."
"9460464","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Repair of massive tendon defects occur in tens of thousands annually in the U.S. alone to restore the range of motion of involved joints. Autografts are the primary choice; however, donor site morbidity and limits in supply are significant issues. Allografts/xenografts may elicit immune response. Foreign body reaction to synthetic polymers is a significant drawback. Regenerative solutions expediting tendon repair, enabling earlier mobilization and reducing failure rates would be highly significant by reducing treatment costs. Tendon reconstruction faces multiple challenges due to the absence of a bioscaffold which unifies mechanical robustness, tenoinductivity and a form that enables integration to the repair site surgically. Supported in part by a R21 project, we developed a novel method to fabricate electrochemically aligned collagen (ELAC) threads whose fabric orientation, packing density and mechanical properties match those of the native tendon. ELAC induces tenogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) topographically and MSCs in woven scaffolds synthesize a matrix that is positive of collagen I and the tendon-specific tenomodulin molecule. ELAC is biocompatible in vivo and resolves into a tendon-like fibrous tissue. The degradation rate of ELAC matches the slow repair-rate of tendon. Therefore, ELAC is a unique bioactive and mechanically competent platform with the potential to repair tendon without the addition of growth factors. The proposed studies will test the hypothesis that the biomechanics of the tendon gap defects repaired by ELAC-based regenerative strategies will match or exceed that is attained by autografts. The first aim will optimize ELAC topography and in vitro conditioning processes to maximize tenogenesis of MSCs in woven ELAC scaffolds. Specifically, Sub-Aim 1.1 will study the roles of substrate compaction, alignment and stiffness in eliciting the observed tenogenic response. Marrow- derived MSCs will be seeded on textures of random vs. aligned, electrocompacted vs. gel form, and matrix stiffness values modulated over six orders of magnitude (1 kPa to 1000 MPa), a range coverage that is unique to ELAC. Sub Aim 1.2 studies will optimize cell seeding density and invoke mechanostimulation to assess effects of strain amplitude and strain rate towards further enhancement of tenogenesis in vitro. The second aim will improve the repair outcome on critical sized tendon defects by using woven ELAC scaffolds. A rabbit infraspinatus tendon defect model will be employed. The treatment groups will include autograft repair, ELAC scaffolds (with and without cells) and gap-defect as the negative control. Outcome measures will include repair biomechanics, types of de novo matrix molecules, inflammatory response and healing morphology. Elucidation of material-based and in vitro conditioning based cues in tenogenesis and in depth validation of its merits using the rabbit model will pave the way for a preclinical assessment of this novel biomaterial in large animal models. If ELAC performs at least as good as autografts the costs and morbidity associated with autografts will be eliminated. ELAC will benefit patients by restoring joint range of motion and by eliminating revision surgeries."
"9464552","?    DESCRIPTION: The patho-physiological hallmark of acute lung injury (ALI) is severe derangement the interface of blood with the endothelial vascular lining. Endothelial cells (ECs) exert protective mechanisms including those mediated by thrombomodulin (TM), which inhibits thrombin's pathological activities in part through the production of activated protein C (APC) from its plasma precursor, via interactions between TM, thrombin, protein C, APC and the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) which is located in close proximity to TM in the endothelial plasmalemma. In ALI, TM and EPCR are functionally suppressed. Replenishment of this endothelial mechanism is an important therapeutic goal, but infusion of recombinant APC and TM did not improve the outcome of ALI, because problematic delivery and inability to partner with natural regulatory molecules limited effectiveness and lead to adverse effects. To solve these problems we fused TM to a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of antibodies to PECAM, obtaining scFv/TM that provides protection superior to untargeted TM and APC in animal models of ALI. scFv/TM anchoring on endothelial cells in proximity to EPCR boosts protection. To circumvent the loss of endogenous EPCR typical of ALI, we use dual delivery of scFv/TM and scFv/EPCR, based on our recent serendipitous discovery of collaborative enhancement of endothelial binding of paired monoclonal antibodies directed to distinct PECAM epitopes. Here we will study the delivery, mechanisms and benefit/risk ratio of these fusions and embark on their clinical translation: Aim 1: Dual scFv/TM and scFv/EPCR targeting to endothelium. We will employ a combination of genetic and pharmacologic approaches to selectively modulate molecular regulation of the fusions in order to quantify their effects on ALI. Aim 2: Pre-clinical efficacy and safety in animals. Beneficial and adverse effects of anti-PECAM scFv/TM and scFv/EPCR will be characterized (vascular leakage, alveolar inflammatory response, morphologic and physiologic outcomes). Aim 3: Endothelial targeting scFv/TM in human lungs. To enable the clinical translation, we shall: A) Re-engineer the fusions using molecular elements applicable in humans; and, B) Study their targeting in isolated human lungs."
"9563305","Project Summary  Our primary objectives are 1) to extend the NLSY79 Young Adult (YA) data collection for youth ages 21 and over through the 2018 and 2020 data collection rounds and enhance this data collection with information on a) physical health and b) factors associated with both physical and mental/emotional health and well-being, 2) to improve usability of the YA data by creating additional public use variables in three primary areas (relationship history, employment, and environmental pollution exposure) and 3) to disseminate research results and study findings that specifically relate to the NLSY79 YAs to a broad audience, including YA respondents, using a variety of media. By 2020, these youth will represent almost 97 percent of children born to NLSY79 female respondents. The ongoing grant has provided funds for interviews with youth age 21 and over in 2012, 2014 and 2016.  With NICHD support, all NLSY79 children have received a variety of cognitive and socio-emotional assessments biennially since 1986. Young adults ages 15 and over were first interviewed in 1994 and were asked questions paralleling those asked of their mothers in their adolescent years. Interviews with the NLSY79 YAs ages 21 and over have been funded by a grant from NICHD since 2000, again including questions paralleling those asked of their mothers at the same ages. Linking the child data with a range of maternal, family and child attributes, behaviors and attitudes from the full NLSY79 life span has permitted researchers across multiple disciplines in the sciences and social sciences to carry out a range of programmatic and policy-relevant research. For many researchers, however, a critical issue concerns connections between developmental trajectories in childhood and adolescence and subsequent adult success, health and well-being. Extending this data collection through 2020 will enable researchers and policy analysts to explore both within- and cross- generational research topics of core interest to the scientific community, focused on adults through their 20s and 30s, and into their 40s.  The NLSY79 YA data set has other qualities relevant to public health. Data on health and environment have been collected on a contemporaneous and frequent basis, siblings and cousins are included, and blacks and Hispanics are overrepresented. Information has been collected on health from each child?s mother through childhood and from each YA since. YA health information can be connected with maternal health behaviors during adolescence and adulthood, and with pre- and post-natal behaviors. It additionally offers the opportunity to begin sorting out cross-generational transferences of illnesses such as diabetes and asthma. Collecting information in 2018 and 2020 on gender identity and sexual orientation, resiliency, loneliness and social isolation, self-worth, and social cognition will expand our understanding of both physical and mental/emotional health and well-being. Creating additional public use variables will help researchers navigate complicated skip patterns, permit comparison of research findings across studies, facilitate intergenerational comparisons and enable the public release of important health related environmental pollution information that could not be generated by anyone outside of CHRR.

"9529004","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular and metabolic diseases are among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the US. There are also substantial disparities in cardiometabolic health depending upon racial/ethnic background and sex that can be traced back to adolescence, the developmental period when youth begin to choose their own social environments and start to make decisions that impact their current and future health. While adolescent physical activity (PA), screen time (ST), and sleep duration are known modifiable behavioral determinants of cardiometabolic health, pubertal timing can also shape an adolescent's activity behaviors, directly through their own behavioral choices, but also indirectly through the behavioral choices of their friends. Therefore, a reduction in disparities in cardiometabolic risk between population subgroups may be achieved by identifying the early social, biological, and behavioral pathways that shape later-life health. The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the largest, most comprehensive longitudinal survey of adolescents ever undertaken, is an ideal dataset to test hypotheses about how adolescent social relationships and biological factors may interact to shape health as youth transition into adulthood. In the proposed research, we will use state-of-the-art statistical social network models that allow us to evaluate how the simultaneously changing structure of social relationships, changing friend activity behaviors, and pubertal timing within one's friendship group jointly shape adolescent activity behaviors as well as later-life cardiometabolic risk. An especially innovative aspect of this research is that we can use objectively-measured biomarker data in young adulthood to study the interaction of adolescent social network, biological, and behavioral precursors on later cardiometabolic health. Young adulthood represents an age when chronic illnesses begin to emerge, and when pre-disease pathways (indicated by objectively-measured hypertension, high sensitive C-reactive protein, cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin, and overweight/obesity) can be assessed to gain insight into the mechanisms by which social experiences influence future disease onset. With rich information on the contextual factors that shape human development and health, we can thus evaluate hypotheses regarding the joint importance of pubertal maturation, activity trajectories, and friends' pubertal maturation and activity trajectories on these markers of young adult cardiometabolic health. This proposal is responsive to PA-14-176 as research to identify: (1) social and biological mechanisms that promote positive sustainable health behaviors in children and youth, (2) contextual influences on lifelong health behaviors, and (3) sources of racial/ethnic and gender disparities in risk. Results from these secondary analyses in a nationally representative sample of 132 schools will allow us to adjudicate competing explanations for how adolescent social conditions are linked to adult health, identifying optimal network targets for a future intervention to reduce health disparities before the onset of chronic disease."
"9462941","ABSTRACT The overall aim of this application is to assess the role of the maternal and offspring genotype on the long-term impact of prenatal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on child growth and development through age 5 y. In order to achieve this, we propose to use information from the follow-up of a trial of prenatal DHA supplementation on child growth and development. This double-blind clinical trial, in which 1,094 pregnant women (18-35 y) who sought prenatal care at the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social General Hospital and related clinics in Cuernavaca, Mexico were randomized to receive either 400 mg of DHA or a placebo daily from mid pregnancy through delivery, was conducted between 2004 and 2005. A large body of information has been collected since including offspring anthropometric measurements at 5 different time points from birth to 5 y, as well as measures of global cognitive development at up to 3 different time points for over 80% of the life births (n=802/973). To this date the trial has resulted in heterogeneous effects on birth-weight and infant growth and global cognitive development, and more recently, a significant improvement in offspring's attention at 5 y. Besides the large pool of information available on child growth and development, we have information on maternal FADS genotype, which plays a key role in fatty acid metabolism and availability for the offspring at early stages, for approximately 700 mothers. For this analysis, we propose to use all the available data and assay the banked offspring biospecimens to demonstrate the role of both maternal and child FADS genotype on long-term growth and development within the context of a DHA supplementation RCT. We will use longitudinal data analysis techniques to assess the role of maternal and offspring Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and haplotypes in the FADS region, on determining growth and development at different stages from birth to 5y, and as modulators of a prenatal DHA supplementation intervention. This represents a unique opportunity to broaden our understanding of the role of genetics on the metabolism of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and its long-term impact on child development. Results from this study will potentially contribute to improve the design and targeting of DHA supplementation interventions and strengthen their public health impact."
"9502161","Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication ?adherability?, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this ?adherability? affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger?s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application."
"9581051","This is the resubmission of the competitive renewal of our RO1 that generated >63 publications over a 12-year funding period. Our goal is to assess the impact of dietary factors on chronic inflammation (INFL) profiles associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in treated and untreated SIV infections. As reported in other clinical conditions, diet plays a key role in modulating gut INFL, epithelial integrity and microbial translocation through shifts in microbiota metabolites, which may also induce excessive cell proliferation and activation or a skewed cell differentiation, resulting in a reduction of the immune cell subsets critical for gut health. Diet-induced changes in the host cellular fat and sugar metabolism may enhance SIV/HIV replication, reduce immune cell responses and promote cell senescence. Certain diets thus have the potential to enhance gut dysfunction during SIV/HIV infection. In addition to the impact on the gut, the diet-induced changes in microbiota may trigger changes in the adipose tissue that promote systemic INFL and induce liver damage that may associate abnormal clearance of microbial products, antiretroviral (ARV) metabolism and coagulation factor synthesis. Our hypothesis is therefore that, in the context of HIV/SIV, the diet?microbiota?metabolite axis has a critical impact on IA/INFL, response to ART and development of CVD. Long-term, perfectly controlled diet studies are very difficult to carry out in HIV+ infected subjects and can be confounded by numerous other factors (i.e., ART, age, alcohol, drugs, smoking, lack of physical activity) that may affect the same metabolic pathways. Our preliminary data show that administration of a high fat diet to SIV-infected NHPs induced alterations in the gut microbiota, MT, nonalcoholic fatty liver and increases in systemic IA/INFL, which altogether resulted in a significantly decreased survival. Based on these preliminary data and the rationales above, and as a logical continuation of the research from the previous funding periods, we designed this project, aimed at assessing the impact of major dietary components on the natural history of SIV infection and the development of SIV-related CVD in ART-naïve NHPs and chronically infected NHPs on ART. In an NHP model developed in our lab, that faithfully reproduces the CVD described in HIV+ subjects, we will perform controlled studies to test the long term effects of multiple diets prior and after SIV infection, on or off ART. These experiments will establish the pathways impacted by each dietary component and cannot be performed in HIV+ subjects due to the difficulty to maintain strict diets, the risks associated with certain diets that can produce harm, and to the impossibility to perform extensive invasive sampling. Our goal is to develop a permanent drug-free, no risk adjuvant therapy for HIV+ subjects, to reduce residual INFL, improve immune function and decrease the CV comorbidities. If successful, these highly translational experiments may improve clinical management and survival of HIV+ patients, without the risk of adding new drug interactions in this heavily medicated population."
"9462581","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to understand the signaling mechanisms by which eggs are activated to begin development. The current renewal application, for years 30-34, addresses the question of how luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary acts on the ovary to cause oocytes to progress to the stage at which they can be fertilized. Mammalian oocytes are stored in the ovary, arrested at meiotic prophase, for decades in women. Then in response to luteinizing hormone signaling in the surrounding follicle, meiosis resumes, and the mature egg is ovulated. Studies in mice have shown that meiotic arrest in antral follicles is maintained by cyclic GMP that is produced by the granulosa cells and diffuses into the oocyte through gap junctions; LH signaling decreases gap junction permeability and cGMP production by the granulosa cells, thus lowering cGMP in the oocyte. The cGMP decrease leads to the release of inhibition of the meiotic cell cycle. Despite knowledge of this cascade, many important questions still remain. This proposal focuses on the key event of the reduction in cGMP by investigating how LH signaling reduces the guanylyl cyclase activity of natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) (aims 1 and 2), and how LH signaling lowers cGMP through activity of cGMP phosphodiesterases (aim 3). Aim 1 will test whether LH signaling decreases NPR2 guanylyl cyclase activity by dephosphorylating NPR2 regulatory sites. Aim 2 will investigate how LH activation of G-proteins and the EGF receptor initiates the decrease in the guanylyl cyclase activity of NPR2. Aim 3 will investigate which cGMP phosphodiesterases function to lower cGMP in the follicle, and whether they are stimulated by LH. The methods to be used include isolation and culture of ovarian follicles and granulosa cells from mice and rats, confocal microscopy, immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, use of transgenic mice and specific enzyme inhibitors, use of optical sensors to measure cGMP and calcium in live ovarian follicles, and assays of enzyme activities in vitro. The conclusions reached from these studies will also be applicable to understanding the regulation of meiosis in women. In vitro oocyte maturation, in which LH receptor stimulation is performed in vitro, is an emerging component of methods for human in vitro fertilization, particularly for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and in combination with cryopreservation of ovarian tissue from cancer patients. The proposed studies will contribute to understanding of the biochemistry and cell biology underlying clinical advances in in vitro maturation."

"9482343","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Risk behaviors can threaten health and safety from both an individual and a public health perspective. They are associated with higher disability, mortality, and national healthcare costs. Among HIV+ individuals, some risk behaviors, such as unprotected sex and needle sharing, can lead to the spread of HIV disease. Other risk behaviors, such as substance use, can adversely affect health. Much of the current literature has focused on the association between psychosocial factors and engagement in risk behavior. However, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying these complex behaviors remain poorly understood. The prefrontal cortex and associated frontal white matter tracts in the brain that are involved in higher-order, complex neurocognitive processes, often referred to as executive functions, are likely to be involved. Building upon the extant literature, this study will test a novel neurocognitive model, investigating the specific executive functions driving risk behavior. This project will: 1) confirm that risk behaviors represent a unitary construct; 2) identify the underlying executive functions (i.e., attentional control, impulsivity, and reward learning) that predict risk behavior among HIV+ individuals; and 3) show that our novel executive functioning model predicts risk behavior even after accounting for the contributions of demographic and psychiatric factors (e.g., gender, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms).  Building on the applicant's solid foundation in neuropsychology and demonstrated potential for independent research, this SC2 grant will provide the protected research time and stable research infrastructure necessary to significantly accelerate her work in neuroAIDS. This project represents the first step in developing a track record of independent funding. The innovative research program that this applicant will establish has the potential to improve our understanding of brain-behavior relationships, particularly in HIV, and to inform more successful, cost-effective prevention and intervention efforts for risk behaviors."
"9473109","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study aims to conduct the first investigation of the neurobiological underpinnings of social communicative impairments, i.e., autistic traits (AT), in children with ADHD and ASD. AT, a key feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), occurs in 20-30% of children with ADHD. These children incur relatively elevated school failure and poor global functioning, highlighting the clinical significance of AT in children with ADHD (ADHD+AT). We aim to advance our understanding of AT across ADHD and ASD, applying state of the art brain imaging methodology as a first step in efforts to foster advances in treatment. Hypotheses emanate from the literature and our preliminary data. We aim to test that intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) between the fusiform face area (FFA) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) underpins AT across ASD and ADHD diagnoses. Specifically, we hypothesize: H1a: FFA-ACC iFC is reduced in children with ASD and in those with ADHD+AT, relative to children with ADHD but no AT (ADHD-AT); H1b: Across groups, weaker FFA-ACC iFC is associated with more severe AT. H2a: FFA-ACC iFC is positively associated with accuracy in emotion face recognition, and H2b: FFA-ACC iFC is significantly more related to accuracy on an emotion task than on a control non-emotion task. In addition, we will explore 1) similarities between R-fMRI and task-fMRI connectivity; 2) brain-behavior relationships beyond the FFA-ACC circuit, deriving whole-brain voxelwise R- fMRI metrics and iFC between regions-of-interest representing the `social brain'; 3) behavioral relations with structural connectivity indexed by fractional anisotroy, focusing on the inferior frontal occipital fasciculus, and other relevant tracts; and 4) data-drive approaches combining available clinical and imaging data to identify homogenous neurophenotypes regardless of diagnosis. Methods. We anticipate obtaining complete datasets from at least 70 children per group - ADHD+AT, ADHD-AT, and ASD (total N=210), group-matched for age, sex, full IQ, handedness and socioeconomic status. Assessments. A partial list includes: Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (administered blind to all other clinical data), K-SADS and ADI-R interviews, Parent and Teacher rating scales. The emotion face recognition task, and the holistic configural face processing task will assess emotion face processing; a Go-No Go task, and motion tracking will measure attention and motion. Brain-behavior analyses will rely on resting state fMRI (R-fMRI), structural, diffusion tensor imaging and task- fMRI (matching face task). Significance. The study informs the neurobiology of a shared phenotype, and will bring the field closer to a neural stratification of individuals with AT a critical step for developing neuroscientifically-informed treatments. Additionally, we will share unidentified data with National Database for Autism Research yearly to accelerate scientific progress."

"9530032","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the U.S. as well as the leading cause of health care cost. Hypertension is the leading remediable risk factor for CVD in the U.S. and globally, with prevalence of 29% in U.S. adults. Recent data from NHANES indicate that blood pressure (BP) is not controlled, defined as <140/90 mmHg, in 48% of individuals in the U.S. with hypertension. Strategies to improve hypertension control have focused on the physician-patient interaction at the office visit, system factors in the health care provider system, and extension beyond the traditionally defined health care system. All have had some success but are limited by not reaching individuals outside the clinical encounter or by challenges of scale, scope, and standardization of blood pressure measurement outside the clinical setting. Retail outlet BP devices have the potential to address these limitations by providing free BP measurements to individuals outside the clinical setting and at all times the retail outlet is open. These automated devices are standardized and linked to software with the ability to collect data and provide information to individuals using these devices, thereby providing a platform for an intervention strategy. Higi is a privately owned company that provides health kiosks in retail outlets. Higi presently has 11,588 kiosks in the U.S. with 4,125 in Rite Aid pharmacies. More than 45 million BP measurements per year are obtained at higi kiosks. In the one-year period 1/1/16 to 12/3`/16, approximately 830,700 individuals using higi kiosks recorded >3 systolic BP measurements >140/90 mmHg. We propose to target this group using interactive text messaging to activate individuals to take actions to improve BP control. The pilot studies proposed here will provide preliminary data to support an application to conduct a fully powered randomized trial comparing a tailored text messaging intervention to usual care. The primary endpoint will be BP control defined as <140/90 mmHg at 12 months post randomization. We propose to conduct a pilot study with the following specific aims: (1) Develop and pre-test the intervention text messages; (2) Pilot enrollment, consent, randomization, and data collection procedures at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months; document participation and completion rates in a pilot study of N=70/group; (3) Obtain demographic data on potentially eligible participants using an on-line questionnaire; (4) Pilot the text messaging intervention; document BP control rate in response to intervention; and (5) Pilot test secure data transfer and other data coordinating center functions. Potential for adaption is high because of alignment of retail outlets, kiosk providers, and consumers for health, wellness, and self-care."
"9520123","PROJECT 2: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Arsenic, benzene, trichloroethene (TCE), formaldehyde, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may have endocrine-disrupting effects at lower doses than those required for hematotoxicity or cancer induction. There is some evidence that they can modulate steroid hormone levels in both the corticosteroid and sex steroid pathways, potentially causing multiple adverse health effects. Here we propose to examine the disrupting effects of these common Superfund contaminants on glucocorticoid and sex steroid hormones and their tissue-specific effects in cell lines in vitro, mice in vivo, and perhaps most importantly in humans with well- characterized exposures. Endogenous cortisol is produced in response to stress and acts on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) triggering metabolic and other disruptions. Environmental chemicals can also impact the GR pathway and are defined as ?stressogens.? An example is arsenic, which alters GR signaling, but the mechanisms by which this impacts different cell types expressing GR are unclear. Cumulative risk assessment of non-genetic environmental stressors is a priority of EPA and we have developed novel approaches to do so under the exposome paradigm. Our first central hypothesis is that arsenic is a stressogen that alters GR activity, alone and in conjunction with other chemicals, with tissue-specific biological consequences. We propose to use an exposomic approach to understand the dose-dependent effects of arsenic, alone and in conjunction with other Superfund contaminants, on the glucocorticoid pathway in liver, adipocyte and blood cells in vitro; in mice in vivo; and in exposed humans (Aims 1-3). We will use a sensitive GR activity bioassay to screen Superfund contaminants that alter GR activity and will measure total glucocorticogenic (G) activity in media from exposed cells and in small volumes of human plasma from subjects exposed to arsenic. Use of the GR bioassay directly with plasma is novel. Our preliminary screening data show that arsenic is a GR antagonist and the PAH benzo(a)pyrene, an agonist. Arsenic, as well as TCE, benzene, formaldehyde and PAHs also cause adverse reproductive effects potentially by modulating natural estrogen and androgen sex hormones. Thus, our second central hypothesis is that these contaminants modulate estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) activity by altering natural sex hormone levels. We will screen chemical effects on the production of these hormones (steroidogenesis) in validated mammalian cell models, and total estrogenic (E) and androgenic (A) activity and endogenous hormone levels in plasma from exposed populations (Aims 4- 5). Our preliminary data show that TCE increases E but not A activity in exposed males probably through aromatase induction. Our overall goal is to understand the dose-dependent effects of key Superfund chemicals on steroid hormone pathways, to support comprehensive and cumulative risk assessment."
"9495223","Structural analysis of membrane-bound O-acyltransferases Abstract:  Membrane-bound O-acyltransferases (MBOATs) form a superfamily of membrane- embedded enzymes, which have 8-12 predicted transmembrane helices and catalyze the transfer of acyl groups to metabolites or secreted proteins. MBOATS are conserved from bacteria to human and play important roles in many biological processes. In human, MBOAT proteins catalyze acylation of some critical metabolites including diacylglycerol and cholesterol, and are responsible for lipid modification and maturation of secreted signaling proteins/peptides, including Wnt, hedgehog and ghrelin. In this project, we will focus on crystallographic and biochemical analysis of two MBOAT proteins: DltB that catalyzes D-alanylation of cell wall teichoic acid in Gram-positive bacteria, and porcupine (PORCN) that is responsible for palmitoylation of Wnt proteins. With our first MBOAT target, DltB, we have already obtained multiple crystal forms and solved the DltB crystal structure. We will complete and refine our DltB crystal structures, and aim to understand how DltB recognizes its cytoplasmic D-alanyl group donor protein DltC and extracellular acceptor lipoteichoic acid (LTA). This study will provide a paradigm for understanding MBOAT superfamily 3D structures and how MBOAT family members catalyze O-acyl transfer. It may also provide new insights into novel antibiotics development. With our second target, PORCN, we will reveal its 3D structure using a combination of X-ray crystallography, computational modeling and biochemical analysis. Wnt proteins play crucial roles in many important biological processes. PORCN activity is essential for Wnt secretion and Wnt signaling activity, and PORCN inhibitors are being evaluated in multiple anticancer clinical trials. Our work will lead to much-anticipated understanding of the molecular basis of PORCN-mediated Wnt palmitoylation, and provide structural basis for the development of highly potent PORCN inhibitors."

Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The distribution of underrepresented minorities who experience health disparities in Buffalo in 2015 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 35 years. The vision for our CTSA hub is to develop, test and share novel approaches to improve health and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a ?population of the future?. Improving health in our community and the nation will require innovative research across the full T1 through T4 translational spectrum. In 2012, the University at Buffalo opened the new 170,000 ft2 state-of-the-art Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) devoted entirely to clinical and translational research. The CTRC provides a centralized facility, including translational research laboratories, a clinical research center, an imaging center, a lab animal facility and a biorepository. The CTRC and other enormous BTC investments to build a 21st century Academic Health Center creates a setting for a CTSA to provide the key piece to transform our capacity to bring discoveries in the laboratory, the clinic and the community to benefit individual and public health by sharing expertise and innovative approaches to translational science as part of the national consortium. We will bring strengths to the CTSA consortium, including developing novel health informatics tools, leveraging our strength as a leading center on research in standards and ontologies; new approaches to community-based research developed with our community; testing and disseminating ontology-based methods to share translational image data; and one of the few full service Drug Development Services in the consortium.  With a CTSA we will 1) accelerate the development, implementation and dissemination of new healthcare interventions and their translation into the community through innovative research across the T1 through T4 spectrum, 2) train and develop an excellent and diverse workforce to ensure that translational researchers and their teams have the skills and knowledge to advance translation of discoveries, 3) build a translational science pipeline that integrates data from multiple sources and combines data analysis methods to discover diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive interventions, and 4) streamline clinical research processes with a focus on quality to enhance recruitment of special populations across the lifespan and groups with health disparities, and accelerate multi-site clinical trial initiation. Building on our unique strengths will enhance both our local and national CTSA network capacity through collaboration and sharing expertise and resources.

Acute ischemic stroke affects up to 700,000 people a year in the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death. Approximately 10% of acute ischemic stroke patients present with large vessel occlusion which are associated with high rates of long-term morbidity and mortality. As of 2015, mechanical thrombectomy became standard of care for treatment of acute ischemic stroke from large vessel occlusion. Since then, there has been a significant increase in the use of mechanical thrombectomy for acute stroke treatment. Despite high revascularization rates (~80%), 50% of stroke patients still experience poor neurological outcomes. In addition, 20% of patients are not successfully revascularized due to limitations of current revascularization technologies. Rates of clot fragmentation during mechanical thrombectomy are high with most patients having residual tiny distal emboli in the ischemic territory and up to 10% of patients developing emboli in previously unaffected vascular beds due to fragmentation during clot retrieval. High rates of clot fragmentation and failure to remove the clot resulting in poor neurological outcomes suggest that in order to further advance the field of stroke intervention, we must turn our attention to the science of clot. In this R01 program we will embark on a comprehensive study of the histological, physical and imaging characteristics of clot in acute ischemic stroke with the ultimate goal of studying the efficacy of various revascularization strategies on different clot phenoytpes so that care of acute ischemic stroke patients can be improved. We propose a methodical approach to the study of clot in stroke. Our first aim is to characterize the histological characteristics of clots from a large sample of acute ischemic stroke patients from multiple institutions. Data from this registry will then be used to 1) identify clot phenotypes which will be made for further in vitro study and 2) identify histologic characteristics that are more commonly present in clots prone to fragmentation or difficult to remove clots. Our second aim is to identify imaging biomarkers to identify difficult clots by performing in vitro imaging of the clot phenotypes identified in the first aim. Our third aim is to determine which revascularization techniques are associated with superior outcomes when treating each clot phenotype. This will be performed using an in vitro flow model which replicates the physiological conditions of acute ischemic stroke in humans. If successful, this translational research program will directly improve patient outcomes by helping the stroke community better identify difficult to treat clots and provide data on which revascularization techniques are best suited for clots which are prone to fragmentation or difficult to remove."
"9567340","Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and accounts for almost a third of all reported deaths, annually. The proposed cardiovascular sciences undergraduate training program provides an opportunity for minority and disadvantaged undergraduate students interested in cardiovascular sciences to receive training under the guidance of internationally recognized research mentors. The program will provide exposure to careers and will enhance student preparedness for biomedical research. This training grant will provide opportunities in several emphasis areas, including cardiac and vascular remodeling; molecular cardiology and stem cell research; cardiovascular toxicity of environmental pollutants; and vascular engineering and microcirculatory control. The goals of this training program will be achieved by a multidisciplinary approach that includes participating centers, institutes, schools, and members of the training faculty at the University of Louisville. The faculty will provide critical resources and expertise to perform cutting-edge basic science and clinical research.  We are submitting this proposal for an innovative summer research training program. This will serve as a platform for developing interdisciplinary and integrated approaches to elucidate mechanisms and develop new and innovative treatments for cardiovascular diseases. The proposed training program will support 8 undergraduate trainees, for a maximum appointment of two summers each. Students will be recruited nationally, but emphasis will continue to be placed on recruitment from regional Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The long-term objective of this renewal is to expand its initiatives to increase to 60% the number of participants, entering and completing biomedical majors, employment, post-baccalaureate programs and eventually matriculating into professional/graduate programs.  This program will address 3 specific aims: Aim 1: To recruit and train annually 8 undergraduate students in biomedical research methods through classroom and laboratory experiences. Aim 2: To provide innovative enrichment programming and initiatives to prepare underrepresented and disadvantaged students to successfully obtain a science related education that will lead them to graduate and professional pathways in the health, and biomedical sciences. Aim 3: To increase 40 to 60% the number of program participants entering into post-baccalaureate programs or careers in biomedicine and/or health."
"9459316","Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is one of the most prevalent muscular dystrophies. The majority of cases are associated with shortening of the D4Z4 repeat sequences on chromosome 4q (FSHD1) while mutations in the SMCHD1 transcriptional repressor gene were linked to a smaller subset of FSHD patients (FSHD2). Mutations in SMCHD1 also greatly exacerbate the phenotype of FSHD1, thus acting as a modifier of the disorder's severity in FSHD1. Abnormal expression of the DUX4 gene present in the D4Z4 repeats is linked to the development of both FSHD1 and FSHD2. However, only a small percentage of patient muscle cells express DUX4 protein, which can also occasionally be observed in muscle cells from unaffected individuals. This suggests that DUX4 expression alone may not be sufficient for FSHD development. Thus, exactly how the DUX4 gene is upregulated in patient muscle cells and how it contributes to FSHD pathogenesis need to be further investigated. Since D4Z4 repeats are not present in the mouse genome, patient muscle cells are essential for assessing FSHD-specific cellular changes. However, high variability among samples with only a small subset of cells expressing DUX4 may exacerbate the averaging artifact of population analysis (Simpson's paradox). Though single-cell transcriptome analysis should address this conundrum, ?single-cell capture? is not optimal for large multinucleated myotubes. Thus, we propose to perform single-nucleus sequencing to determine the extent of cellular heterogeneity and test if a small population of cells carries the disease signature and drives FSHD pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we plan to perform single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to determine the extent of transcriptome heterogeneity in control, FSHD1 and FSHD2 myoblasts before and after differentiation. In Aim 2, we will focus on comparative analysis of DUX4- expressing and non-expressing cells in FSHD1 and FSHD2 to determine DUX4-dependent and ?independent changes in two types of FSHD. The goal of this study, therefore, is to define DUX4-mediated pathogenic changes in patient muscle cells and to understand the extent of heterogeneity of patient cell population and capture the possible ?disease-driving? cells. The project should have direct impact on our understanding of FSHD biology and potential development of novel diagnostic/therapeutic strategies and optimization of patient care."
"9494194","A. Project Summary/Abstract: Next-Generation sequencing (NGS) has provided a wealth of data for research across many biomedical areas. The continued improvements to the technology will enable even greater depth of data which will provide answers to many critical scientific questions. This proposal is requesting the acquisition of an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system that will substantially enhance the DNA-sequencing capabilities in the Center for Biotechnology and Genomics (CBG) at Texas Tech University and beyond. The Center currently has an Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq 2500. The growing user base of the current instrumentation is studying a broad range of topics from prostate, brain and colon cancer, alcoholism, immunotherapy, Alzheimer disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, colitis, olfaction, vaccine development and ways to decrease antibiotic use. These researchers are from various campuses of the Texas Tech University system across the West Texas region. The CBG has served this broad regional base for almost thirty years and has formed strong and highly collaborative partnerships with researchers across many fields from the general academic campus and the health sciences campuses (Lubbock, Abilene, Amarillo, El Paso, and Permian Basin). The CBG is designed to provide researchers with the expertise, technology, and computational infrastructure from initial consultations regarding experimental design through sample preparation, sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. The CBG also provides hands-on technical training. The NovaSeq 6000 will add greater speed, depth of coverage, and greater efficiency of data production, thereby decreasing costs and ?time to data reception,? thus significantly impact the research efforts across the Texas Tech system and beyond. This instrument will enhance the ability of more researchers and young investigators to access tools that will enable them to address critical research questions better.CBG collaboration with the expertise and resources available in the TTU High-Performance Computing Center enables efficient storage, analysis, and dissemination of the big data sets produced by this instrument system. The technical support team at CBG has the necessary experience, and the Center has the administrative support for rapid implementation of this new instrument. This instrument will enhance the ability of the biomedical and basic sciences research community to obtain genomic, transcriptomic, microbiome and epigenetic data more rapidly at reduced cost, and expand the accessibility of these research tools to an even broader base. The NovaSeq 6000 will be utilized not only to greatly enhance research but also in education and outreach, maximizing the utility of this system to many stakeholders and promoting the overall goals of the University System and CH Foundation who support this proposal and committed $300,000 toward the acquisition of the NovaSeq 6000 DNS Sequencing System."
"9636761","The broad objectives of the Administrative Core (Core A) of the Atlantic Coast (AC) STI CRC are to  provide the infrastructure needed to help the Center meet its long-term goal of increased  understanding and improved control measures for chlamydia and gonorrhea infections. Dr. Ann  Jerse will be the Core Leader and a Core Manager will assist her in the running of the core. The  activities of Core A are organized around the following five specific aims and a management plan  has been developed to address each aim. Aim 1 is to foster interactive and synergistic interactions  between Center PIs, co-PIs and Core Leaders to maximize research accomplishments and  increase the types of significant breakthroughs that occur when experts in different fields work  together. Mechanisms to accomplish this goal include monthly teleconferences for Center  investigators and annual AC STI CRC meetings where Center PIs, coPIs and Core Leaders  present their progress. An outside scientific advisory board (SAB) composed of researchers with  diverse experience in STIs will attend two of the AC STI CRC meetings and provide critiques on the  progress of individual Research Projects, the Research Cores, and the overall Center. Aim 2 is to  provide funds, mentorship, and networking opportunities to talented new investigators working in  STI research through the Developmental Research Project (DRP) program. Core A will solicit calls  for applications and organize the review panel and review process by which awardees will be  selected. Core A will also play a role in developing a training plan for the awardee and will provide  DRP awardees with the opportunty to attend and present at an annual NIAID programmatic STI  CRC meeting. Aim 3 is to actively facilitate good communications between the Henry Jackson  Foundation, who will administer the awards and subawards of the Center, and administrative  personnel at the different institutions within the Center. In this way, the accounting responsibilities  of the center can be better discharged in an efficient and straightforward manner. Core A will  provide administrative oversight with respect to maintaining all assurances for animal and human  use. Aim 4 is to regularly communicate with NIH/NIAID program staff so that our progress is  transparent and we are aware of changes in programmatic focus. To promote these interactions,  NIAID program staff will be invited to the annual internal AC STI CRC meetings. Aim 5 is to  broaden networks within the STI research community by actively seeking and identifying potential  collaborations between Center researchers and investigators at other Centers. Besides helping to  identify such collaborations, Core A will consult with NIAID program staff for information on  expertises or technologies held by other Centers that might help PIs within our center."
"9456578","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accumulating evidence indicates that during normal aging, executive functions supported by the prefrontal cortex are among the earliest and most severely impaired cognitive abilities. Executive functions, which include attention, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, are essential to the successful guidance of adaptive behavior and to higher-order aspects of cognition such as decision making. Disruption of corticolimbic g- aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibitory circuits can have profound consequences for executive function, and preliminary data indicate that prefrontal cortical GABAergic systems are dysregulated in normal aging. Our long term goal is to understand how age-related alterations in forebrain inhibitory circuitry affect executive functions, and to identify potential therapeutic targets that can be exploited to improve cognition in aged individuals. Important to this goal, we have found that there are robust individual differences in the effects of normal aging on executive function, such that some aged subjects are impaired on an attentional set shifting test of cognitive flexibility whereas others are impaired on a delayed response test of working memory. Moreover, our preliminary data suggest that these distinct forms of executive dysfunction are linked to differences in patterns of GABAergic signaling. Building on our extensive preliminary data, the objective of this proposal is to determine how altered GABAergic signaling within the prefrontal cortex affects executive function and whether this signaling can be manipulated to attenuate age-related executive impairments. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in prefrontal cortical GABAergic signaling underlie distinct forms of executive dysfunction within aging populations. The rationale for the proposed work is that by understanding how altered inhibitory signaling in prefrontal cortex contributes to different forms of executive dysfunction, we will be well-positioned to begin to develop intervention strategies that will allow tailored and more efficacious treatments for executive decline that accompanies aging. Using an integrative approach in which we combine behavioral assays with molecular, electrophysiological, anatomical, and pharmacological studies in Fischer 344 rats, we will test our central hypothesis by: 1) determining if individual differences in prefrontal cortical GABAergic signaling contribute to different forms of age-related executive dysfunction; 2) determining if compromised regulation and activation of prefrontal cortical interneurons contributes to age-related executive dysfunction; and 3) determining if altered GABAergic signaling and executive dysfunction in aging contribute to impairments in decision making. We will employ an innovative approach which both considers individual differences and employs the evaluation of multiple subcomponents of executive function. The findings from the proposed studies will be significant because the information gained will provide foundational knowledge necessary to develop tailored treatments for remediating executive decline and promoting quality of life and independence across the full lifespan."
"9527578","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Heart failure (HF) is a rapidly growing health problem characterized by alterations in myocyte ion currents, Ca handling, contractile function and their neurohormonal regulation. Na dysregulation in HF is increasingly appreciated as a major, yet understudied aspect of cardiac function, linked to abnormal contraction, metabolic imbalance, and arrhythmia. By combining experimental and computational studies, this project aims to analyze quantitatively the contribution of various Na fluxes to the Na derangements in HF, and to link mechanistically intracellular Na dysregulation to mitochondrial function and cellular arrhythmias.  Quantitative systems models that integrate across interacting biochemical and biophysical functions are essential for a mechanistic understanding of a complex clinical syndrome such HF, which involves multiple interacting systems. Here, we will develop the first integrative rabbit ventricular modeling framework including descriptions of intracellular Na and Ca handling, biochemically detailed models of Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and ?-adrenergic signaling pathways, pH regulation, and mitochondrial function. The latter will be based on experimental data characterizing mitochondrial Ca handling and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rabbit ventricular myocytes. The comprehensive model will be validated against a broad set of experimental data, and used to investigate how Na, Ca, CaMKII, ROS, and ?-adrenergic signaling pathways contribute to (1) ionic remodeling in HF, (2) arrhythmia generation at the cellular level, and (3) metabolic imbalance. We will also test therapeutic approaches that target Na-related arrhythmias by specific inhibition of late Na current, CaMKII or ROS.  Our study will provide enhanced mathematical models of these systems and substantially inform the development of pharmacological strategies. Moreover, the proposed project will significantly contribute to the personal and professional growth of the applicant. The first phase will provide an invaluable training opportunity, which will enhance the applicant?s competitiveness for faculty positions. Indeed, the proposed research plan will allow for acquisition of a broad interdisciplinary background in cardiac physio-pathology, refinement of computational skills, and training in new experimental techniques (i.e., cell culture and transfection, and confocal microscopy experiments). Completion of this training, under the supervision of an established and highly multidisciplinary mentoring team, will allow the applicant to diversify research goals and methods from those of his mentors, laying the groundwork for the development of future independent research projects and proposals. Continuation of the support during the second phase of the project will ensure the kick- off of the applicant?s independent academic career."
"9459850","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a highly dynamic component of the developing -transcriptional control of the secreted skeleton. While the transcriptional control of ECM composition during skeletal development is intensively studied, the post-- components of the ECM and its regulators are relatively poorly understood. We have identified a novel class of regulator of secreted proteins, the first known secreted protein tyrosine kinase (VLK) that is essential for normal endochondral bone formation. We find that VLK phosphorylates a wide range of secreted proteins with established roles in skeletal development and maintenance of bone mass. VLK also phosphorylates resident ER proteins with specific roles in bone ECM secretion, and thus may modify secreted proteins not only directly, but also indirectly through control of the secretion process in -mediated phosphorylations both during endochondral ossification and during fracture endochondral cells. In this proposal, we plan to establish the functional role of VLK- repair. We will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to identify substrates for VLK in endochondral cells, identify spatial and temporal patterns of VLK mediated phosphorylations in vivo, establish how VLK modifies chondrocyte differentiation and endochondral ossification, and examine the function of VLK phosphorylation of specific secreted substrates. These studies will define a new mechanism for the regulation of ECM function in bone, providing a new approach to the therapeutic modulation of skeletal development, homeostasis, and repair."
"9445323","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The expression of GnRHRs is a critical, rate-limiting step in the reproductive process, however little is known about the mechanism behind the regulation of translation of GnRHR proteins. Gonadotrope functions may be limited in times of food deprivation, which is signaled by leptin deficiency, however there is a fundamental gap in understanding how leptin regulates gonadotropes. Leptin's importance to gonadotropes is highlighted by the infertile mouse model in which all isoforms of leptin receptors (LEPR) on gonadotropes are ablated, and the fact that the mutant gonadotropes have severely reduced GnRHR protein, but not mRNA levels. These findings provide important clues as to how leptin links fertility to metabolic status, however the molecular mechanisms underlying leptin control of gonadotropes are unknown. Our long-term goal is to fill this knowledge gap by identifying underlying mechanisms behind the infertility in the gonadotrope Lepr-null mutant mice. The central hypothesis to be tested is that loss of leptin signaling in gonadotropes prevents the normal diestrous upregulation of GnRH receptors causing a blunted or absent LH surge and infertility. A secondary hypothesis that leptin acts through posttranscriptional mechanisms to optimize gonadotrope function. The proposed studies will focus on three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will determine if loss of leptin signaling in gonadotropes reduces fertility through prevention of the diestrous upregulation of GnRHR protein levels. These studies will ascertain if the Lepr-null gonadotropes are held in persistent diestrus because of low GnRHR proteins and if the normal surge in serum gonadotropins is absent. The efficacy of exogenous GnRH in the rescue of GnRHR levels in mutants and restoration of cyclicity and fertility will be tested. Specific Aim 2 studies will determine if leptin signaling to mRNA translational control mechanisms is required for gonadotrope function. These studies will globally assess leptin regulation of gonadotrope mRNA translation and specifically address control of Gnrhr mRNA translation. Genetic knockdown of identified candidate translational repressors will be used to restore GnRHR expression in mutant gonadotropes. Specific Aim 3 studies will determine if food deprivation recapitulates the effect of loss of leptin signaling to gonadotropes, including repression of Gnrhr mRNA translation. These in vivo studies will test the hypothesis that loss of leptin signaling during food deprivation also prevents diestrous upregulation of GnRHR. The studies will also determine if the in vitro deletion of identified translational control mechanisms (e.g. MSI, miRNAs) alleviates the fasting-induced repression of Gnrhr mRNA translation. Our research is innovative because it investigates the novel concept that leptin may regulate gonadotrope function at post-transcriptional levels. These findings are significant because clinical protocols used in infertility treatments (e.g. clomiphene) depend on normal responses to endogenous GnRH, which we have shown depends on normal leptin signaling."
"9460369","PROJECT SUMMARY Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a disorder of the immune system that is characterized by autoantibody production, hyperactive B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling and B cell hyperresponsiveness; however, the mechanisms that regulate aberrant B cell function are poorly understood. Investigation of proteins and processes that drive BCR signaling, B cell hyperactivation and autoantibody production in SLE should offer mechanistic insights and lead to development of more effective therapies. B cell activation is kept under check by a potent inhibitory pathway, a key component of which is the Src family kinase Lyn. Human GWAS studies have shown a strong association between lower expression of Lyn and incidence of SLE. Mice with genetic deletion of Lyn lose peripheral tolerance and display all the symptoms associated with human SLE, including exacerbated BCR signaling, B cell hyperactivation, high levels of serum autoantibodies, and glomerulonephritis. Therefore, Lyn-/- mice represent a clinically relevant model to investigate the molecular regulation of B cell autoimmunity in SLE. We have previously reported that the membrane-cytoskeleton linker protein Ezrin regulates multiple facets of B cell function by undergoing dynamic phosphorylation- dephosphorylation. Interestingly, we observed that ezrin is hyperphosphorylated in Lyn-/- B cells, and that conditional deletion of ezrin in B cells of Lyn-/- mice leads to a significant decrease in B cell activation, differentiation, autoantibody production and immune complex deposition in the kidneys. Our data suggest that ezrin is an important mediator of B cell hyperactivation in the absence of Lyn, and thus a potential molecular target. We hypothesize that ezrin facilitates B cell pathogenesis in Lyn-/- mice by promoting molecular and cellular processes that rely on membrane-cytoskeletal reorganization. Our specific aims are, (1) to investigate the impact of ezrin deletion on immunopathology in vivo, (2) to determine the effect of ezrin deletion on B cell differentiation in vivo, and (3) to examine the effect of ezrin deletion on BCR organization and B cell activation in vitro. We will employ genetic, immunological, proteomic, molecular biology, and high-resolution live-cell imaging techniques to accomplish our aims. We expect that the results of these studies will identify the pathological features of SLE that are altered by loss of ezrin in Lyn-/- mice at different stages of disease progression, ascertain if ezrin promotes autoimmunity in Lyn-/- mice by enhancing germinal center B cell response, and reveal the spatial and molecular mechanisms employed by ezrin to facilitate hyperactive B cell responses in the absence of Lyn. Significance & Impact: We anticipate that the innovative mouse models and experimental analyses proposed here will establish ezrin-dependent membrane-cytoskeletal remodeling as a novel mode of regulating B cell autoimmunity arising from the deficiency of Lyn. Moreover, our results will inform the design of future studies assessing the role of ezrin in disease pathogenesis in other mouse models of SLE, as well as in SLE patients. Ultimately, our studies should lead to identification of new avenues for therapeutic development in SLE."
"9462126","The human lens must maintain transparency over many decades and, to do so without a blood supply, the lens maintains a fluid microcirculation system to deliver nutrients throughout the tissue. Recently, MRI imaging of water movement has revealed a barrier to water movement in the lens inner cortex that we hypothesize is an important feature of the microcirculation system. However, the molecular details of how this microcirculation system is established and maintained with age are not completely understood. Lens membrane proteins, such as transporters, channels and adhesion molecules, likely play essential roles in the development and maintenance of lens transparency via the microcirculation system. We hypothesize that lens aquaporins (AQPs) play important roles in generating the lens microcirculation system by generating regional differences in water permeability and by establishing an extracellular diffusion barrier. Aquaporin-0 (AQP0) is the most abundant lens membrane protein with reported roles in lens fiber cell adhesion, in water permeability, and in fiber cell organization and, as such, is vital for the development and maintenance of lens transparency. A second aquaporin, AQP5, is also present in lens fiber cells; however, its role in fiber cell function is unclear. The long-term goal of our research is to understand how lens protein modifications that occur during development, aging, and cataractogenesis lead to lens transparency or opacification. In the context of the microcirculation system, we hypothesize that posttranslational modifications and AQP-lipid interactions are important molecular mechanisms used to modulate AQP functionality in each lens region. In addition, we hypothesize that AQP5 trafficking is carefully controlled by posttranslational modification in response to mechanical or osmotic stress. To test our hypotheses we will employ water permeability and cell adhesion assays, native mass spectrometry and proteomics analyses, as well as multi-modal imaging methods to obtain a molecular level understanding of how the structures and functions of lens AQPs change in specific lens regions. We propose three region-specific aims: 1) in the outer cortex of human lenses, use mass spectrometry methods and functional assays to determine AQP structure, function, and regulation; 2) in the extracellular barrier region, use magnetic resonance imaging of lens water movement, super resolution microscopy to map extracellular space, imaging mass spectrometry to map changes to AQPs and lens lipids and functional assays top assess AQP function; and 3) in the core of human lenses, identify AQP modifications and determine the functional roles of modified AQP0 and AQP5. We expect to provide a new molecular level understanding of the lens microcirculation system and the roles of AQPs and their modifications in maintaining lens transparency."
"9464374","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to  applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure."
"9472349","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) are an important, yet often overlooked, component of fertility in animals from insects to mammals. Sfps have significant effects on the reproductive physiology of mated females, on storage and release of sperm inside females and, as recently shown in mice, on the phenotype of progeny. Male animals abnormal for specific Sfps are sterile or subfertile; evidence for this extends to humans. Some Sfps bind tightly to sperm; others remain in the seminal plasma and therefore are removed during some Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs). Yet despite their importance in reproduction, little is known about exactly how Sfps act to influence the female. This proposal combines genetic, physiological, evolutionary, and protein methodologies to address two pressing questions about Sfps' action: (1) How, precisely, do Sfps interact with the female to cause post- mating effects? (2) How do Sfps bind tightly to sperm and exert effects on sperm storage? We address these by using the experimental strengths of Drosophila, which we have established as a premier genetic model system with which to dissect Sfp function and whose Sfps have many molecular and phenomenological parallels to those of mammals. To address the first question, Aim 1 focuses on ovulin, a Drosophila Sfp that stimulates ovulation. Ovulin induces octopaminergic signaling, which in turn regulates muscle contraction in the reproductive tract, causing an increase in ovulation rate. We will identify the female's receptor for ovulin (OvR) by testing our candidate GPCRs for ovulation phenotypes upon knockdown, and for binding to ovulin in cultured cells. Then, using targeted knockdowns of OvR we will test the hypothesis that ovulin acts directly on the nervous system. We also will determine whether the proteolytic processing of ovulin that occurs when it enters the female enhances ovulin's activity and its binding to OvR. To address the mechanism and function of sperm-bound Sfps, Aim 2 focuses on the Drosophila sex peptide, SP. We recently defined a network of Sfps that binds SP to sperm. We will test whether male contributions are sufficient for SP's sperm binding, or whether females also contribute factors, by determining whether SP can bind to sperm in pure ejaculates. We will then identify the sperm protein that is required for SP binding. SP action is required to efficiently release sperm from storage. In the final part of Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that SP does so through the nervous system (and octopaminergic signaling) rather than by action within the sperm storage organs. Elucidating how Sfps interact with and affect the female at the molecular level is a very new area that is only now becoming amenable to study. Results of the proposed work are relevant to understanding and diagnosing Sfp-based infertilities and in considering strategies for ARTs, which may benefit from inclusion of critical Sfps. Additionally, understanding reproductive molecules in Dipteran insects will assist in strategies to control mosquitoes that transmit viruses that cause serious human diseases like dengue and malaria."
"9452906","Abstract: The treatment of large cartilage lesions is a difficult clinical problem for which there are few good solutions. Left untreated, these lesions tend to degenerate to chronic pain and osteoarthritis (OA), ultimately requiring a total joint replacement. For patients suffering from knee OA, and, in particular, unicompartmental OA, unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) is an available first line treatment option that provides many potential advantages over more common total knee replacement procedures. However, this approach remains controversial due to variable clinical results and high rates of revision associated with current implant designs. To overcome the pitfalls associated with current implant designs, we have developed a novel tissue engineering therapy for unicondylar resurfacing for knee OA. The overall goals of this study are two-fold: (Phase I) to repair large osteochondral defects in the knee, for which current treatment paradigms are currently contraindicated, and (Phase II) to resurface a diseased femoral condyle in an ovine model of unicompartmental OA. Our approach for both phases is based on a high-performance three-dimensionally (3D) woven scaffold that mimics the biomechanical properties of native articular cartilage at the initial time of cell seeding, thus providing a highly functional implant. Its unique woven architecture forms to the anatomical curvature of the condyle, provides an environment that encourages cell growth and differentiation, and is capable of integrating with subchondral bone. In Phase I, efficacy of the technology will be evaluated in a large, full-thickness cartilage defect located in the medial condyle of the knee. The following groups will be evaluated: 1) a defect only control group, 2) an acellular scaffold treatment group, 3) autologous mesenchyme derived stem cell (MSC)-seeded scaffold group, and 4) a tissue-engineered treatment group (ex vivo cultured scaffold with autologous MSCs). At 6 months, the regenerative response of all groups will be evaluated histologically and biomechanically. The most successful treatment will then be translated to Phase II where an anatomically condyle-shaped implant will be used to treat OA. All animals in Phase II will be evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months following repair. Functional measurements will be taken pre- and postoperatively to evaluate joint function and comfort, while sequential radiographs and MRI will be used to assess any morphological changes. Histological and biomechanical properties of the joint tissues collected from the treated joint will be compared to those from the contralateral limb (negative control) to quantify degradative changes. Serum, synovial fluid, and synovium will be analyzed for biomarkers of OA, as well as for adverse inflammatory reactions and to test for wear debris in the joint. This study will primarily provide valuable data on the ability of out technology to treat a range of cartilage pathology, ranging from large cartilaginous defects to unicompartmental OA. Secondarily, the findings of the study will provide insight into clinical, imaging, and serum/synovial fluid biomarkers that may provide additional information on the predictive validity of such measures in knee OA."
"9468255","Project Summary Heterozygous deletion of neurexin-1 (NRXN1), a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule, is strongly associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and psychosis. NRXN1 is highly alternatively spliced and recently a role for these splice isoforms in neuronal identity has been suggested; however, NRXN1 isoforms have not been characterized in human neurons. Animal models of NRXN1 deletion display deficits in behavior and neuronal activity. However, animal models cannot recapitulate the effect of myriad patient-specific deletions in the context of other risk variants within a patient?s genome; together, these effects likely influence the variable penetrance of NRXN1 deletions, which confer a diverse set of clinical diagnoses. Using hiPSC-neurons derived from a rare cohort of four psychosis patients carrying NRXN1 deletions, this proposal will investigate the casual contribution of these deletions on gene expression, alternative splicing and neuronal phenotypes in excitatory hiPSC-neurons. There are three aims: the first is identify differences in alternative splicing in NRXN1 deletion hiPSC-neurons, the second is to restore isoform deficiencies and manipulate NRXN1 expression in hiPSC-neurons, and the third is to establish the functional significance of NRXN1 deletion in hiPSC-neurons. My hypothesis is that excitatory hiPSC-neurons derived from four psychosis patients will exhibit differential expression of NRXN1 isoforms which are crucial for proper neuronal activity and morphology. We include strong preliminary data demonstrating the feasibility of our proposal; moreover, we have already observed that NRXN1 hiPSC-neurons express both wildtype and deleted allele variants. Our hope is that these experiments will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic risk for neuropsychiatric disorders."
"9667715","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The health/economic impacts of arboviral diseases transmitted by Aedes aegyti mosquitoes are escalating. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers dengue to be the fastest spreading mosquito-borne disease with now almost 4 billion people at risk of infection. In 2013, the estimated global burden of dengue was 390 million infections per year, with almost 100 million infections manifesting clinical disease. Further, the chikungunya virus, came to global attention in 2004 with epidemics on several Indian Ocean islands and the Zika virus emerged in epidemic fashion in the Western Pacific in 2013 and in Latin America in 2015. There is consensus that Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are the primary vectors of dengue, chikungunya and Zika. The Eliminate Dengue Program is an international research collaboration that is delivering a paradigm shift in the control of arboviral diseases transmitted by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. The method utilizes the bacterium Wolbachia, common in insect species but not present in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes until they were stably transinfected in the laboratory. In insects Wolbachia is maternally transmitted via the egg and rapidly enters into naïve mosquito populations in a self-sustaining, durable manner. Strikingly, the presence of Wolbachia in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes renders them more resistant to disseminated arbovirus infection, including Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya. There is an immediate need to design studies to test the efficacy of Wolbachia interventions in urban settings where cohort approaches are unrealistic due to ethical and logistic challenges associated with extensive continual disease monitoring. The difficulty of making evidence-based policy in relation to vector control has resulted in calls for improved trial methods. A field trial is planned from 2017?2020 in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, yielding data over the second half of this proposal period. We propose to study a variant of case-control design sampling, known as the test-negative design that has traditionally been used to assess the efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccines. Here we propose randomization of the intervention but in a cluster randomized fashion since intervention vector deployment must be done in contiguous areas. We need to assess properties of this design and also analytic techniques for the field data generated. Our proposed research will develop statistical methods for designing and analyzing cluster randomized test- negative studies. The methods will provide appropriate statistical tests and efficacy estimates, and inform future designs. Such methods are urgently needed to assess future Wolbachia efficacy trials in order to reduce human infections due to the dengue and Zika viruses."
"9687622","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a Prevention Research Center that uses community-based prevention marketing (CBPM) to adapt, implement, evaluate, and disseminate evidence-based approaches to strengthen state and local health departments' and community coalitions' capacity for sustained disease prevention and health promotion. The FPRC's health priority will be the reduction of cancer disparities, and the core research project for the next five years will focus on the promotion of colorectal cancer screening (CRCS). The FPRC's mission and core research are responsive to the Guide to Community Preventive Services' focus on multilevel interventions to increase screening for cancer. The core research project will focus on colorectal cancer (CRC), selected by our State partner - the Florida Department of Health (FDOH), because it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women in the U.S. While scientific cancer advances are occurring, racial ethnic minorities and the medically underserved have consistently experienced the highest CRC mortality rates. The aims of the core research project are to: 1) examine disparities in late stage colorectal cancer incidence and screening rates to identify priority populations; 2) identify appropriate and feasible evidence-based interventions (EBI) for the priority populations; 3) conduct formative research with priority populations and key stakeholders to assess the EBIs' acceptability and to tailor EBIs to better meet priority population(s)' preferences and needs; and 4) implement and evaluate the multilevel intervention and make recommendations for future programs and policies in the state of Florida. This proposal makes three significant contributions to prevention research. First, the FPRC will work with FDOH, a community committee and other stakeholders (e.g., American Cancer Society) to test the CBPM for Systems Change framework's ability to select, tailor, promote, monitor, evaluate, and disseminate EBIs to reduce colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) health disparities. This planning framework has the potential to equip prevention researchers, health department and community partners with an effective planning framework that accelerates the translation of research to practice. Lessons learned from this demonstration project will be used to enhance the FPRC's training website and provide technical assistance to other State health departments and community partners. Second, the FPRC and its partners will create a computer simulation model of the system in which CRCS disparities are embedded and identify evidence-based interventions appropriate for addressing determinants at multiple levels in that system. This model and formative research results will be used to design an integrated, multilevel intervention for reducing CRC disparities. The intervention will be evaluated and the feasibility of scaling it up to other communities assessed. A dissemination plan will be created for effective components. Third, the FPRC will use lessons learned from the new and previous demonstration projects to enhance the CBPM training website and mentor other public health agencies and community partners that adopt it."
"9455579","PROJECT SUMMARY Urinary incontinence is prevalent, morbid, and costly ($20 billion/year in 2000), especially for older adults who suffer from the most common type: urgency incontinence (UUI). Generally ascribed to 'bladder spasms' (detrusor overactivity), UUI's actual causes are unknown, and therapy remains inadequate with little improvement in the last 50 years. One of the most common reported forms of UI symptoms is situational incontinence, described as urgency and/or leakage when confronted with specific common situations, e.g. approaching the front door or doing dishes. Although well documented, it is difficult to assess and quantify, and is poorly studied. We believe that people who experience situational incontinence have a conditioned, Pavlovian response to environmental triggers or `cues'. Surveys have shown that `cue' scenarios are a major cause of urgency and leakage in UUI sufferers, but are not addressed by current therapies. Our recent studies have focused on brain control of the bladder, in particular how this control system fails in those with urgency incontinence. We would expect different brain mechanisms to fail and compensate in the setting of different types of urgency (i.e. urgency with different causes). We have succeeded in reproducing urgency and detrusor overactivity in response to photographs of personalized cue and safe scenarios. Thus, we should now be able to elicit situational urgency in an MRI scanner, and thereby ascertain the brain mechanisms involved. Understanding the brain's role in UUI is critical. We propose an exploratory study to investigate, for the first time, the role of the brain in cue-provoked urgency incontinence. Our transdisiplinary collaboration combining personalized cue development and functional MR imaging makes this possible. Our main aim is to recreate situational urgency in the MRI scanner while simultaneously recording brain activity during exposure to each participant's personalized urgency/leakage-provoking scenarios and 'safe' situations. This will allow us to further develop a basic model of how the brain reacts to situations that trigger urgency incontinence. Such understanding will complement our current working model of how the brain processes urgency resulting from bladder fullness without external stimuli. To accomplish our aims, we will recruit 25 women with situational urgency incontinence to identify situational triggers. All will undergo simultaneous urodynamics and fMRI scanning during exposure to their personal pictorial cue and safe scenarios. New knowledge about this significant contributor to UUI will allow development of therapeutic approaches to complement and enhance the efficacy of current UUI therapy and reduce symptom burden for many sufferers."
"9458081","The overall objective of this proposed R21 application is to conduct a secondary data analysis of the largest and most comprehensive population study (PINE Study) of US Chinese older adults to identify differential clusters of aging immigrants in terms of family relation patterns and to identify family relation pattern that is associated with favorable mental health outcomes. More specifically, using latent class analysis, a statistical tool that holds great potential, yet rarely used in family studies or among immigrant populations, this proposal addresses three specific aims: 1) Identify different patterns (latent classes) of family relations based on a combination of structural, associational, functional, affectional, and normative solidary; 2) Examine acculturation factors (length of residence in the US, age at migration, reasons for migration, levels of acculturation) that predict each pattern of family relations identified in Aim 1; 3) Identify family relation pattern that is associated with favorable mental health outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, loneliness, stress, and quality of life) of older adults.  Chinese is a rapidly growing but under-studied minority subpopulation in the U.S. with relatively high rates of mental health problems. As most aging immigrants, the well-being of Chinese older adults is intrinsically linked with their families due to cultural preferences, economic constraints, linguistic isolation, and limited access to formal services. Older immigrants and their families function in a fluid social environment. Family relations are reshaped in the acculturation process, resulting in divergent family experiences even within the same ethnic group. Our knowledge regarding such heterogeneities among older immigrants and their implications for mental health is essentially lacking. This marked research gap is further exacerbated by small, non-probability samples that have been used in most existing studies, as well as the use of a single- dimensional approach that focuses on discrete dimensions of family relations without considering underlying structures that may have shaped different dimensions. To address these gaps, we will use the two-wave panel data of the PINE (N > 2,700) to identify clusters of older adults who are at higher mental health risks by using a novel statistical model approach that provides a unified, comprehensive assessment of the multidimensional family relations, and by identifying the predictors of different family relation types, and the most ?optimal? family relation type that benefits mental health in the long run. The findings from this proposal will inform researchers, clinicians, social service providers, and policy makers to a) better identify at-risk older immigrants for targeted and tailored assessment and interventions, b) better understand the nature of ethnic aging and hard-to-measure family processes among older immigrants, c) develop new ways of research/practice to enhance successful aging of rapidly increasing immigrant populations through a refined family lens."
"9453728","PROJECT SUMMARY Young adulthood is the most common period of onset for schizophrenia. Early identification and receipt of comprehensive treatment during first episode psychosis (FEP) leads to improvements in recovery, outcome and relapse rates. Yet, US studies consistently find an average duration of untreated psychosis greater than one year. One critical barrier to identification and treatment for this vulnerable group may be the fragmented US health care system. Young adults typically have few resources and few paths to qualify for public programs that aid individuals in navigating the complex array of medical treatments and other services potentially available for individuals with SMI. Recent improvements in the evidence-base related to treatment for FEP and how best to deliver these treatments have the potential to lead to earlier detection and improved outcomes for this vulnerable population. Yet, it is not clear these changes in the evidence-base have diffused into clinical practice. Individuals with emerging mental health disorders may reap meaningful benefits from these changes, including shorter duration of untreated psychosis, more appropriate types and dose of medications, treatment by more appropriately qualified providers, support services and treatments for general medical conditions. In this study, by examining trends in outcomes among young adults of different ages, we aim to: Aim 1: Examine whether and how inpatient and emergency department treatment for young adults with psychosis has changed over time, and explore determinants of any changes; Aim 2: Examine whether and how re-admissions for hospital-based treatments for psychosis has changed over time, and explore determinants of any changes; Aim 3: Examine whether and how the rate of emergency department visits for likely suicide attempts among young adults with a diagnosis of psychosis has changed over time, and explore determinants of any changes. In addition, we aim to: Aim 4 (exploratory): Describe state and plan innovation in public program benefits for young adults with FEP. For aims 1-3, we will compare trends in outcomes among individuals of different ages and cohorts in various states using national and state data on hospital admissions and emergency department use. For aim 4 we will conduct qualitative interviews with representatives from states, providers and health plans to document innovations related to identification and treatment of vulnerable individuals with FEP and other emerging SMI. Psychosis strikes at a time when individuals are in school, entering the workforce, starting families, or making other choices with lifetime consequences. Recent scientific work offers opportunities to improve care for this vulnerable population, possibly resulting in lifetime increases in functioning. This work will be relevant to directors and other stakeholders interested in better understanding the benefits of providing more comprehensive and innovative services to individuals with emerging SMI."
"9462564","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal muscle wasting disease caused by the lack of dystrophin, which eventually leads to apoptosis of muscle cells and impaired muscle contractility. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) offer the potential to correct the DMD gene defect and create healthy cells for transplantation without causing immune activation. However, this requires engineering iPSCs to facilitate homing and engraftment into diseased muscle tissue without promoting tumorigenesis. Our long-term goal is to optimize the differentiation of iPSC into myogenic progenitor cells (MPC) that are directed to home into muscle tissue and engraft without undergoing unrestrained growth. Our central hypothesis is that precise MPC genetic engineering, coupled with targeted modification of the host muscle niche by preconditioning or exosome delivery, will boost homing and engraftment of donor iPSC-derived MPC via the SDF-CXCR4 axis to safely and effectively treat DMD. The rationale is to develop methodology to produce large quantities of functional MPC from patients with DMD that are tumor free and can effectively home to sites of muscle injury and facilitate repair. We plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives of this application by pursuing the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that iPSC-derived progenitor cells are effective and safe for regeneration of dystrophic muscle. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that activation of CXCR4 in iPSC-derived myogenic precursors from DMD mice using a CRISPR-on based genomic platform improves engraftment of donor cells in DMD mice. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that optimizing the regenerative microenvironment in muscle by ischemic preconditioning or iPSC-exosome-mediated delivery of SDF-1? protein enhances the homing and/or survival of donor MPC to augment muscle repair. These experiments have the potential to demonstrate that transplantation of iPSC-derived progenitors, coupled with methods to optimize the host muscle microenvironment, will more effectively ameliorate dystrophic pathology and improve the quality of life for patients with DMD."

"9462831","Susceptibility to sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is foremost modulated by APOE genotype. A single copy of the APOE ?4 allele endows a ~3 fold increase in AD risk, and 2 ?4 copies effect a ~15 fold increase, while an ?2 allele halves AD risk compared to ?3 homozygotes. Neither etiology of ?4 deleterious effect nor ?2 conferred protection is fully explained. Past work primarily focused on the role of apoE in A? deposition showed thatapoE in isoform-dependent fashion binds A? peptides, facilitates assembly of A? into  amyloid fibrils and promotes formation of parenchymal plaques and vascular deposits in the rank order of E4>>E3>E2, while the Apoe gene knockout in APP transgenic mice precludes formation of fibrillar A? deposits. In addition to the well-studied catalytic effect on fibrillization and deposition of A?, there is evidence of apoE isoform-specific effect on the clearance of A? from the brain extracellular (or interstitial) space, modulation of microglia inflammatory response, and regulation of synaptic plasticity and neuronal network function, which all may contribute to the differential effect of APOE genotype on AD susceptibility. Though relationship between APOE genotype and variable rate of A? clearance from the brain interstitial space is well recognized, how apoE isoforms differentially engage this process and whether it depends on direct apoE/A? binding remains disputed. Our preliminary microdialysis experiments indicate substantial degree of binding between apoE and A? in the brain interstitial fluid (ISF) of Tg2576 and PDAPP mice while application of specific apoE/A? antagonist, dramatically increases unbound A? level. Based on these data we hypothesize that apoE isoforms differentially bind A? in the ISF and that pharmacological targeting of the apoE/A? interaction may enhance A? clearance and prevent A? oligomerization. This hypothesis will be explored in Specific Aim I using APPSW/PS1dE9/apoE-TR mice (APP/E-TR) with targeted replacement (TR) of the mouse Apoe gene for various human APOE alleles and APP/E-/- mice subjected to various in vivo microdialysis experiments. Specific Aim II will investigate how APOE genotype influences inflammatory microglia response. Our preliminary studies show greater microglia activation in APP/E4 mice in response to A? deposition and anti-A? passive immunization than in APP/E2 and APP/E3 mice. We thus hypothesize that ineffective A? phagocytosis and deleterious microglia activation can be an independent mechanism of ?4 allele conferred susceptibility to AD. This hypothesis will be explored by functional phagocytosis and transcriptomics studies of primary CNS microglia isolated from apoE-TR and apoE-/- mice of various ages and from APP/E-TR and APP/E-/- mice. Transcriptome assessment will include RT-qPCR of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and unbiased RNA-Seq to identify signaling pathways differentially activated by apoE isoforms in microglia. Specific Aim III, using aged apoE-TR mice and APP/E-TR mice, will investigate how apoE isoforms in A?-independent and A?-dependent way modulate Reelin-Apoer2/Vldlr signaling, which regulates synaptic plasticity and neuronal network integrity."
"9444482","The general population is living longer, precipitating the need to better understand the effects of aging on organ structure and function. Impaired kidney function is more common in the elderly, and the incidence of ESRD is increasing disproportionately in people > 65yrs. The goal of this grant proposal is to identify novel mechanisms underlying changes in the aging kidney, with a focus on the glomerulus, in particular both glomerular epithelial cell types. Kidney aging is typified by a progressive depletion of podocytes, which directly underlies the development of glomerulosclerosis and reduced kidney function. Terminally differentiated epithelial cells, called podocytes (podo) are unable to adequately proliferate, and therefore cannot replace themselves. Recently a large and compelling literature shows that in young adult and middle-aged kidneys, a subpopulation of neighboring glomerular parietal epithelial cells (PECs) serves as adult podo progenitors. We recently reported that PECs are also affected by aging; characterized by a decrease in total PEC number, with subpopulations of the remaining cells becoming senescent or undergoing mesenchymal transformation. This grant proposal will study the existing problem of age-related podo depletion, but in a completely new context, by addressing major knowledge gaps of PEC progenitors in the aging kidney and their inability to adequately replenish podo. New approaches will include our recently developed dual PEC-podo reporter mice that individually label and lineage trace PECs and podos within the same glomerulus, the use of an inducible PEC progenitor reporter mouse, and the use of primary PECs in culture derived from reporter mice of advanced age. Aim 1 will establish when, and at what rate, PEC progenitor number decreases with advancing age, and will test the hypothesis that progressive cellular senescence is a major cause of reduced PEC progenitors with aging. We will prove that by lowering senescence, PEC progenitor number will be higher, accompanied by higher podocyte density. Aim 2 will prove that the self-renewal of PEC progenitors is lower in aged mice compared to young mice, both chronically over the life span of the animal, and acutely in response to an abrupt decline in podo number in experimental FSGS. Studies will test the hypothesis that aged PEC proliferation is reduced due to de novo increases of the cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p16, and that this is secondary to increased oxidative stress. Aim 3 will show that aged PEC progenitors have a lower transdifferentiation capacity towards a podo fate, and test the hypothesis that this is in part due to the reprogramming of a subset of aged PECs to a mesenchymal fate, thereby limiting their ability to transdifferentiate into adult podos. We anticipate that the results will provide compelling evidence and candidate mechanisms for a new paradigm that the biology and functional roles of PEC progenitors are markedly altered in aged kidneys thus, leading to their inability to replenish podos. These studies will provide evidence for important functional changes in glomerular epithelial cells, which underlie detrimental changes in aged kidneys."
"9463517","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this renewal application for a Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enable Dr. Ware to continue to build and expand her research and mentoring programs in patient-oriented research in ARDS. This award will allow her to continue to devote significant protected time to her current mentees as well as to expand her mentoring to include new postdoctoral trainees and medical students. In addition, the support of this award will allow Dr. Ware to expand the reach of her mentoring to include new efforts to enhance the mentoring skills of her mentees in order to assure strong mentoring for future generation of patient-oriented researchers. In addition, Dr. Ware's program in patient-oriented research will be expanded in new and novel directions. Specifically, she will focus on how release of cell-free hemoglobin, and genetic heterogeneity in haptoglobin, the primary endogenous scavenger of cell-free hemoglobin, determine the effects of cell-free hemoglobin on primary graft dysfunction, a form of ARDS, after lung transplantation. These studies are based on compelling preliminary data demonstrating that elevated pre-operative plasma levels of cell-free hemoglobin are strongly associated with development of primary graft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients and that the haptoglobin 2:2 genotype is associated with development of ARDS in severe sepsis. There are three specific aims. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that plasma cell-free hemoglobin levels are associated with risk of PGD in patients undergoing lung transplantation and that this relationship is modified by FiO2 at reperfusion. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that recipient haptoglobin 2:2 genotype is associated with a higher incidence of PGD after lung transplantation and that this relationship is modified by cell-free hemoglobin levels. Finally, Aim 3 will determine the mechanism by which cell-free hemoglobin potentiates the risk of primary graft dysfunction by quantifying biomarkers of lipid peroxidation, endothelial and lung epithelial injury and inflammation and testing their associations with pre- and post-operative cell-free hemoglobin levels and haptoglobin 2:2 genotype. These studies will lead to a better understanding of the influence of cell-free hemoglobin and haptoglobin genotypes on risk of primary graft dysfunction and may lead to improved donor selection criteria and donor-recipient matching. In addition, these studies may lead to new treatments for prevention and treatment of both primary graft dysfunction and non-transplant associated ARDS."
"9490656","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this training program is to prepare predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows with knowledge and skills to carry out cutting-edge alcohol research. For the past 30 years, the Alcohol Research Training Program at MUSC has created an environment where basic scientists and clinicians work together to train the next generation of alcohol researchers. The objectives of this training program are to: 1) integrate trainees into funded alcohol research programs with appropriate mentors, 2) provide general knowledge about alcohol abuse, alcoholism and alcohol treatment-related research, 3) provide trainees with exposure to appropriate role models, 4) provide training in issues related to scientific ethics, 5) enhance trainees?s oral and written communication skills, 6) teach trainees the appropriate use of statistical tools for data analysis, 7) teach trainees how to prepare research grant applications and to transition them to individual training fellowships, 8) give each trainee an appreciation of both clinical and basic science approaches to alcohol research, and 9) assist trainees in finding appropriate outplacement. Over the past decade, there has been outstanding growth and success of faculty devoted to alcohol research that has contributed to MUSC?s stature as a center for alcohol and substance-abuse research. This has generated a high demand for predoctoral and postdoctoral training in alcohol research. Thus, this application requests funds to continue this valuable program. Support is requested for four post-doctoral trainees and four pre-doctoral trainees. Seven major research areas are available for training: 1) elucidating the neural targets of alcohol action, 2) uncovering the neurobiological basis of excessive drinking, 3) analyzing brain imaging of human alcoholics, 4) determining the cognitive aspects of alcohol use and abuse, 5) evaluating novel pharmacotherapies for treating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, 6) analyzing how genetic polymorphisms contribute to alcohol abuse and treatment efficacy, and 7) studying the interactions of stress and interpersonal trauma in alcohol-use trajectories. Training will take place within a tightly integrated and physically connected environment where educational and research opportunities are closely coordinated. The comprehensive training program incorporates didactic material, clinical experiences and research opportunities. Recruitment and selection of trainees is accomplished by the Program Directors and Steering Committee members and by partnering with the College of Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs Office of MUSC who provide assistance in recruitment of under-represented individuals. Mentors are faculty with actively funded alcohol research projects and matching of trainees with mentors is by mutual consent. The NIAAA training program has been successful in placing trainees in highly-productive postdoctoral and faculty-level positions through which they continue to contribute to alcohol research."
"9463648","PROJECT SUMMARY  In 2003, we showed that the anterior pituitary hormone thyrotropin (a.k.a. TSH), hitherto known to promote thyroid hormone secretion, is a potent direct regulator of bone mass (Abe et al, Cell, 2003, PMID: 14567913)1. This finding underscored a potential role for low circulating TSH levels in causing the bone loss that has been recognized in patients with hyperthyroidism for over a century2, and, by tradition, has been attributed solely to thyroid hormone excess. We found instead that Tsh receptor-deficient Tshr-/- mice had profound osteoporosis, even when rendered euthyroid1. Importantly, we showed more recently that bone loss in Tshr-/- mice rendered hyperthyroid significantly exceeded that in wild type hyperthyroid mice (Baliram et al, J Clin Invest, 2012, PMID: 22996689)3 ? this finding not only confirmed a direct permissive action of Tshr deficiency on bone, but also buttressed multiple clinical studies showing a tight and highly reproducible correlation between low TSH levels, bone loss, and a high fracture risk in cohorts of hyperthyroid patients worldwide4-24. Furthermore, we found that the osteoclastogenic cytokine, Tnf?, was grossly elevated in Tshr-/- mice, and that its genetic deletion rescued the skeletal phenotype of Tshr deficiency (Hase et al, PNAS, 2006, PMID: 16908863; Sun et al, PNAS, 2013, PMID: 23716650)25,26. This led to the question: which cell ? osteoblast or osteoclast ? drives the effect, and which of the two Tnf receptors, Tnfrsf1a or Tnfrsf1b, mediate the action of Tnf? in Tshr deficiency? Specific Aim 1 will study mice in which the Tshr is deleted selectively in osteoblasts or osteoclasts, as well as double mutants in which both the Tshr and either Tnfrsf1a or Tnfrsf1b are deleted. Complementary co-culture experiments will determine if osteoblastic Tnf? mediates the hyper-resorption in Tshr-/- mice. A second corpus of data, confirmed by other groups27-33, showed that Tsh displays both anti- resorptive and anabolic actions1,34-37. For example, intermittent low dose Tsh injections restored the lost bone 7 months post-ovariectomy, importantly without elevating T4 levels (Sun et al, PNAS, 2008, PMID: 18332426)37. A follow-up question thus arises: is the Tshr a druggable target? Towards finding an answer, we will utilize both genetic and pharmacological approaches. In Specific Aim 2, we will examine whether high Tsh levels are anabolic using mice in which the expression of dominant-negative Tr??337 in the thyrotrope clamps Tsh at ~30-fold higher circulating levels. In Specific Aim 3, we will study the effects of a small molecule activator of the Tshr, MS438, which, we have found, binds Tshrs selectively and with a nanomolar affinity (Latif et al, Thyroid, 2015, PMID: 25333622)38. We also find that MS438 displays pro-osteoblastic and anti-osteoclastic actions in vitro, and does not elevate serum T4. We will thus inject mice with MS438 immediately (?prevention?) or 7-months following (?restoration?) ovariectomy to determine if it can prevent bone loss and/or restore the lost bone. Together, these studies should not only allow an in-depth understanding of Tsh action on bone, but also provide proof-of-concept for a new approach that targets the skeletal Tshr."
"9547209","There is increasing recognition that financial exploitation (FE) of older adults is a significant social problem that deserves the attention of researchers and policy makers.  With the aging of the baby boomer cohort who hold significant wealth and are increasingly using the internet and social media, scams and frauds are viewed as a rising threat to the economic security of older adults. Understanding factors that influence FE and financial capacity (FC) is also critically important to the identification of people with cognitive impairments such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer?s Disease (AD) as FC is highly vulnerable to the cognitive changes that accompany MCI and AD. However, prospective longitudinal studies of FE including detailed measures of cognitive function, financial skills/capacity, and psychosocial factors in ethnically and racially diverse samples are lacking.  The specific aims of this project are (1) to examine the impact of financial scam susceptibility (exposure and vulnerability) on incidence of financial exploitation (FE); (2) to examine the impact of socio-demographic factors (e.g., age, education) and social integration/isolation on scam susceptibility and FE; (3) to examine the impact of general cognitive abilities and financial skills/capacity (a) on scam susceptibility and FE; and (b) as mediators of relationships between socio-demographic factors, social integration/isolation, scam susceptibility and FE; and (4) To examine the impact of psychosocial factors (trust, impulsivity, and depression) on scam susceptibility and FE.  We present a conceptual model that describes hypothesized pathways to FE.  The study will use a prospective longitudinal panel design to explore FE in diverse community-dwelling populations over a two year period.  Telephone screening methods will be used to recruit a sample of 720 White, African-American and Hispanic adults age 60 and older (240 per group) from two sites (U. Pittsburgh; U. Miami).  Within each racial/ethnic subgroup, we will recruit 120 age 60-79, and 120 age 80 and older.  Three assessments (baseline, 12 mos., 24 mos.; final n~600; ~200/group with attrition) including a comprehensive cognitive battery, web-based banking simulation tasks, and web-based scam scenarios will be conducted by trained assessors, along with a standardized battery of self-report measures assessing experience of various types of frauds and scams (FE), financial skills/advice and support, sociodemographic factors, social integration/isolation, and psychosocial factors.  Examination of multiple pathways to FE among the oldest old and in large ethnically diverse samples in a longitudinal design; inclusion of detailed cognitive function, financial skills/advice and support, and psychosocial factors; use of simulations of ?real world? financial tasks and scam scenarios; and use of audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (A-CASI) to enhance privacy/reduce potential barriers to reporting FE are innovative.  Understanding multiple pathways to FE is important for detecting older adults who may be vulnerable to the onset of more generalized cognitive impairments like AD. Our findings will also help direct future assessment and intervention protocols."
"9525775","ABSTRACT Down syndrome (DS) is the most common non-lethal aneuploidy in humans, caused by complete or partial trisomy of chromosome 21. In addition to intellectual disability and atypical development often observed in DS, the prevalence of dementia is significantly higher, with onset at an earlier age than in the general population. A strong candidate mechanism is the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) gene which is located on chromosome 21 and triplicated in people with DS, giving rise to toxic amyloid peptides at an early age. Individuals with DS exhibit Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology and dementia early in life. The presence of AD pathology in younger individuals with DS is relatively unknown, due in part to a paucity of brain tissue available for study at earlier age epochs. Biomarkers that reflect AD pathology at earlier ages are thus of considerable interest since neuroprotective therapies will eventually target younger individuals with DS. Most cell types in the body, including neurons, release small endosomally-derived vesicles, known as exosomes. Exosomes contain proteins, messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) that play a prominent role in cellular signaling, removal of unwanted proteins, and transfer of cellular pathogens to other cells. Because of their small size, secreted exosomes diffuse into biological fluids (blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urine) and circulate in the interstitial space, both in the brain and the periphery. Neuronal exosomes have unique neuron-specific surface markers, which enable targeted examination from circulating biological fluids. We hypothesize that elevations of amyloid-beta (A?) peptides and phosphorylated-Tau (P-Tau) in neuronal exosomes may document preclinical AD in those with DS. In a recent manuscript, we demonstrated that neuronal exosome levels of A?1-42, P-T181-Tau and P-S396-Tau were significantly elevated in individuals with DS compared to age-matched controls at an early age. These early increases in A?1-42, P-T181-Tau, and P- S396-Tau in individuals with DS may provide a basis for early intervention as targeted treatments become available. We wish to continue these preliminary studies by examining AD biomarkers in exosomes in relationship to cognitive impairment and CSF biomarkers in participants with DS (Aim 1). Further, Tau protein aggregates into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that progressively spread to synaptically connected brain regions. A prion-like mechanism has been suggested: misfolded Tau propagating through the brain seeds neurotoxic aggregation of soluble Tau in recipient neurons. In Aim 2 of this application, we will perform seeding experiments using exosomes from patients with DS and DS-AD injected into the brain of a DS mouse model, to determine seeding capacity of Tau species produced in the brain of those with DS. These studies will lead to more information regarding validity of exosome biomarkers to predict conversion to dementia in DS, and will also provide novel information regarding mechanistic effects of toxic Tau species in the DS brain."
"9663639","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is a major health concern, with over 200,000 new diagnoses rendered each year in the United States. Approximately 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer; thus, substantial effort has been directed at defining the basis of tumor development and progression. Breast cancer is represented by multiple disease- subtypes which are distinguished by differential markers, prognoses, and treatment regimens. In general, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Her 2 negative disease (ie. triple negative breast cancer-TNBC) is faster progressing and more difficult to treat. Genetic analyses have established that specific tumor suppressor pathways are differentially disrupted in ER-negative disease, but the specific relevance of these events for tumor behavior or therapeutic response remains unclear. Here, we will delineate the coordinate role of RB-tumor suppressive pathway in the progression to ER-negative disease and the treatment of such tumors based on rational drug delivery. Two major areas of preliminary investigation support the rationale and hypothesis of the proposal: First, preliminary and independently published data demonstrate that loss of RB gene, and/or inactivation of the RB-pathway occurs at high frequency in basal ER-negative breast cancer. Supporting this contention, preliminary analyses of ductal carcinoma in situ lesions demonstrate that RB- pathway alterations are observed early in ER-negative disease. Furthermore, models of RB deletion exhibit molecular signatures indicative of basal ER-negative breast cancer. Thus, we will characterize the impact of RB-pathway on the behavior of pre-invasive lesions, underlying prognosis, and additional genetic events associated with progression to invasive cancer (Aim 1). Second, we observed in multiple preclinical models that loss of RB increases sensitivity to cytotoxic therapies. Subsequent independent analyses of ER-negative clinical specimens demonstrated that loss of RB is associated with an improved response to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Given the frequency of RB loss in human disease, it is essential to define the impact of RB status for the molecular and cellular consequence response to therapy and define new regimens to specifically exploit the vulnerabilities encoded with the loss of RB (Aim 2). Collectively, the studies proposed herein will test the hypothesis that the RB-pathway plays a critical role in modulating disease progression and therapeutic response in triple negative breast cancer that could be rationally targeted."
"9645877","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the deadliest cancers and cure rates have not improved for four decades. Patients with poor risk cytogenetics have 0-5 % survival at 2-3 years and only 40% to 50% of older patients achieve a complete remission to upfront therapy. Cytarabine (AraC) has been the most active single agent in AML therapy, however the majority of patients still relapse and die of refractory disease. The ability o circumvent AraC resistance would be crucial in improving initial responses and preventing resistance and relapse. In RNAi screens we identified CHEK1 and WEE1 kinases as the two most potent sensitizers to AraC. CHEK1 and WEE1 have complementary functions as sensors and downstream effectors of DNA damage signals, resulting in G2/M and S-Phase checkpoint activation with cell cycle arrest. A Phase 1 trials of AraC plus the CHEK1 inhibitor MK8776 in AML was completed and showed a remarkable 33% complete remission (even higher at higher MK8776 doses) and 50% overall response rate in highly relapsed and refractory AML patients indicating that CHEK1 inhibition combined with AraC could overcome chemoresistance in AML cells. We are co-leading a follow up study, a CTEP randomized Phase 2 trial of AraC versus AraC + MK8776 (CHEK1 inhibitor) in 99 AML patients. It will now be crucial to identify those patients responding to AraC + MK8776 and we propose to develop biomarkers that will correlate with sensitivity or resistance to AraC + MK8776 in AML patients. For this goal we will build on our previous successful biomarker results from another trial in which expression of a panel of DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint proteins predicted response to a CHEK1-G2/M checkpoint targeting drug in combination with the DNA damaging agent cisplatin. These proteins enriched with additional CHEK1 and WEE1 effectors will be analyzed in samples from patients treated on the Phase 1 and 2 trial of AraC + MK8776 to develop predictive biomarkers of response to the combination. Given the complementary functions of CHEK1 and WEE1 we will further characterize the therapeutic potential of complete cell cycle checkpoint and DNA repair inhibition with the small molecule CHEK1 and WEE1 inhibitors MK8776 and MK1775, in vitro and ex vivo in primary AML patient samples. Successful results will support a clinical trial f these novel non-cytotoxic drugs. Finally to identify completely new targets and molecular vulnerabilities in AML we will conduct the first High-throughput RNA interference sensitizer screen with AraC and the Anthracycline Daunorubicin to inform novel combination strategies and regimens for AML induction therapy as well as to develop predictive biomarkers of response to induction therapy."
"9458698","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The skeletal dysplasias (SDs) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders associated with abnormalities in the skeleton that lead to long-term physical disabilities in survivors and lethal skeletal abnormalities in some cases. Over the last 30 years, we have collected material on more than 18,000 skeletal dysplasia cases, more than half presenting to various degrees in the prenatal period. This project is aimed at defining the ultrasound, clinical, histologic, molecular, and pathophysiologic features of novel or poorly delineated prenatal onset skeletal disorders. The goals of this project are to define and solve the molecular basis of these disorders, thereby increasing our knowledge of skeletal development and biology and improving our understanding of the mechanisms and developmental course of prenatal onset skeletal dysplasias. We will achieve these goals through the following Specific Aims: 1. Define and characterize novel skeletal dysplasias. Using the large number of previously ascertained cases, we have determined that approximately 10% of prenatal onset skeletal dysplasias cannot be assigned a specific diagnosis. We will take advantage of this unique resource of unclassified cases by defining novel prenatal onset skeletal disorders. We will first concentrate on phenotyping and classifying poorly defined, yet frequently encountered, disorders with the findings of bent bones and multiple vertebral segmentation defects. 2. Identify the underlying genetic basis of novel skeletal dysplasias. This Aim will capitalize on the availability of DNA for the disorders defined in Aim 1 and will use exome sequencing as the primary approach to identifying their genetic basis. The exome sequencing data will be filtered based on the pattern of inheritance, loci identified by homozygosity mapping in selected cases of recessive disorders with parental consanguinity, and gene expression in the target tissues, growth plate cartilage and perichondrium/periosteum. For the perichondrium/periosteum, our preliminary data on bent bone disorders have identified an important yet unappreciated role for the effects of genes expressed in perichondrium/periosteum on skeletal development. It is thus our expectation that many of the bent bone disorders that we will characterize, define and solve will result from genes with high expression in this region of the developing skeleton. Identifying the molecular defect in these understudied disorders, will be complemented by experiments aimed at determining their pathogenetic mechanisms, and will provide molecular, histologic and clinical structures within which to understand and classify this diverse group of disorders. The expected outcomes of the proposed work will improve our understanding of currently poorly delineated prenatal onset skeletal disorders. Of medical importance to the general population, discovering the genes and pathways in these prenatal onset genetic skeletal dysplasias will identify previously unknown mechanisms and pathways involved in normal growth, bone and cartilage homeostasis and the development of arthritis and osteoporosis, thus providing essential data for developing rational clinical care and treatment paradigms."
"9520117","Center Summary/Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is escalating in California and the United States and is associated with the rising obesity epidemic. NAFLD is a hepatic phenotype that encompasses the more serious manifestation of steatohepatitis (NASH), considered to be a prerequisite for liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma/HCC). We also know from recent clinical studies that chemical toxicant exposure, in the absence of obesity, can lead to toxicant-associated steatohepatitis (TASH), which closely resembles the pathology of NASH. These findings are relevant to SRP stakeholders in Region 9, since California ranks high in National Priorities List (Superfund sites) nationally and contains thousands of additional hazardous waste sites (HWS). In addition, the UCSD NAFLD Research Center shows that American Indians and Hispanics, combined the largest non-Caucasian population in California, are at far greater risk of developing NAFLD. Over the past five years, our SRC has leveraged resources to demonstrate that TASH is greatly accelerated by consumption of high-fat diet (HFD) or after a diabetic episode in mice. These findings are relevant, since we can speculate that American Indians and Hispanics are more susceptible to TASH development, a risk amplified by unhealthy diets, poverty and health disparities. The UCSD SRC will be developing models through its Biomedical projects to characterize the mechanisms of Superfund toxicant induced TASH development and cancer, while the Environmental Science & Engineering (ES&E) projects will develop tools for NPL-toxicant detection and remediation. Biomedical and ES&E projects will be assisted in these efforts by Research Core services that will provide tools for mouse genetic production, metabolomic and sophisticated Bioinformatic analysis. A key objective of the projects is to highlight scientific findings to maximize Research Translation, which will happen with collaborations between the projects and the Research Translation Core. We believe our program is innovative and paradigm shifting, since it has the potential of linking important basic research findings regarding Superfund toxicant exposure with human disease biomarker identification through collaborations with the UCSD NAFLD Research Center, which contains one of the largest NALFD cohort studies in the world. Importantly, our Biomedical findings and tools developed in the ES&E projects will be used as resources and knowledge gained to reduce cumulative impacts and health disparities. These initiatives will be leveraged through Community Engagement Core efforts in disadvantaged Hispanic neighborhoods in San Diego and Mexico where statistics confirms that obesity is an escalating problem both in children and adults. Since the incidence of NAFLD and liver cirrhosis is on the rise in both children and adults and may be linked to toxicant chemical exposure, our findings will be communicated to SRP primary stakeholders at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, in addition to state and local agencies."
"9520121","CORE E: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Center investigators seek to understand potential health risks posed by complex exposure scenarios present at hazardous waste sites, using a novel `seeing the whole picture' exposomic approach. Several of the proposed projects will use cutting-edge analytical chemistry, sequencing and other approaches to produce high-dimensional ?omic? data with thousands of parallel measurements on a specific endpoint. These data will be analyzed to identify biological processes that are perturbed in complex environmental exposure scenarios. Several projects will rely on a carefully maintained biorepository of mammalian cell lines and biospecimens from human populations exposed to arsenic, benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethene, and benzo(a)pyrene. The Data Science and Laboratory Core (Core E) will support the data science, analytical chemistry and biospecimen processing and storage needs of the Center and is critical to the success of the program. Specifically, the Data Science component will support the acquisition, storage, analysis, and sharing of large, complex datasets through the development of tools, infrastructure and expertise. It will develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to find patterns in high-dimensional data sets in order to understand biological perturbations and potential health risks associated with exposures. As these methods require a lot of computing power, existing powerful Linux servers will be adapted to host and analyze the data. Core E leaders will work with the Berkeley Research Computing group to develop ways to annotate and share the data and analysis protocols with the project leaders and ultimately the greater scientific community. The Laboratory component will support the processing, storage and management of human biospecimens and cell lines, leveraging years of expertise in this area. It will innovatively connect with the Community Engagement Core B (CEC) to advise on the development of study protocols and to analyze arsenic, nitrate, chromium, pesticides, and chlorinated hydrocarbons in water samples, for the pilot Domestic Well Intervention Study of the CEC. By leveraging expertise from the research projects, the Laboratory component will enable the CEC and the Center as a whole to respond to community issues and needs, and pursue interventions to improve drinking water quality for affected communities. In conclusion, Core E is an integral and critical component of the overall program that supports the data science and laboratory needs of all projects and the CEC."
"9476789","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) is poised to have significant impact in biomedical and bio behavioral research (BBR) both regionally and nationally. SIUE has a unique mix of healthcare and associated disciplines that are not similarly represented in universities in the metropolitan St. Louis and southern Illinois regions and offers nearly 20 graduate and professional degrees in the biomedical and behavioral fields. The goal of the proposed project is to increase the quality and quantity of support for BBR, resulting in SIUE faculty submitting a greater number of and more competitive proposals for external funding and more faculty and students from underrepresented groups (URG) participating in BBR. SIUE will implement strategies for strengthening research administration support through the following three specific aims. 1. Improve pre-award and compliance services in the areas of BBR by:  1.1. Adding a staff member specifically trained to support BBR to the pre-award staff of ORP 1.2. Expanding the overall knowledge base of pre-award research administration staff in BBR projects 1.3. Developing expanded ORP support services and tools to increase the efficiency of grant administration 2. Increase the interaction o faculty with interest in BBR to increase research collaborations. 3. Increase involvement of URG in BBR activities by:  3.1. Leveraging current internal programs to increase support to students and faculty of URG 3.2. Leveraging current and instituting new mentoring opportunities for faculty and graduate students. These aims will increase the ability of the Office of Research and Projects (ORP) to assist with pre-award, post-award, and compliance issues; increase the number of faculty pursuing external support for BBR; as well as facilitate collaboration across disciplines and between faculty at SIUE and two research intensive universities with strong BBR programs, Washington University in St. Louis and the SIU School of Medicine. The resulting research activity and collaboration will provide unique experiential learning opportunities for students and mentoring for graduate students and faculty, including those from URG. With SIUE's long history of service to the people of the region, many of whom live in the most economically depressed areas in the state, the project also has the potential to increase substantially the quality of life in the region."
"9451330","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are characterized by heightened fear reactivity to ambiguous threats. This over generalization of fear may arise from erroneous assessment of cue-associated contingency or failure to distinguish a safe environment from a previously experienced aversive one, which then results in inappropriate retrieval of aversive memories and activation of fear circuits. Since pattern separation in dentate gyrus (DG)-CA3 circuit is thought to minimize interference between similar inputs, it may serve as neural mechanism by which ambiguous threats are processed. The DG is host to ongoing neurogenesis throughout life in both rodents and humans and adult- born neurons have been implicated in pattern separation, suggesting a potential role for these cells in processing of ambiguous threats. However, the local circuit mechanisms and neural pathways by which adult- born neurons process ambiguous threats are poorly understood. Addressing this gap in our knowledge may generate fundamental insights into the neurobiology of fear generalization and fuel strategies to reengineer the DG-CA3 circuit to improve ambiguous threat processing. Here, we will use a multidisciplinary approach involving retro-and lenti-viral gene transduction, optogenetic based neural pathway manipulations, and behavioral analysis to interrogate the causal links between adult-born neuron dependent regulation of feed forward excitation-inhibition balance and DG-CA3 extrinsic circuitry with modulation of fear responses to ambiguous threats. In proof of concept studies, we propose to genetically reengineer excitation-inhibition balance in the DG-CA3 circuit to enhance processing of ambiguous threats and develop a hypothesis driven drug discovery approach to identify small molecule modulators of excitation-inhibition balance and consequently, fear generalization. Together, these studies will generate a scaffold for how adult-born dentate granule neurons dictate fear generalization and demonstrate how modulation of excitation-inhibition balance may be harnessed for treatment of fear generalization in anxiety disorders."
"9566020","High rates of contraceptive dissatisfaction, switching, and discontinuation in the US demand new approaches to contraceptive acceptability and promotion. Behavioral models of contraceptive use have failed to address sexuality, even though contraception is designed for sexual activity. By following new contraceptive users across 12 months, this study will 1) document sexual acceptability for a variety of contraceptive methods, 2) determine associations between sexual acceptability and continuation over time, and 3) set the stage for the creation of new, more valid sexuality measures to be used in future reproductive health research and interventions. The proposal catalyzes a patient-centered approach to contraception that has the potential to improve women's experiences with their methods. Research from this program could ultimately be used to help match women with the method(s) they will find the most sexually acceptable? methods they will like and use?thereby helping women fully realize the social, economic, and health benefits of contraception. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Many effective contraceptives are available today, but half of women discontinue use within a year due to dissatisfaction with available methods. Women have requested oral contraception to be used immediately in advance of infrequent intercourse. This proposed ?On Demand? Contraceptive Center is focused on the development of effective, safe, acceptable contraceptives for women which block ovulation to prevent pregnancy."

"9526807","Project Summary The candidate is a clinical psychologist and neuroscientist with a strong interest in the phenomenology, affective neurocircuitry, and effective treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is highly prevalent (7% in males, 12% in females), chronic and highly debilitating. One in every five veterans deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq have clinically significant PTSD symptoms. Empirically supported treatment (ESTs) for PTSD using trauma exposure have very large effect sizes in RCTs; however, recent work finds high rates of refusal and early drop-out among veterans (30-50%). We previously reported deficits in large scale distributed neural networks in PTSD, including increased connectivity between Default Mode Network (DMN) and Salience Network (SN), and we present pilot data that PTSD avoidant symptoms are linked to decreased DMN connectivity with Central Executive Network (CEN). We also reported a mindfulness-based intervention for PTSD decreased avoidance and increased connectivity between DMN and CEN. This K23 training program will allow the candidate to learn and apply the powerful whole-brain connectomic and dynamic connectivity methodologies needed to study the alterations in large scale distributed neural networks underlying PTSD and therapeutic mechanisms. Our hypotheses are H1: Decreased DMN-CEN and increased DMN-SN underlie emotional / behavioral avoidance associated with poor clinical acceptability and outcomes in PTSD patients, H2: Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) targets the same DMN-CEN connectivity linked with PTSD avoidance, and H3: MBCT-induced increased DMN-CEN connectivity mediates improvement in PTSD avoidance, emotional / behavioral avoidance, and improved outcomes. The aims are to: 1.) test if behavioral and emotional avoidance in PTSD are associated with decreased DMN-CEN connectivity, 2.) identify effects of MBCT on DMN-CEN using powerful connectomics analyses, and 3.) explore mediation relationships between DMN-CEN connectivity and behavioral and emotional engagement in subsequent therapy and clinical outcomes. fMRI with N=60 combat PTSD patients with rsFC using dynamic causal modeling, and contextual processing paradigms, will test association with avoidance symptoms and laboratory measures of emotional avoidance. An RCT (N=30 MBCT, N=30 control) with pre- post fMRI and group x time interaction analyses will identify effects of MBCT on connectivity among and between DMN, CEN, and SN. Mediation analyses will test neural targets and longitudinal measures of emotional engagement. This study will be the first targeting functional neural networks underlying avoidance behaviors in PTSD treatment, and may lead to additional strategies to help the ~50% PTSD patients who do not fully engage with existing ESTs, and elucidate neural mechanisms associated with a novel potential component of PTSD treatment (mindfulness training). It will also provide the candidate advanced training and pilot data for R-level funding to identify mechanisms of therapeutic change and novel treatments for PTSD."
"9496441","PROJECT SUMMARY V-ATPases are highly conserved proton pumps responsible for organelle acidification in all eukaryotic cells and for proton transport across plasma membranes in some settings. V-ATPase activity is associated with multiple disease states including osteoporosis, cancer, and neurodegeneration, making regulation of V-ATPase activity an attractive therapeutic target. However, the therapeutic promise of V-ATPase regulation has not been realized, in part because of the difficulty of targeting specific V-ATPase subpopulations. Reversible disassembly of the V1 and Vo sectors is a major mechanism of V-ATPase regulation. Disassembly inactivates the ATPase activity of V1 and closes the proton pore in Vo, effectively inhibiting ATP-driven proton transport, but is rapidly reversible in vivo. The molecular mechanisms governing this process are not well understood. The yeast RAVE (Regulator of the ATPase of Vacuoles and Endosomes) complex is required for efficient reassembly of V-ATPases. Rabconnectin complexes in higher eukaryotes are functional and structural homologues of yeast RAVE that are involved in assembly and activation of certain V-ATPase subpopulations. We propose to elucidate structural and mechanistic features of the yeast RAVE complex in order to better understand the mechanism of reversible disassembly and the involvement of RAVE/rabconnectins in V- ATPase regulation. Aim 1 builds on recent advances that allow purification of milligram quantities of yeast RAVE and RAVE-V1 complexes for the first time. We will address the molecular architecture of cytosolic RAVE and RAVE-V1 complexes through crosslinking-mass spectrometry, single particle cryo-EM, and structural analysis of core sub-complexes. These data will be integrated with preliminary data mapping regions of interaction within the RAVE complex and between RAVE and V1 subunits. Aim 2 focuses on the isoform specificity and glucose sensitivity of interactions between the RAVE complex and the Vo membrane domain. The yeast RAVE complex distinguishes between the two Vo a-subunit isoforms (Vph1 and Stv1) in yeast, and only V-ATPases containing the Vph1 isoform require RAVE for assembly and function. We will dissect how RAVE distinguishes Vph1 from Stv1, in order to better predict which mammalian V-ATPases might depend on rabconnectins for assembly. We will also use chemically induced heterodimerization to assess whether RAVE actively catalyzes V-ATPase reassembly or simply brings V1 and Vo subcomplexes into proximity in a glucose- dependent manner. Finally, we will test the mechanism through which glucose dictates the timing of V-ATPase reassembly and controls the RAVE-Vph1 interaction, and further dissect the kinetics and order of assembly events in vitro. Little is known about the structural underpinnings or mechanism of RAVE/rabconnectin- induced V-ATPase assembly. These experiments address these gaps and lay the groundwork for control of activity in defined V-ATPase subsets through manipulation of rabconnectin activity."

"9457174","Project Abstract: Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental principle of the nervous system and underlies many neurobiological processes including neurodevelopment, sensory processing, and memory storage. New gene transcription is required for long-lasting plasticity, and this requirement for transcription indicates that signals from stimulated synapses must reach the nucleus via synaptonuclear signaling. One such mechanism of synaptonuclear signaling that is essential for long-term plasticity is the physical translocation of signaling proteins from the synapse to the nucleus. While a few dozen proteins are known to undergo activity- dependent synapse-to-nucleus translocation, little work has been done to systematically identify the population of proteins that undergo this translocation. Moreover, little is known about the gene expression programs that these synaptonuclear signaling proteins initiate. This project aims to: 1) Characterize the gene regulatory role of an exemplar synaptonuclear signaling protein, CREB-Regulated Transcriptional Coactivator 1 (CRTC1); and 2) Systematically identify proteins that undergo synapse-to-nucleus translocation during plasticity. For the first aim, electrophysiology will be used to characterize late-phase long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in acute hippocampal slices from CRTC1 conditional knockout mice to study the function of CRTC1 in long-lasting plasticity. These studies will be complemented with RNA sequencing to determine the role of CRTC1 in the transcriptional programs that give rise to long-term plasticity. In the second aim, novel synaptonuclear signaling proteins will be identified using a biochemical screen. In brief, mass spectrometry will be used to identify synaptic proteins that are bound to the importin ?1 nuclear transport complex and are therefore likely to be cargo destined for nuclear import. Candidate proteins will be studied in the context of synaptic plasticity. Identifying novel proteins that translocate from synapse to nucleus will provide insight into the types of signals that translocate during plasticity, and the identity and function of these synaptonuclear signaling proteins will provide insights into the regulation of gene expression during plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is widely involved in neurological function and dysfunction, and therefore addressing these fundamental questions about synaptic plasticity will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders."
"9539405","Summary Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) imposes high mortality and long-term effects on patient quality-of- life. Circulatory shock secondary to sepsis is the leading cause of ARDS. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and protective ventilation strategies are the current standards of care; yet provide support only for innate mechanisms of healing. While these supportive therapies are helpful, they offer little improvement in overall mortality for severe ARDS. Currently, no methods exist for targeted treatment for the rapid rehabilitation of lungs affected by ARDS. To address this, our laboratory has designed a novel in vivo lung perfusion (IVLP) technique for the perfusion of lungs in vivo with Steen solution in a preclinical porcine model of ARDS, which allows for targeted lung rehabilitation. This technique involves cannulation of the pulmonary artery (inflow) and pulmonary veins (outflow) of the injured lung to enable closed-circuit perfusion and direct treatment. This technique combines the benefits of ECMO and ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP, used to assess marginal donor lungs for transplant) to provide a platform upon which injured lungs can be treated in vivo with targeted therapies in an isolated fashion without the potential risks of systemic treatment. Clinically, IVLP would be performed in a percutaneous fashion that could function as an adjuvant to ECMO therapy to shorten duration of support resulting in reduced morbidity and mortality. IVLP represents a novel method of therapy to reduce the severity of ARDS secondary to trauma or septic shock.  Our prior experience with both EVLP and ILVP strongly suggest that injured lungs can be successfully rehabilitated utilizing IVLP targeted therapy. This proposal will test the hypothesis that IVLP with Steen solution will rehabilitate lungs with LPS-induced ARDS in a preclinical porcine model with subsequent development of percutaneous techniques for this therapy. Specific Aim 1 will optimize the rehabilitative capacity of IVLP using a porcine model of LPS-induced lung injury. This will be accomplished through experiments that will optimize timing, confirm durability, and improve perfusion strategies. Specific Aim 2 will use in vitro models using pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells to define mechanisms for the protective effects of Steen solution on the alveolar-capillary barrier during IVLP. Specific Aim 3 will demonstrate the feasibility of percutaneous IVLP for the treatment of severe ARDS, which will be necessary for clinical translation. Our recent studies with IVLP demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of IVLP for the treatment of ARDS, representing a major paradigm shift in the management of ARDS. If successful, our proposed studies will define EVLP as a novel, viable platform for targeted therapy of ARDS and will lead a path for translation into human studies."
"9463791","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A competing renewal of R01 award MH074457 (currently in year 9) is requested. The R01 seeking renewal sustains the BrainMap Project (www.brainmap.org). The overall goal of the BrainMap Project is to provide the human brain mapping community with data sets, computational tools, and related resources that enable quantitative meta-analyses and co-activation mapping and functional decoding of neuroimaging data. The BrainMap Project manages two coordinate-based databases: 1) a functional activation repository of >11,000 published experiments (~45,000 subjects); and, 2) a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) repository of >2,700 published experiments (~63,000 subjects). The BrainMap Project provides a suite of tools (Sleuth, GingerALE, and Scribe) to access, curate, and analyze these datasets. To date, the tools and data have been used in >350 peer-reviewed meta-analytic publications, of which >170 were published by the community in the past two years (2012-2013). Four tool-development aims and four data sharing objectives are proposed.   Aim 1 proposes to improve anatomical specificity, null-distribution modeling, and normalization of contrast analyses computed using Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE).  Aim 2 proposes to develop tools for modeling large-scale co-activation patterns (i.e., across thousands of experiment) in the BrainMap database to extract & map functionally connected brain networks. Our tool development strategy adopts both bottom up (regional) and top down (global) approaches.  Aim 3 proposes to develop tools that utilize BrainMap's location-linked behavioral metadata for functional interpretation of brain regions and networks.  Aim 4 proposes to model neural networks affected by psychiatric and neurological disorders, both within and between disorders.  Sharing Objectives 1 & 2 provide user-oriented support for data entry and access for in-progress meta-  analyses as well as sharing of useful products of this projects and their publications.  Sharing Objectives 3 & 4 provide tools that facilitate the incorporation of Brain-Map derived tools and data into other image-analysis software environments."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed program, Empowering Nextgen Advanced Biomedical Leadership (ENABL), is a cohesive set of educational offerings and ancillary resources developed, overseen, and administered by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Meetings & Courses staff. The educational offerings are composed of in-residence short courses and workshops aimed at graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and independent investigators that are designed to develop skills in laboratory research, leadership/management, and scientific writing. Four of the courses currently exist and are held annually: three are two-week laboratory courses (Antibody Engineering & Phage Display, Single Cell Analysis, and Synthetic Biology) and one is a four-day workshop (Leadership in Bioscience). Two of the ENABL courses are new and proposed as part of this application: one is a new two-week laboratory course in Metabolomics and the other is a new four-day Scientific Writing Retreat. Historically, CSHL courses have proven to be natural environments for career discussions and mentorship. Indeed, past participants describe the courses as unparalleled professional networking experiences. We therefore expect strong mentoring relationships to likewise develop in the courses and workshops that are part of ENABL. The program will also have significant components in the areas of dissemination and outreach. In particular, we propose to develop freely available video archives of formal lectures, invited talks, and tutorials for the four laboratory courses (Antibody Engineering & Phage Display, Single Cell Analysis, Synthetic Biology, and Metabolomics). In total, ENABL will directly affect approximately 110 trainees each year, plus countless more who will benefit from the publicly available video archives developed as part of the program."
"9460981","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteostasis is an integral component of healthy aging. In most metazoans, protein quality declines during aging, resulting in accrual of damaged or self-aggregating cytotoxic proteins, linked to several age-associated diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease) and pathology (e.g., sarcopenia, cataracts). The mouse-sized naked mole-rat [NMRs] lives ~5 times longer than expected based on body size, and despite detected high levels of oxidative damage even at a young age, maintain good health for most of their long lives. Like other long-lived animal models, both in vivo and in vitro studies reveal that NMRs are resistant to a broad spectrum of environmental stressors. Collectively these findings suggest that NMRs possess efficient mechanisms to maintain protein quality. Our research has previously shown that this is attributed in part to altered proteasome forms and subcellular location. However, changes in proteasome-related molecular chaperone activity that assists in the transport of damaged proteins into the proteasome may also play a role in this decline. Here we examine key proteasome-related molecular chaperones [HSPs] and the heat-shock factor 1 [HSF1] transcription factor in the brain, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, testes, and quadriceps leg muscle in mice and NMRs. HSP25 both showed higher levels of protein in NMRs compared to mice in all the tissues examined. Hence we measured HSP25 protein content in seven rodents with ages ranging from four to 32 years in both liver and muscle. This comparison resulted in a significant correlation with longevity suggesting that HSP25 may play a key role in age-related maintenance of protein homeostasis in long-lived animals. A review of the literature suggested that HSP25 was involved in a number of cellular systems or responses including heat stress, proteasome activity, autophagy, inflammatory response, and cell structure stabilization all to prevent apoptosis in the cell. Thus, we test the overall hypothesis that HSP25 mediates the trafficking of proteins to different protein degradative pathways based upon the stress-state of the cell to maintain homeostasis, and this action is an integral component responsible for increasing longevity and healthspan in long-lived species."
"9493618","Background. Metastasis to vital organs is the cause of death in a large majority of cancer patients. Although it is of eminent clinical importance to understand how systemic disease evolves, metastasis remains one of the least understood aspects of cancer progression. We still do not have the answers to many fundamental questions: Are metastasis founders a random selection of cells from primary tumors in which all cells have essentially equal metastatic ability? Or do specialized metastatic clones evolve, perhaps in intermediate sanctuary spaces like regional lymph nodes, and then proceed to colonize distant body parts? Are metastases formed late in tumor progression, by highly evolved and aggressive clones that are the winners of many years of selection within the primary tumor? Or can metastases already be formed early in tumor development, by less evolved tumor cells? If both scenarios exist, would such ?early? metastases behave differently from ?late? disseminating tumor cells? Method. We have developed a methodology to reconstruct a cancer's evolutionary history with great accuracy. Our method relies on the analysis of insertion/deletion mutations in hypermutable, non-coding polyguanine repeats. The lineage information encoded in these sequences is unusually rich: genotyping of only a few dozen repeats can outperform exome sequencing for phylogenetic reconstruction. Using polyguanine fingerprinting, we have recently shown that regional lymph node metastases are not the source of liver metastases in most colorectal cancers, in contrast to a widely held paradigm. Aims and Impact. Here, we propose to build upon these results and further elucidate critical events in the evolution of metastatic colorectal cancer. We will determine if lethal distant metastases in the lungs evolve from specialized metastatic clones that reside in the colonic lymph nodes. We have previously established that 65% of liver metastases are seeded directly from the primary tumor, but the anatomy of the gastrointestinal vasculature suggests that this percentage could be significantly lower for other distant metastases. If this hypothesis were confirmed, our understanding of the role of the lymphatics in colorectal cancer would be fundamentally altered. Second, we present preliminary data indicating that distant metastases whose evolutionary trajectory diverged from the primary tumor in early progression stages are considerably less aggressive than metastases that emerge in later stages. We propose to study and confirm this phenomenon in a large patient cohort. The successful outcome will be a simple, cost-effective test to predict long-term survival in a subset of patients with metastatic cancer. Since some patients can survive for years or even decades in spite of metastatic disease, while others die within weeks of diagnosis, such risk stratification would be of substantial benefit to both patients and their care providers."
"9548010","Currently, preclinical TBI research and testing of experimental therapeutic in animal models of TBI  models, the most commonly used outcome endpoints are lesion volume/size, neuronal cell preservation  and behavioral functional outcome measures (such as Morris water maze, rotarod). While these  measures are clearly useful ? they lack the ability to inform on the underlying distinct  pathophysiological mechanisms relevant in human TBI. These factors might have contributed to the  lack of translational success for new TBI therapeutics from animal models efficacy to clinical  trial efficacy. Consistent with the vision of the Translational Outcomes Project in Neurotrauma  (TOP- NT) (UG3/UH3) RFA, here we carefully assembled a multidisciplinary team and proposed to  evaluate two complementary pathological mechanism-based TBI outcome measures ? (i) biofluid  biomarker assessment, and (ii) MRI-neuroimaging biomarker assessment. These assessments are chosen  because they are both highly quantitative and can readily transition into clinical TBI studies and  future therapeutic trials. Our central hypothesis is as follows: In preclinical multi-site  multi-TBI animal model setting, biofluid-based biomarker and quantitative MRI-based neuroimaging  biomarker assessment can be developed into useful translational outcome measures that can help  address a range of clinical TBI pathological mechanistic subphenotypes including axonal injury,  contusion/tissue necrosis, loss of synaptic continuity, white matter injury, microvascular  injury/brain hemorrhage and neuroinflammation. We have also put together a ?Clinical TBI  Translational Advisory? panel to assist us with translating our findings into clinical studies."
"9568710","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) exposure is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among children; it is related to multiple diseases and increases the risk of hospitalization. Effective interventions exist for smoking cessation. In addition to the need for effective cessation interventions, there is an important role for counseling on exposure reduction, especially as evidence suggests that families with home smoking bans are more likely to quit smoking over time. Several studies have studied effective ways to provide cessation and exposure reduction counseling to parents of children in the outpatient setting and for adult inpatient smokers, including the Clinical Effort Against Secondhand Smoke (CEASE) project. The inpatient stay presents different challenges and opportunities from outpatient practice in the treatment of children's smoke exposure. The hospitalization of a child may present a teachable moment for parents who smoke. Several small studies of parents of hospitalized children have found modest success with inpatient interventions involving counseling, and QuitLine referral or nicotine replacement therapy. Our intervention uses the evidence-based US Public Health Service Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence guidelines coupled with the best evidence specific to using the child's inpatient stay to help parents quit smoking and reduce their children's exposure. We will use the RE-AIM framework to evaluate and maximize our institution's readiness to change, as well as intervention implementation and maintenance. We are proposing a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of our intervention bundle. The specific aims of the study are: Aim 1) To assess the efficacy of the intervention in increasing parent report of having smoke-free homes and cars 6 months after hospitalization; Aim 2) To demonstrate whether children whose parents receive the intervention bundle have greater decreases in cotinine levels 6 months post-hospitalization; Aim 3) To assess the efficacy of the intervention in increasing parent quit rates  months after hospitalization; Aim 4) To use implementation process measures from the RE-AIM framework to assess the extent that our intervention results in hospital-wide systems change, including automatic screening for tobacco smoke exposure and delivery of tobacco control services. To achieve these aims, we are proposing a randomized controlled trial of our intervention bundle, which is evidence-based, effective in outpatient settings, and pilot-tested within our institution. We will follow both the control and intervention groups for 6 months, and use biological markers of exposure to assess exposure reduction and parent cessation. Understanding whether traditional smoking cessation interventions can help parents of hospitalized children will give inpatient providers an effective toolkit for providing a comprehensive intervention for tobacco cessation and exposure reduction."
"9458227","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the continuing rise of the U.S. Hispanic population, reversing the Hispanic childhood obesity epidemic is critical to the nation's future health. Mexican American children and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged families often are far more overweight and obese than their peers, heightening their risk for obesity-related health complications. Our proposed randomized controlled trial, the Pediatric Obesity Management Trial (POM) for Hispanic Families, aims to improve Hispanic children's body composition by testing a comprehensive, culturally and linguistically relevant, family-oriented intervention for overweight and obese (e 85th percentile of body mass index [BMI]) Hispanic children ages 6-11 in pediatric clinics in San Antonio, Texas, a largely Hispanic city. Our team, formed during our pilot research funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (1H0CMS030457), unites academic investigators and community partners with experience working together to conduct behavioral and clinical interventions and outreach with Hispanics. The POM trial will test the efficacy of a 6-month pediatric obesity management intervention (physician counseling plus telephone counseling, newsletters and text messages) compared to standard care (physician counseling only) on three outcomes: 1) body composition (i.e., waist circumference, weight and z-BMI); 2) insulin, glucose and cholesterol levels; and 3) behavior change in physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior and consumption of sugary beverages and fruits and vegetables. We will recruit 230 overweight and obese children-and a parent or guardian for each-and randomize them to the POM intervention (n = 115 child/parent dyads) or standard care (n = 115 child/parent dyads). From a baseline, we will measure the impact of the trial on the primary outcome (body composition) and secondary outcomes (insulin, glucose and cholesterol levels and several specific health behavior changes) at 1 month, 6 and 12 months post-randomization. We also will evaluate the critical role of parenting strategies and changes in the home environment as mediators of intervention effects. We hypothesize that intervention children will significantly improve their body composition, increased their PA levels and diet quality (more fruits and vegetables and less sugary beverages), and decrease their sedentary activity, compared to children in standard care. If successful, this study will generate new scientific knowledge about effective Hispanic family-based approaches for obesity prevention with high potential for replication in underserved areas across the nation."
"9522461","Solid tumors are characterized by an abundant, tumor-promoting inflammatory infiltrate that is comprised largely of immune suppressive macrophages, monocytes and granulocytes. These immune suppressive cells prevent T cell recruitment and/or activation in the tumor microenvironment and stimulate tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. As approximately 1,700,000 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2016, and 600,000 patients will die from cancer in 2016 alone, there is a pressing need to advance research into the mechanisms by which immune suppressive myeloid cells promote tumor progression to enable the development of novel therapeutics that can target these immune suppressive cells. We recently found that PI(3)Kinase ? controls a critical switch between immune stimulation and immune suppression during inflammation and cancer. We found that PI3K? promotes both myeloid cell recruitment and immune suppressive polarization in tumors. PI3K? signals through mTor and Akt to induce an immune suppressive transcriptional program that inhibits T cell activation. In contrast, selective inactivation of macrophage PI3K? stimulates NF?B and TBK1, thus promoting an immunostimulatory transcriptional program that stimulates CD8+ T cell activation and anti-tumor cytotoxicity. Inhibition of PI3K? re-polarized tumor associated macrophages and synergized with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy to promote tumor clearance as well as lasting immunological anti-tumor memory in mouse models of cancer. In addition, we found that a PI3K?-directed, anti-inflammatory gene expression signature predicted poor survival in lung, breast, gastric and head and neck cancer patients. As a result of our findings, PI3K? inhibitors have entered solid tumor clinical trials at UCSD and elsewhere. In these proposed studies, we will evaluate the premise that PI3K? plays an essential role in tumor progression by regulating key signal transduction and transcription pathways that control myeloid cell trafficking and polarization. We will characterize the detailed molecular mechanisms by which myeloid cell PI3K? regulates tumor progression. We hypothesize that a precise understanding of the molecular events by which PI3K? regulates tumor progression will enable us to develop novel therapies for the treatment of these diseases. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To identify the molecular mechanisms by which PI3K? regulates macrophage/myeloid cell polarity and immune responses in vitro and in vivo; 2) To determine how PI3K?!regulates immune suppressive myeloid cell accumulation in tumors and develop strategies to inhibit their accumulation; and 3) To identify mechanisms by which PI3K? inhibition synergizes with cancer therapeutics to suppress tumor progression. !"
"9460565","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among the major mental illnesses of early adulthood, people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) (i.e., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder) exhibit a continuum of impairment in social functioning. Treatment is minimally effective, and impairments tend to persist. Knowledge on the neurobiology of social cognitive (SCog) process impairment will foster therapeutic discovery. At each of our sites, pilot data show that people with SSDs who are among the most socially impaired have a low likelihood of functional recovery and manifest impairment in discrete brain circuits that are known to be involved in the neurobiology of SCog processes in healthy individuals. Leveraging our pilot data, which is consistent across three sites, and the expertise of our group in SSD research related to phenomenology, outcomes, multi-site neuroimaging, and treatment innovation, we propose to use the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) investigational framework in people with SSDs to comprehensively and definitively delineate the neurobiology of SCog process impairment. Our approach will employ advanced structural and functional neuroimaging approaches to identify the neural circuitry (along a continuum from healthy controls to people with SSDs) that predict impairments in SCog processes and concomitant social function. We plan to use advanced neuroimaging and network analysis approaches including: 1) gray matter morphology approaches to map the thickness of the cortex and examine cortical thickness network topology, 2) DTI acquisition and analytic approaches to map white matter circuits in the brain; and 3) fMRI-based approaches to engage these same circuits, including functional connectivity measures to obtain detailed measures of circuit function. We will then use our group's expertise in sophisticated multivariate neuroimaging statistics (partial least squares), to extract dimensional features relating brain structure ->brai function -> behavior and provide a comprehensive understanding of the neurobiology of social processes from circuit to behavior across normal and abnormal (SSDs) domains. Our proposal is modeled directly within the RDoC framework; specifically, we are using a Matrix of Analysis as our guiding structure to identify the neurobiology of SCog process constructs from normal controls across the entire schizophrenia spectrum. We anticipate identifying substantially abnormal brain-behavior relationships starting from the level of circuit characterization. The ultimate goal of our collaborative team is to identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of social impairments by identifying the underlying neural circuitry and pathophysiology of impaired social function."
"9462691","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the only leading cause of death with no effective means of slowing its progression. Varying models predict the involvement of diverse neurodegenerative stresses, including amyloid beta (Aß) peptides, proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and energetic stress in mediating the pathogenesis of both familial (FAD) and sporadic (SAD) forms of the disease. In spite of decades of active research and a deep molecular understanding of many of the major molecular players in the progression of dementia, there are many areas of confusion. For example, there is good agreement on the fact that excess production of amyloid-ß is a causative or major contributing factor to the initiation of dementia and most mouse models to study AD utilize the expression of human amyloid precursor protein (APP) with early onset AD mutations (usually along with other mutant human proteins) to generate mice that develop cognitive deficits and at least some aspects of human AD pathology. However, there is still much debate over the actual form of the Aß that induces the synaptic deficits. In addition, a plethora of neuronal proteins with totally unrelated functions that interact with human Aß have been identified and elimination of any one of these binding partners alone was sufficient to reduce or eliminate the cognitive deficits when these mice were crossed with an AD mouse model over producing Aß. No current model can explain how single elimination of the different Aß binding partners protects against development of Aß-induced cognitive deficits. We recently showed that very active forms of soluble Aß consisting of dimers and trimers (Aßd/t), as well as proinflammatory cytokines (TNFa, IL-1ß, IL-6) stimulate NADPH oxidase (NOX) and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neurons through a cellular prion protein (PrPC)-dependent pathway. This pathway stimulated the formation of rod-shaped bundles of 1:1 cofilin:actin (rods), which cause synaptic dysfunction. Formation of rods requires activation (dephosphorylation) of the actin binding protein cofilin as well as its oxidation to form intermolecular disulfide bonds. Rods do not form i response to Aß or proinflammatory cytokines in PrPC-null neurons, but surprisingly, over expression of PrPC alone is sufficient to induce rods at much higher levels than are induced by Aß of proinflammatory cytokine treatment. Thus, we have proposed a new model in which multiple receptors can contribute to NOX activation and ROS production through PrPC-interactions in enlarged membrane domains. The triggering of cofilin oxidation to form rods is dependent on achieving a threshold level of ROS and this is why coalescence of many different receptors into signaling complexes contributes to achieving this ROS level. Rods sequester cofilin and can occlude neurites, blocking transport, either of which inhibit normal synaptic function. Using cultured primary neurons and several knock-out or transgenic mouse lines, we propose to determine (1) if the relative rod-inducing activities of different forms of Aß relate t their direct affinity for PrPC, (2) if specific proinflammatory cytokine receptors are required for their rod induction through the PrPC- dependent pathway, (3) if the PrPC-pathway functions in both axons and dendrites and if mislocalization of rod signaling components occurs between compartments, and (4) the role in cofilin activation played by three likely components of the cytoplasmic domain of PrPC-signaling complexes."
"9414640","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     The goals of this project are to apply genetic approaches to resolve the biology of kidney malformations. Kidney and urinary tract malformations account for up to 50% of pediatric end-stage kidney failure worldwide. They are highly heterogeneous in manifestation and outcome, and the biological basis of these disorders is poorly understood, limiting the development of optimal diagnostic and prognostic tools to improve clinical management. During the last funding cycle, we achieved considerable progress in resolving the genetic architecture and biology of kidney malformations. We found that pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) are a common (10.5% of the cohort) and overlooked cause of kidney malformations. Applying exome sequencing, we defined a new syndrome caused by mutations in Dual Serine-threonine and Tyrosine Kinase (DSTYK) in 2.3% of children with urinary tract malformations. Altogether, our studies suggest that point mutations or CNV disorders can explain 25-30% of congenital kidney defects and provide many novel opportunities for clinical and basic investigations.  Here, we now propose to extend these studies in a large cohort of patients with kidney malformations. In aim 1, we will develop a comprehensive map of genomic structural variants contributing to kidney malformations and define candidate genes. In aim 2, we will define additional candidate genes for kidney malformations via analysis of exome data from 100 index cases from multiplex families and 50 trios derived from sporadic cases. In aim, we will comprehensively model variants in zebrafish and confirm novel genes for kidney malformation by screening for independent mutations in the full cohort using Molecular Inversion Probe resequencing. Finally we will perform genotype/phenotype correlations to aid in the characterization and workup for patients with kidney malformations."
"9460301","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite current standard of care, a diagnosis of heart failure (HF) is associated with poor quality-of-life and a 5-year mortality approaching 50%. In light of this urgent unmet need, the elucidation of novel mechanisms involved in HF pathogenesis holds promise for identifying new therapies for this prevalent and deadly disease. The PIs of this application were the first to illustrate a crucial role for a conserved family of acetyl-lysine reader proteins (BET bromodomains) in the transcriptional control of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and HF. Importantly, these studies leveraged the use of JQ1, a first-in-class, specific small molecule inhibitor of BET bromodomains. This multi-PI application seeks to vertically advance our understanding of how aberrant chromatin dependent signal transduction (via the BET family member BRD4) drives pathologic cardiac remodeling. Our long-term objective is to develop BET bromodomain inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy in HF. Exciting preliminary studies demonstrate that BRD4 mediates cardiomyocyte (CM) hypertrophy in vitro and that BET inhibition with JQ1 potently suppresses the development of pressure-overload mediated cardiac hypertrophy in mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that BRD4 occupies active enhancers in the adult mouse heart, recruits PTEF-b activity to transcriptional start sites, and triggers pause-release of RNA Polymerase II to activate genes critical for HF pathogenesis. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that pathologic stress leads to specific accumulation of BRD4 protein in CMs without any increase in Brd4 mRNA. Finally, we demonstrate that class I HDACs, which are generally pro-hypertrophic, are specifically required for BRD4 protein accumulation. Based on this rationale, this proposal will test the central hypothesis that BRD4 functions as a nodal transcriptional regulator of pathological cardiac remodeling that can be pharmacologically targeted in vivo. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three robust specific aims: (1) Elucidate the effects of BET inhibition in clinically relevant models of HF and during physiological cardiac plasticity; (2) Dissect the transcriptional mechanisms by which BRD4 drives dynamic enhancer remodeling, chromatin-dependent signal transduction, and selective gene control during cardiac stress; (3) Define the mechanisms by which HDACs crosstalk with BET proteins to integrate upstream signals with pro-hypertrophic gene expression in the heart. The proposed research is significant because it seeks to develop pharmacologic BET bromodomain inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy in HF, and therefore addresses an enormous unmet clinical need. Our proposal is highly innovative because we successfully drug pathologic myocardial transcription and remodeling via an unprecedented approach. Given the synergistic expertise of our consortium, we envision that sustained contributions from our highly-collaborative group will pave the way for the development of novel epigenetic therapies for cardiovascular disease."
"9456577","Postnatal bone formation relies on skeletal progenitor/stem cells (SSCs). Recent in vivo lineage-tracing studies indicate that SSC populations are temporally and spatially- regulated with distinct SSC populations functioning during bone growth and maintenance. In addition, it has been suggested that growth-associated SSCs are the predecessors to adult SSCs implying that a hierarchy may exist among the various progenitor/stem cell populations demonstrating a high degree of complexity within this system. Given this, it is likely that disruption in growth-associated SSC number, function or timing will translate into altered bone mass in adulthood. Telomerase (Tert) activity prevents cellular senescence and is required for maintenance of stem cells in regenerative tissues. Prior studies have shown that telomerase is necessary for SSC self-renewal and differentiation. In addition, decline of telomerase activity in humans correlates with a decrease in bone homeostasis leading to osteoporosis. Utilizing mTert-GFP and mTert-rtTA transgenic reporter mouse lines we investigated the role of mTert-expressing cells in postnatal mouse bone development. Quantitative RNA and histological analyses of long bones revealed that mTert is expressed predominantly at the time of weaning, suggesting these cells are temporally regulated and mark a discrete developmental time point between rapid bone growth and bone maintenance, which we have termed ?transitional growth.? Further analysis using in vivo lineage-tracing showed that mTert+ cells function as osteochondral progenitor cells. What physiological factors regulate the temporal pattern of mTert+ SSCs and whether their presence during this specific postnatal developmental stage is crucial for proper adult bone maintenance remains to be determined. Therefore, this proposal will 1) investigate the effect of two well-known physiological growth-regulating factors, estrogen and parathyroid hormone, on mTert+ SSCs and 2) investigate whether altering the temporal pattern, number or function of these cells translates into changes in adult bone."
"9461536","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Studies of Comparative Treatments for REtinal Vein Occlusion 2 (SCORE2) is a phase III trial to study patients with central retinal vein occlusion. This comparative effectiveness research proposal aims to support a multicenter, prospective, randomized, phase III clinical trial to compare treatment protocols for decreased vision due to macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Currently, two anti-vascular endothelial grown factor (VEGF) compounds, bevacizumab and ranibizumab, have become first-line therapy in CRVO eyes that have vision loss due to macular edema. The newest anti-VEGF molecule, aflibercept, was recently shown to be effective in patients with macular edema due to CRVO in the COPERNICUS Study sponsored by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (Tarrytown, NY). The SCORE2 trial is a noninferiority trial between a first generation anti-VEGF treatment, bevacizumab, and a second generation anti-VEGF treatment, aflibercept. The noninferiority margin will be set at an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity letter score of 5. In SCORE2, patients will be assigned randomly to 1) intravitreal aflibercept every 4 weeks or 2) intravitreal bevacizumab every 4 weeks. The primary noninferiority comparison between the 2 groups will be performed at 6 months. At 6 months, participants assigned to aflibercept injection at baseline that meet the criteria for a good response will be randomized to either continuing aflibercept every 4 weeks vs. changing to a fixed regimen of every 8 weeks. This will allow for an assessment of whether a fixed regimen of every 8 week injections can produce visual results similar to continued treatment Q4 weeks. At 6 months, participants assigned to bevacizumab at baseline that meet the criteria for a good response will be randomized to either continuing bevacizumab injection every 4 weeks vs. changing to a pro re nata (PRN) regimen with monthly assessement. This will allow for an assessment of whether a PRN regimen can produce visual results similar to continued treatment every 4 weeks. All participants will be followed for 13 months."
"9543697","The long-term goal of this project is to understand how intramembrane metalloproteases (IMMPs) function in bacteria. IMMPs are broadly conserved membrane-embedded enzymes that cleave their substrates within a membrane or near the membrane surface. Bacterial IMMPs play important roles during infections, stress responses, cell division, sporulation, mating, and polar morphogenesis. Understanding how IMMPs function in bacteria could lead to the development of new antibiotics. In eukaryotes, IMMPs cleave transcription factors that regulate lipid metabolism, responses to endoplasmic reticulum stress, and skin and neurological development. These pathways are critical for human health. Knowledge about bacterial IMMPs will facilitate studies of eukaryotic IMMPs, which could lead to the development of novel therapeutics.  Little is known about how IMMPs select their substrates or how IMMP activity can be regulated. To fill this knowledge gap, the project focuses on two IMMPs of Bacillus subtilis that represent two large subfamilies of IMMPs. SpoIVFB represents the CBS domain subfamily. CBS domains sense cellular energy levels and regulate the activity of a variety of proteins. SpoIVFB cleaves Pro-?K during B. subtilis sporulation when cells have been starving for hours. The cleavage reaction requires ATP, which binds to the CBS domain of SpoIVFB. We hypothesize that the ATP level rises in the mother cell compartment after the completion of forespore engulfment and the destruction of channels through which the mother cell feeds the forespore. ATP binding to the CBS domain is proposed to induce a conformational change in SpoIVFB that positions Pro-?K for cleavage. To test this model, a combination of genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches is proposed. Likewise, a combination of approaches is proposed to achieve a molecular understanding of the mechanism of SpoIVFB inhibition by its natural inhibitors, the proteins BofA and SpoIVFA. Knowledge from studies of SpoIVFB inhibition by BofA and SpoIVFA, and activation by ATP, could guide efforts to develop IMMP regulators that benefit human health.  The second B. subtilis IMMP is RasP and it represents the PDZ domain subfamily. RasP functions in stress responses and cell division. In stress responses, RasP cleaves an anti-? transmembrane segment after initial cleavage of the anti-? extracytoplasmic domain. However, our genetic evidence suggests that RasP cleaves a cell division protein without a prior cleavage. Biochemical experiments are proposed to test this potential new paradigm. The known substrates of RasP do not account for certain defects of a rasP mutant or for the effects of RasP depletion. Innovative approaches are proposed to identify the unknown substrate(s) of RasP. Knowledge from studies of RasP is expected to advance understanding of substrate selectivity by PDZ domain-containing IMMPs and facilitate studies of related eukaryotic IMMPs that function in pathways critical for human health."
"9538942","PROJECT ABSTRACT  More than 180 susceptibility loci for breast cancer have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), mainly in Caucasian populations. However, many of these risk variants cannot be directly replicated in women of African ancestry, suggesting that causal variants are yet to be identified. Polygenic risk scores (PRS), which aggregate common genetic variants identified by GWAS, have been developed to predict genetic risk of breast cancer for Caucasian women, but there is no validated PRS for African American women. The linkage equilibrium in African ancestry populations is much less extensive than in Caucasian and Asian populations, which makes African ancestry population the ideal population to find causative variants after localizing a breast cancer susceptibility locus. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive analytical study that leverages several types of existing genetic datasets for breast cancer available to us and in public domains to address three specific aims. First, we aim to conduct cross-ethnic fine-mapping analysis for narrowing down casual variant candidate lists in 180+ loci of breast cancer. We will compile and harmonize genetic data from studies of breast cancer in women of African ancestry, including 7,525 cases and 6,207 controls, and leverage the association results from Caucasians (>122,000 cases and >105,000 controls), East Asians (>14,000 cases and >13,000 controls), and Latinos (4,400 cases and 7,500 controls). We will use a Bayesian statistical method to directly incorporate multiple functional annotations for the top variants in each locus. Second, we aim to develop breast cancer polygenic risk score models in African Americans by leveraging functional annotations, linkage disequilibrium, and gene expression data. Several PRSs will be developed for overall breast cancer risk and by estrogen receptor, cross-validated internally, and validated with external studies. Third, we aim to develop breast cancer risk prediction model by combining both genetic and non-genetic factors. The proposed study will efficiently utilize several types of existing data using innovative integrative approaches and has the potential to advance the field by narrowing down the genetic regions containing causal variants. More importantly, the risk prediction model has a good potential to translate knowledge from GWAS to the practice of breast cancer screening."
"9453693","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Male fertility requires continual spermatogenesis which relies on the actions of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). The SSC pool serves as a reservoir from which progenitor spermatogonia arise that transiently amplify in number before committing to differentiation in response to retinoic acid (RA). Maintenance of the germline requires that the SSC pool itself must be resistant to RA stimulation. The molecular signals that control SSC actions remain poorly understood. However, during the current project period we discovered that several molecules including multiple members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factor family influence activities of SSCs and progenitor spermatogonia. In particular, we found that: 1) the HLH factor ID4 is expressed by SSCs specifically and promotes self-renewal; 2) the cell cycle regulator RB is required for maintenance of the SSC pool and physically interacts with ID4; 3) expression of the key stem cell transcription factor SOX2 is linked with the ID4+/SSC population; and 4) the class II HLH factors NEUROG3 and SOHLH1 are expressed by both SSC and progenitor spermatogonia but, in contrast to ID4, these molecules influence differentiation capacity of progenitors rather than self-renewal of SSCs. To facilitate our studies, we generated a novel mouse line in which ID4+ spermatogonia are marked by expression of GFP, and utilized this model to define features of the transcriptome that distinguish SSC and progenitor subtypes. The studies described in this renewal proposal are designed to extend these findings for advancing the understanding of mechanisms controlling maintenance of the SSC pool. Our aims are to: 1) define the mechanism regulating SSC proliferation by critically examining the importance of an ID4-RB interaction, 2) define the mechanism inducing an SSC-specific transcriptome by determining the importance of a link between ID4 and SOX2, and 3) determine the mechanism conferring resistance to RA signaling in SSCs by investigating whether ID4 antagonizes the ability of NEUROG3 and SOHLH1 to relay the RA response. The combined results from these studies will enhance our understanding of the biology of SSCs, and this knowledge will be useful in determining causes of male infertility and in the generation of new diagnostic and treatment tools. The knowledge gained may also aid in devising strategies to protect the SSC pool from detrimental effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy that often eliminate the germline of male cancer patients, resulting in infertility. Moreover, spermatogenesis is a classic model of stem cell dependent lineages, thus knowledge gained about the biology of SSCs may be applicable to stem cells in other tissues."
"9462004","Project Summary/Abstract  There is an urgent need to find effective preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments as quickly as possible. We established the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative (API) to help launch a new era in AD prevention research, evaluating promising investigational preclinical AD treatments in people who, based on their genetic background and age, are at extremely high risk of progression to the clinical stages of AD, and helping to establish the biomarker and cognitive endpoints and accelerated regulatory approval pathway needed to rapidly evaluate new treatments. Our original API autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) grant proposed to prepare for and conduct the first stage of a 5-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of an anti-amyloid agent in 200 cognitively unimpaired Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation carriers and placebo treated in 100 non- carriers (NC) from the world's largest ADAD kindred in Colombia. Outcomes include a sensitive composite cognitive endpoint and the best established brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD. Other goals are to clarify whether the treatment's biomarker effects are reasonably likely to predict later clinical benefit and help qualify them as surrogate endpoints under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway and provide a better test of the amyloid hypothesis. The grant received an outstanding priority score in 2012, permitted us to select our industry partner, Genentech, and its promising anti-amyloid antibody, crenezumab, garner $15M from philanthropy and the majority of funding from Genentech, and establish a novel agreement to share data and biological samples after the trial. Our subsequent proposal for another preclinical trial of both an active immunotherapy against amyloid and a medication to reduce its production (a BACE inhibitor) in cognitively unimpaired APOE4 homozygotes also received an outstanding priority score and secured NIH, Novartis/Amgen, and philanthropic support. API has created exceptionally large registries along the way to support enrollment in these and other trials. Our API ADAD trial was launched in 2013 and is going well; enrollment is expected to end in late 2016 and the trial will end in 2021. Our original aims were to prepare for and launch the first stage of this preclinical ADAD/biomarker development trial; clarify whether crenezumab's biomarker effects are related to a subsequent clinical benefit, explore the extent to which baseline biomarkers are associated with a differential response to treatment or subsequent cognitive decline in the absence of treatment; and eventually create a user- friendly public resource of preclinical AD trial data and biological samples after the trial is over. Our Current API ADAD Grant Aims are to 1) address the original aims, 2) Extend blinded treatment for those enrolled earliest in the to increase power to detect cognitive benefit, complete the trial, and address the original aims in a manner that provides the greatest benefit to the field; 3) Acquire tau PET images at the participants' 30 and 60 month visits and clarify their ability to predict clinical benefit and course; 4) Provide a secure and robust data repository along with the data search and visualization tools to support the most productive, prevalent, and appropriate use of data after the trial is over; and 5) Establish the infrastructure needed to share biological samples in the most productive and appropriate way. The proposed grant will help API investigators oversee the trial until its completion, analyze and report the data, incorporate and clarify the theragnostic value of tau PET images, and develop the infrastructure to share data and biological samples, aims that will not be funded by Genentech (nor our new APAI ADAD partner, Roche). This is an extremely inclusive project, having been vetted by leading academic and community stakeholder advisors, and representatives from the NIA, FDA, European Medicines Agency, and pharmaceutical research companies.    "
"9458113","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long term goals of this project are to determine the functional roles of small, non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating cartilage development and homeostasis. Acquiring such new knowledge will be critical for the generation of alternative microRNA-based strategies to treat trauma-induced cartilage defects and prevent progression toward osteoarthritis, the most common degenerative disease in humans.  To elucidate which miRNAs to study further, we carried out TaqMan(R)-based microarrays on RNA extracted from human embryonic cartilage tissue to identify highly-expressed miRNAs as well as differentially- expressed miRNAs between precursor, differentiated and hypertrophic chondrocytes in vivo. From these studies, we have generated an exciting candidate list of miRNAs to pursue that has not yet been studied within the context of cartilage biology. We hypothesize that these miRNAs are functional in regulating specific phases of chondrocyte differentiation and/or are involved in modulating homeostasis of mature cartilage tissue under pathophysiological conditions. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the function of miRNAs in regulating phases of chondrocyte differentiation by utilizing a human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) assay system in vitro and murine embryonic metatarsal bone explants ex vivo. A state-of-the-art approach to immunoprecipitate RNA- induced silencing complexes (RISCs) followed by RNA sequencing will be applied to identify miRNA target genes and the cellular pathways affected. In Specific Aim 2, a well-controlled, non-invasive murine joint loading model will be used to determine how expression levels of specific miRNAs in chondrocytes are altered in response to pathophysiological conditions. The function of these miRNAs in regulating catabolic or anabolic pathways in chondrocytes will also be elucidated.  Clinically, the research proposed in this application is important given that there is an unmet need for: 1) effective strategies to repair or regenerate articular cartilage using stem cells and 2) therapeutic interventions to treat injured articular cartilage, control homeostasis and prevent development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Since miRNAs can fine-tune the expression of multiple genes, they may be more useful tools than siRNA in complex diseases such as osteoarthritis that involve interactomes of molecular players. Notably, the studies proposed in this application are timely given the emergence of miRNAs as potential therapeutic targets in other disease scenarios in addition to current advances being made to deliver small molecules to mimic or inhibit miRNA function in vivo."

This project will be the first to use peer narratives to increase teenage contraceptive use, which is highly dependent on peer influences.1-10  Dr. Patel is a board-certified obstetrician gynecologist who has published 9 articles on contraceptive research11-19 and independently secured funding for one of her projects through the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists.15 Dr. Patel proposes to use a detailed career development plan involving obtaining an MPH, attending local and national seminars and conferences, obtaining one-on-one mentoring, writing manuscripts, and participating in hands-on research activities. These activities will allow her to establish a deeper understanding of qualitative methods, theoretical models of health behavior, and statistical tools.  Dr. Patel's advisory committee will consist of a primary mentor (Dr Abbey Berenson, MD, PhD) and 2 co- mentors (Dr. Deborah Thompson, PhD, and Dr. Peggy Smith, PhD). Dr. Berenson is a pediatric obstetrician gynecologist at UTMB with more than 20 years of experience in adolescent contraceptive research, having maintained federal support since 1994. Dr. Thompson is a senior faculty member at the Baylor College of Medicine with more than 15 years of experience leading research in designing and testing web-based programs to promote positive behaviors in children and adolescents. Dr. Thompson has received funding through the NIH and USDA, including 2 R01 awards. Dr. Smith is a professor in the Departments of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Psychology, and Pediatrics at the Baylor College of Medicine and is the director of the Baylor Teen Health System, a system of 10 clinics that provides adolescent healthcare annually to more than 20,000 inner city teens across the Houston metropolitan area.  The proposed project will obtain testimonials on LARC use, via semistructured interviews from teenagers who use LARC. These testimonials will then be narrated by teen actors and converted into professional videos. Teen focus groups will be used to choose the most culturally effective narratives for the final intervention. These videos will be uploaded onto an electronic tablet so they can be viewed conveniently in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). Future application through a web-based platform or delivery in nonmedical facilities can increase viewership and promote preventive healthcare in the community setting. The combination of experiences from this research project and the resources described in the career development plan will enable Dr. Patel to complete an R01 application to perform a larger RCT to test the intervention, leading her to an early career as an independent investigator."
"9450447","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging is a major risk factor for both the development of primary tuberculosis (TB) disease and for the conversion of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection to active TB disease. As a consequence, persons over the age of 65 have the highest TB case rate and are the most susceptible to TB associated death. The immunological factors that contribute to the increased susceptibility of the elderly to TB remain largely unknown. The overarching hypothesis of this program project is that specific changes in inflammatory pathways (termed inflammaging) mediate unique and sub-optimal re-programming in pulmonary and systemic immunity during aging, and worsen the outcome of M.tb infection in the elderly. Project 1 will analyze how pulmonary surfactant and complement contribute to the loss of alveolar complexity within the aging lung and modify the initial cellular interaction with M.tb. Project 2 will address age-associated changes in the function of alveolar macrophages and how they affect M.tb infection. Project 3 will determine the impact of aging and inflammaging on control of primary and latent M.tb infection in old mice. Project 4 will investigat M.tb specific monocyte and T cell function in elderly subjects with latent or active TB. Altogether, these studies will provide mechanistic information to understand how inflammaging and immune senescence impact M.tb infection in the elderly. The program brings together an established group of collaborative scientists with expertise in clinical TB, TB pathogenesis and the immune response to infection, the latter both in human and animal models."
"9479717","UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research."
"9494041","Project Summary/Abstract Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients represent a defined population in which approximately 50% of patients will develop new-onset post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) and in whom the development of diabetes increases the risk of death 3-fold. The propagation of pre-diabetes to frank hyperglycemia occurs when pancreatic ?-cells can no longer meet the insulin demand needed for glucose homeostasis. Loss of IL-33/serum STimulation-2 (ST2) signaling and depletion of ST2+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in visceral adipose tissue exacerbates ?-cell exhaustion by increasing both Th1-mediated inflammation and insulin resistance. In a cohort of HCT recipients, we demonstrated that PTDM development was characterized by: 1) elevated fasting C-peptide levels prior to transplant; 2) impaired islet response to hyperglycemia and GLP-1 after HCT with decreased ?-cell insulin secretion and blunted ?-cell suppression, and 3) increased post-transplant serum levels of soluble ST2 (sST2), a decoy receptor which sequesters IL-33. We hypothesize that in PTDM, initial ?-cell compensation progresses to exhaustion during the course of HCT, which coincides with increased tissue demand for insulin due to changes in IL-33 signaling, inflammation, and/or hyperglucagonemia. The following aims will test islet cell and ST2 regulation during PTDM. Aim 1. To determine if changes in islet cell physiology are detectable before or after matched related donor (MRD) HCT in patients developing new-onset PTDM. Utilizing a hyperglycemic clamp, we will directly measure insulin secretory capacity before and 90 days after MRD HCT to determine the timing and role of ?-cell dysfunction in the development of new-onset PTDM (Subaim 1A). To assess ?-cell dysregulation, glucose-induced glucagon suppression will be measured during a hyperglycemic clamp and during 2 oral glucose tolerance tests either with or without GLP-1 infusion (Subaim 1B). In Aim 2 we will define the role of the IL-33/ST2 axis in immune/islet cell dysregulation during PTDM by measuring adipose and plasma levels of IL-33 and sST2 and quantifying ST2 expression on circulating Tregs and Th1 cells. IL-33 effects will be assessed in vitro to determine whether T cell proliferation or inflammatory cytokine production differs among patients with or without PTDM or whether IL-33 directly decreases human islet insulin secretion and viability. PTDM is highly prevalent in HCT survivors, however the cause, pathophysiology, and optimal management are unclear. By studying the physiology and immunology of PTDM, this proposal will uncover new connections between metabolic complications and immune regulation while simultaneously identifying novel targets for intervention. Longer term, data from these mechanistic studies will be translated into therapeutic clinical trials to test pharmacologic interventions for the prevention and treatment of PTDM."
"9459866","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will define signaling mechanisms associated with the extreme anterior domain (EAD) and face formation using the frogs Xenopus laevis and X. tropicalis as models. The EAD is a conserved embryonic region where ectoderm and endoderm are juxtaposed, that develops into the mouth, anterior pituitary and nostrils. In the previous funding period, we made several novel findings. (1) The EAD is an organizing center necessary for cranial neural crest (CNC) development, using the Kinin-Kallikrein pathway and nitric oxide (NO); (2) Incoming CNC induces the EAD to undergo convergent extension, a novel step in mouth formation, using the Wnt/PCP pathway; (3) Wnt antagonists frzb1+crescent that are localized in the EAD act globally, in other facial regions. Our data give insight into the earliest stages of facial development and suggest two hypotheses with high impact that will be addressed in this proposal. Wnt antagonists from the EAD regulate frontonasal prominence (FNP) and first arch CNC development. The EAD signals through Bradykinin and nitric oxide to regulate CNC migration, in a concentration-dependent manner. There are two Aims. The first Aim will delineate the role of Frzb1+Crescent derived from the EAD in neural crest development. The role(s) of EAD-derived Frzb1+Crescent in FNP and first arch CNC determination, migration, proliferation and survival will be assessed after local loss of function (LOF). X. tropicalis mutants will complement and extend analyses. Frzb1+Crescent will be assayed for sufficiency to direct neural crest development, using heterologous cells expressing Frzb1 or beads soaked in Frzb-IgG protein. Ability of Frzb1+Crescent to inhibit ?-catenin-mediated Wnt reporter activity in the FNP and first arch CNC will be assessed. Signaling pathways and candidate target genes modulated by frzb1+crescent will be determined. The second Aim will define the role of the EAD and the Kinin-Kallikrein pathway in modulating nitric oxide (NO) signaling and CNC migration. Cells in the developing facial region which produce NO will be identified, using the NO sensor DAF2 and NO-sensor nanotubes. A requirement for the EAD and EAD Kinin-Kallikrein factors in facial NO production will be assessed by extirpation and local LOF. cCNC cells will be assayed for ability to respond directly to Bdk peptides or NO in the embryo or in culture. Downstream effects of NO on target cells will be examined focusing on changes in signaling pathways and the cytoskeleton. The face is the defining feature of the individual human. Facial abnormalities are frequent (~1/700 births), resulting in physical and psychological disturbances. Much of the face may be impacted by reduced activity of the EAD organizer. The data obtained here will inform pre-natal diagnosis and correction, and are highly significant in the craniofacial field."
"9524372","The ability of cancer to develop resistance to therapy is a major health problem which was identified recently by the NCI Cancer Moonshoot initiative as a priority research topic. A critical barrier to progress in dealing with the problem of cancer therapy is the lack of drugs that reverse therapeutic resistance and block the supportive actions of the tumor microenvironment. Our previous research began addressing this need by identifying the autotaxin (ATX)?lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) axis as a fundamental system that regulates therapeutic resistance in various cancer stem-like cells (CSC) and mediates metastasis by reprogramming cells in the tumor microen- vironment (TME); and we developed drug candidate leads that inhibit ATX, which we will advance toward human trials. The next phase of our studies will expedite clinical availability and FDA approval of our lead ATX inhibitors. Our goal is to address cancer resistance to therapy by determining the mechanism of ATX upregulation in cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and to evaluate the therapeutic utility of four high-potency small-molecule inhibitors of ATX that we have developed during the previous funding period. Our central hypothesis is that transcriptional upregulation of ATX is responsible for the development of thera- peutic resistance by CSC and for reprogramming cells of the TME to provide a niche that is more conducive to invasion and metastasis. Our preliminary data suggest that our small-molecule ATX inhibitor leads will restore therapeutic sensitivity of CSC and also block ATX in the TME, which will enhance tumor cell killing and prevent the spread of cancer. Our objectives are: 1) Determine the cellular sources of ATX in the TME to pave the way to cell-targeted therapy against metastasis. 2) Develop an effective drug that simultaneously suppresses ATX in cancer stem cells proper and also in cells of the TME. This dual targeting will hit neoplastic cells at two of the most problematic areas of current cancer therapy: re- sistance and metastasis. Our expected outcomes will include: 1) validation that ATX is a new target in cancer treatment; 2) identification of the cellular targets that are sources of ATX in the TME; 3) identification of the signaling pathway of ATX upregulation in cancer-associated fibroblasts; and 4) evaluation of four new ATX inhibitor leads as a first-in-class drug candidate family. Our impact will include the preclinical validation of the most efficacious ATX inhibitor compound among our leads for submission in the NCI I-SPY Phase 1 human trial program as adjuvants to chemo- and radiation ther- apy. Our mechanism of action studies will also identify additional new drug targets that can block ATX expres- sion. We vigorously will seek industry partnerships/licensing to expedite clinical trials and regulatory approval."
"9462231","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major psychoses (SZ, SAD, BDP), when defined by clinical phenomenology alone, overlap extensively on neurobiological, biomarker, co-morbid, symptomatic, and genetic characteristics. Our field may benefit from transformational re-conceptualizations of disease seen in other areas of medicine when biological variables are considered in disease definitions and identification. This approach in psychiatry will depend on: (i) use of well- defined disease domains, (ii) large samples that capture clinical heterogeneity and support statistical approaches, and (iii) ability to acquire quantifiable laboratory measures t inform re-conceptualization of disease characteristics. The 5-site B-SNIP focus is psychosis, an ideal clinical phenotype for this purpose. B- SNIP1 recruited over 2500 volunteers and performed dense phenotyping across multiple levels of analysis (cognitive, psychophysiological, brain imaging, social and clinical). The overall data described a continuum of phenotypic alterations across the DSM psychosis diagnoses (BDP, SAD, SZ) with little evidence of diagnostic specificity. In an attempt to use these dense phenotypic characteristics to define biologically based subgroups, we re-grouped probands using biomarkers and a multistage multivariate analysis procedure. We identified 3 psychosis Biotypes based on core phenotypic features. Biotypes showed unique differences across external validators that were not used in the initial construction of the categories. B-SNIP2 will replicate and extend B- SNIP1 using enhanced proband number, biomarker panel, and sophistication of multivariate statistical approaches. We will accomplish our goals within the context of two specific aims. SA(1) Construct a 'Psychosis Biomarker Database' (PBD): Recruit 3000 new psychosis probands and 600 healthy volunteers and collect data including clinical, psychosocial, electrophysiological, ocular motor, imaging and blood biomarkers. Core biomarkers (used for Biotype definition) and external validators (used for verifying neurobiological distinctiveness of Biotypes) will be collected as specified. Genetic characteristics of the participants will be obtained in collaboratin with the Broad Institute. SA(2) Contrast and test taxometric approaches to categorizing psychosis: Evaluate the ability of different taxonomic structures to define psychosis subgroups, based on data in the PBD: (i) DSM, (ii) B-SNIP2 biotypes based on clinical variables, (iii) B-SNIP1 Biotypes, (iv) B-SNIP2-generated biotypes based on biomarkers, and (v) B-SNIP2 biotypes based on both clinical variables and biomarkers. Beginning with traditional DSM diagnostic criteria as the taxonomy and testing (i)-(v) we will use linear, quadratic and nonparametric discriminant function analysis applied to external biomarker validators to examine the association between the traditional diagnostic system and the biologically- derived classification (imaging, psychosocial and genetic external validators). We will be able to determine the strongest taxonomic approach based on biological characteristics. We seek a rational classification of psychotic disorders that will be successful in identifying novel disease targets and treatments approaches."
"9637233","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main focus of our research has been to understand the biological functions of two highly related signaling molecules, myostatin (MSTN, GDF-8) and GDF-11, which we discovered in a screen for new transforming growth factor-ß family members. We showed that mice lacking MSTN have dramatic increases in skeletal muscle mass throughout the body, and we and others showed that systemic administration of MSTN inhibitors to mice can promote muscle growth, showing that MSTN acts to limit muscle growth postnatally. Hence, there is extensive interest in targeting MSTN to enhance muscle strength and regeneration, and at least 7 biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are in phase II/III clinical trials testing myostatin inhibitors in a wide range of disease settings. We showed that GDF-11 plays an important role in axial patterning and in kidney development, and other groups subsequently showed that GDF-11 also regulates the development of the nervous system and pancreas. Gdf11 is expressed widely in adult tissues, and recent studies have suggested that GDF-11 may play an important role in aging. Specifically, circulating GDF-11 levels were reported to decrease with age, and administration of GDF-11 protein to aged mice was reported to reverse age-related tissue dysfunction in the heart, skeletal muscle, and nervous system. Some of these findings have since been challenged by a paper reporting that GDF-11 levels increase with aging and that GDF-11 has a detrimental effect on skeletal muscle regeneration. These findings have raised new questions regarding the roles of MSTN and GDF-11 in adult animals as well as the potential strategies for manipulating the activities of these molecules for clinical applications. A major question in this regard is whether the distinct functions of MSTN and GDF-11 reflect the inherent biochemical differences between these highly related molecules or whether their distinct functions simply reflect their differing pattern of expression. The overall goal of this project is to understand the basis for the distinct functios of these molecules. This project is a continuation of our long-standing effort to understand the mechanisms underlying the regulation and signaling of MSTN and GDF-11 and will utilize the many genetic and biochemical tools that we have developed over many years to target the various components of this regulatory network. The Specific Aims are: to compare the activities of MSTN and GDF-11 in vitro with respect to the roles of known signaling components, including inhibitory binding proteins and receptors; to examine the roles of these binding proteins and receptors in regulating skeletal and cardiac muscle growth and function and skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo; and to carry out gene knock-in experiments in mice in which the MSTN coding sequence is replaced with GDF-11 (and vice versa). The results of these experiments should provide key insights into the mechanistic basis underlying the distinct biological functions that MSTN and GDF-11 carry out in vivo. We believe that these studies will be crucial for developing strategies to exploit the activities of these molecules for therapeutic intervention."

"9460543","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The role of EVI1-induced hypermethylation in leukemogenesis  A growing number of recurrent somatic mutations that lead to aberrant DNA methylation are identified in cancer and specifically myeloid malignancies, including Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and  Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Aberrant epigenetic modification has emerged as a key mechanism that promotes leukemogenesis. The molecular mechanisms behind aberrant DNA methylation remain elusive. The role of Ecotropic Virus Integration-1 (EVI1) in leukemogenesis has been well established. Ecotropic virus integration-1 (EVI1) plays an oncogenic role in a variety of myeloid neoplasms, including MDS and AML in adults. EVI1 high expression is also detected in 10-25% of pediatric and young adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), and it is associated with an intermediate to unfavorable prognosis. Notably, overexpression of EVI1 in murine bone marrow cells in vivo induces MDS/AML. EVI1 overexpression (EVI1+) has been associated with an aberrant hypermethylation signature in AML. Our recent studies revealed that EVI1 activation resulted in aberrant hypermethylation of miR-9 promoter and deregulates the miR-9-mediated FOXO3 pathway. Of relevance to leukemogenesis, restoration of miR-9 expression reversed EVI1-mediated suppression of myelopoiesis in vitro. In the AML patients, we found that EVI1 activation is positively associated with FOXO3 expression. Similar to miR-9, miR124 is also inhibited by EVI1-induced hypermethylation. We hypothesize that EVI1-induced DNA hypermethylation plays a central role in EVI1-induced AML through deregulating the miR-9/miR-124-mediated oncogenic pathways. As EVI1 plays a critical role in maintenance of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and leukemia-initiating cells (LICs), we will focus on understanding the role of EVI1-induced hypermethylation in transformation of  HSPCs into LICs. We will 1) determine how EVI1 activation induces DNA hypermethylation; 2) determine  the role of miR-9 and miR-124 in normal hematopoiesis and EVI1-induced AML using animal models; 3) identify novel oncogenic pathways that regulated by miR-9 and miR124 and determine the role of these  pathways in EVI1-induced AML. We expect that our studies will provide insights into the novel molecular mechanisms by which EVI1 activation deregulates self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation of HSPCs and causes genetic instability. The targeted therapy for EVI1(+) AML is still unavailable. Our studies likely lead to the identification of more effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of EVI1(+) AML by  targeting the critical molecular pathways that are affected by EVI1-induced DNA hypermethylation."
"9451232","Project Summary NIA has established the National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) as a national genetics data repository in order to facilitate access by qualified investigators to genotypic data for the study of the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). It is the policy of the NIA that all Genetic Data derived from NIA funded studies for the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer's disease be deposited at NIAGADS or another NIA approved site or both whenever possible. NIAGADS is also the Data Coordinating Center for Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), a White House/NIH initiative to identify new genetic variants by sequencing genomes/exomes of ~15,000 AD patients and cognitively normal controls. In the second funding period, NIAGADS will continue its mission as the national repository for AD genetics with these proposed activities: (1) receive and organize AD genetics datasets for community access, (2) coordinate data production and support analysis activities for ADSP, (3) develop the AD Genomics Information Gateway (AD-GIG), an integrated information platform for researchers to access AD knowledge, data, and other resources at NIAGADS more easily, (4) expand NIAGADS resource by interfacing with other research initiatives, and (5) promote community involvement with an active outreach program."
"9566857","PROJECT SUMMARY Osteoporosis is the most common aging-related metabolic bone disease mainly characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and deteriorated bone quality/strength. Peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) can not only act as precursors of osteoclasts but also produce cytokines important for osteoclast differentiation and function, and thus represent major systemic cells for bone metabolism. DNA methylation as an important epigenetic regulator of gene expression may have significant and potential sex-specific effects in the etiology of complex diseases. However, the significance of global DNA methylation profiles underlying osteoporosis risk is largely unknown, particularly in males who suffer significantly higher morbidity and mortality rates upon osteoporotic fractures than females. Our General Hypothesis is that altered DNA methylation profiles in PBMs and the associated changes in gene expression and osteoclastogenesis contribute to peak BMD and bone quality/strength variation in males. Our Goals/Expectations are to 1) identify and characterize, at the epigenome-wide level, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in PBMs associated with osteoporosis risk in Caucasian males; 2) ascertain the DNA methylation mediated epigenetic mechanisms of osteoporosis, that is, how the DMRs regulate the expression of the coding/non- coding target genes and subsequent osteoclastogenesis. We will accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1) Identification/validation of DMRs significantly associated with peak BMD and bone quality/strength (QCT and FEA) in Caucasian males. We will perform systematic epigenome- wide and regional focused comparative DNA methylation profiling studies in PBMs of 100 discordant Caucasian males (?Discovery cohort?) at peak bone mass aged 20-30, including half with extremely high BMDs and the other half with extremely low BMDs, and validate the top most significant DMRs in both of the ?Discovery cohort? and an independent ?Replication cohort? of 100 Caucasian males discordant for peak BMDs. 2) Determination of the sex- and ethnic-generality/specificity of the significant DMRs. The replicated DMRs will be tested in three independent samples, including a) 160 Caucasian females (through a DNA methylation study for female osteoporosis, R01AR059781), b) 100 African American males, and c) 160 Chinese males. 3) In-depth molecular investigation of the functional roles of the validated DMRs in regulating coding/non-coding gene expression and osteoclastogenesis. We will identify potential DMR cis-regulated coding/non-coding genes by integrative analyses of DNA methylation data, transcriptomic data (Proj 2), and DNA sequence data (Proj 1) in the same set of PBMs from the same 100 Caucasian males in the Discovery Cohort, and conduct in vitro cell-based functional assays to assess how DNA methylation at these DMRs regulates target gene expression and osteoclastogenesis. This novel project holds a great promise of award to generate breakthroughs in the osteoporosis research field. The results will give new insights into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying osteoporosis. The knowledge gained may ultimately lead to novel approaches to better prevention and treatment of osteoporosis."
"9453577","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of positional plagiocephaly/brachycephaly (PPB) increased dramatically following the Back to Sleep campaign, from 5% to approximately 20%-30%. It has been assumed that PPB is a benign side effect of supine sleep positioning and that skull deformation would resolve as children mature. However, several studies now challenge these assumptions. In a recently completed longitudinal study, we found that children with PPB were at elevated risk for developmental delays relative to unaffected controls from infancy through age 36 months. Although it is unclear whether PPB causes developmental delays, we hypothesize that PPB is a marker that could be used to identify infants in need of developmental assessment and intervention. Specifically, we anticipate that early and potentially subtle neuromotor deficits make infants vulnerable to developing PPB and predict deficits in other areas of development.  This study will be the first long-term follow-up of children with and without PPB. We will re-assess children who participated in our earlier cohort study with PPB (n=215) and unaffected controls (n=163) at age 8 years. The study will explore two primary hypotheses: (1) Children with PPB will score lower than unaffected controls on neuropsychological and academic achievement measures, and (2) These differences are mediated by infant motor skills. We will also examine the demographic and clinical variables that predict development in children with PPB. Finally, we will examine whether differences in head shape remain measureable and observable for children with PPB versus unaffected controls."
"9459995","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide is the 3rd leading cause of death in the US ages between 15-34 years and about one million people commit suicide every year world-wide. Thus, there is a desperate need for identifying risk factors and for non- invasive, reliable biomarkers that can be used for early detection of suicidality and treatment response. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as an important class of small non-coding RNAs that bind to 3' UTR of mRNAs and suppress the translation and/or stability of specific target genes. Since miRNAs show a highly regulated expression, they contribute in the development and maintenance of a specific transcriptome and thus have the unique ability to influence physiological and disease phenotypes. Our recent studies show that the expression of a group of miRNAs is altered in brain of depressed subjects and that they are involved in coping response to stress. In addition, our preliminary data indicate that a subset of miRNAs is specifically altered in brain of suicide subjects regardless of psychopathology, suggesting that miRNAs can distinguish suicidality. Recently, circulating miRNAs are under intense investigation and have been extremely useful in detecting and following the course of various diseases. Neural miRNAs are responsive to environmental, synaptic, and pathological changes and can be actively secreted by cells such as exosomes from brain into blood. These exosomes bear cell-type specific surface markers. Using a neural specific surface marker, we successfully isolated neural-derived exosomes and found that these exosomes are enriched with miRNAs/mRNAs that are expressed in brain. Using this novel approach we aim to examine whether neural- derived exosomal miRNAs are differentially expressed that are specific to suicidal ideation or behavior, and which by affecting specific mRNA targets and pathways, are associated with suicidal behavior and response to ketamine. We will examine the following groups of subjects: 1) major depressive disorder (MDD) with a recent suicide attempt (in past 2 weeks), 2) MDD with serious ideation without recent suicide attempt (in the past 6 months), 3) MDD without clinically significant suicidal ideation or suicide attempt in the past 6 months, and 4) healthy controls. Both suicidal and non-suicidal MDD will be given ketamine (0.5 mg/kg, IV) and blood drawn at 30 and 180 min post-infusion to measure changes in miRNAs. We also propose a parallel human postmortem brain study to examine whether changes in miRNAs in suicidality correspond to miRNA changes in brain by comparing dlPFC and hippocampus from MDD suicide, MDD non-suicide, and control subjects. With this we attempt to achieve: 1) whether suicidal ideation or behavior is associated with differences in the expression of specific miRNAs, 2) whether anti-suicidal/antidepressant effects of ketamine is associated with miRNAs changes, and 3) whether miRNA/mRNA-regulatory pathways contribute to suicide pathogenesis and treatment response. Our study will provide a novel avenue for the development of miRNAs as ''molecular tool'' to identify suicidality and treatment response and in generating target based therapies to treat this devastating disorder."
"9464569","Project Summary/Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects a sizeable proportion of the American population and is associated with severe psychological suffering and impairment. Evidence suggests that individuals with PTSD have an impairment in attention in the presence of threat information, often described as an attentional bias for threat. It is thought that this attentional bias serves to maintain and exacerbate PTSD symptoms. While a bottom-up (i.e., more automatic, sensory-driven) attentional bias to threat has been studied extensively in PTSD, relatively little is known about the role of top-down (i.e., more controlled, effortful, and goal-directed) attentional processes in this line of research. Theory and preliminary evidence suggests that attentional control processes (inhibition, shifting, working memory updating) may be used to override bottom-up, or more reactive attentional bias to threat. Thus, these cognitive processes may be used to alleviate trauma-related distress in the short-term, and perhaps, over longer periods of time as well. The proposed study will utilize innovative translational research methods to elucidate the cross-sectional and prospective roles that top-down cognitive processes play in threat-related attentional bias in PTSD. The use of three assessment sessions, over the course of one year, will allow us to determine the degree to which the use of these cognitive processes to regulate threat-related attentional biases is adaptive over a prolonged period of time. Moreover, we will remedy several limitations of previous research by (a) using state-of-the-art eye-tracking equipment to provide a reliable continuous measurement of attentional biases, (b) measuring the specific components of attentional control via behavioral tasks, and (c) examining both positive and negative emotionally arousing images. Adult participants (2 groups [Trauma-exposed Control and PTSD]) will complete a battery of self-report questionnaires, an eye tracking task, and a comprehensive battery of behavioral measures assessing multiple domains of effortful cognitive processes at a single laboratory session. Additionally, participants will complete all of the self-report measures administered at the laboratory session at two follow-up sessions, six and twelve months after the laboratory session. This study is innovative in that it seeks to examine the interactive effect of top-down and bottom-up attentional processes in order to explicate the nature of threat-related attentional biases in PTSD. This innovative approach, using objective behavioral measures of top-down cognitive processes in combination with eye-tracking equipment, may greatly advance our understanding of the complex nature of threat biases in PTSD, provide more accurate predictions of vulnerability for experiencing prolonged PTSD symptoms, and have important treatment implications. Specifically, identifying the specific cognitive processes that modulate this threat bias may result in the development of clinical interventions that directly target these processes in the service of alleviating trauma-related distress."

The COHCCC Catchment Area includes the entirety of Los Angeles and Orange Counties and portions of Ventura, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties. The Catchment Area is bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the south and west; Antelope Valley to the north; Santa Clarita and Simi Valley to the west; the metropolitan areas of Riverside and San Bernardino to the east; and the communities of Palm Desert, Murrieta, and San Clemente to the south. The COHCCC Catchment Area covers 9,365 square miles and includes the heart of the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area and more inland communities. We serve a multi-racial, multi-ethnic community of over 17.1 million individuals, which represents approximately 40 percent of all Californians. Remarkably, the population of our Catchment Area is greater than the individual populations of 46 states and greater than the populations of 14 states combined. The COHCCC seeks to use its research and resources to improve the lives of the men, women, and children who live in our Catchment Area, particularly in the more inland regions. The residents we serve face challenges that impact cancer survival, including poverty, obesity, and lack of access. These challenges are uniformly faced whether an individual comes from urban or more rural environments. To achieve this goal, COHCCC has three themes:  1. Identify and pursue challenging questions in cancer research relevant to the people of our  Catchment Area.  2. Develop and implement strategies for including underserved populations in our programmatic research.  3. Take advantage of research discoveries, collaborations, networks, and affiliates to extend our  reach and to implement creative interventions to increase access and health equity within our  Catchment Area, as well as nationally and internationally. To reduce the incidence of cancer in the unique populations we serve within our Catchment Area, we identified the following priorities:  ? Biologically aggressive cancers that impact diverse populations in our COHCCC Catchment Area  ? Viral-related cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and HIV-related malignancies  ? Impact of pollution on cancer incidence, with a focus on breast and lung cancer  ? Cancers of aging in Asian- and Latino-Americans"
"9677439","ABSTRACT Proteinuria, commonly caused by podocyte dysfunction or injury, is an invariable finding in patients with glomerular disease and is by itself a risk factor for long-term prognosis. Evidence suggests that the multi- tasking melanocortin hormone system plays a protective role in stress response in multiple organ systems, including the kidney. The clinical effectiveness of melanocortin therapy with adrenocorticotropin in inducing remission of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome points to a steroidogenic-independent anti-proteinuric activity of the melanocortinergic pathway. By harnessing the naturally occurring loss-of-function mutations in melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) in both humans and mice, our latest study demonstrated that MC1R is likely dispensable for the proteinuria-reducing and podocyte protective effect of melanocortin therapy. Rather, we found that MC5R is predominantly expressed in glomerular podocytes in vivo and in vitro, and MC5R agonists seem to confer a podocyte protective effect. Building on our previous work, this study will examine the role of the MC5R-mediated melanocortinergic pathway in regulating podocyte injury, explore the sites and modes of action and test an entirely novel strategy for treating proteinuric glomerulopathies based on targeting this pathway. Aim 1 will define and validate the role of MC5R versus MC1R in mediating the anti-proteinuric and podocyte protective effect by comparing the therapeutic efficacy of diverse melanocortins in wild-type, MC1R- null and MC5R knockout (MC5R-/-) mice with Adriamycin nephropathy or nephrotoxic serum nephritis. The contribution of hematopoietic MC5R to the beneficial effect of melanocortin therapy will be assessed in MC5R-/- mice receiving adoptive transfer of syngeneic wild-type bone marrow-derived cells. Furthermore, the podocyte autonomous effect of MC5R will be examined in MC5R-/- mice with podocyte specific MC5R reconstitution. Aim 2 will explore the mechanisms underlying the podocyte protective effect of MC5R signaling. How melanocortin treatment affects podocyte death, cytoskeleton disorganization and expression of NF?B-dependent podocytopathic mediators will be assessed in conditionally immortalized and primary podocytes. The essential role of MC5R will be defined using primary MC5R-/- podocytes and those with MC5R reconstitution. Studies will further examine if the podocyte protective effect of MC5R signaling is conveyed by inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3?, a key transducer of MC5R signaling and a point of convergence for multiple pathways involved in podocyte injury. Aim 3 will test the rescue effect of a novel and highly selective MC5R agonist on established podocyte injury elicited by Adriamycin or nephrotoxic serum in mice and by puromycin aminonucleoside in rats. The mechanisms responsible for the podocyte protective effect of melanocortinergic signaling will be validated in vivo. Collectively, these studies will provide a mechanistic view of the role of the melanocortinergic pathway in regulating podocyte injury and may pave the way for clinical trials of melanocortin based therapy to improve podocyte injury, induce proteinuria remission and slow progression of glomerulosclerosis in man."
"9601209","The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop an optical-genetic toolbox for reading and writing neural population codes in functional maps of awake, higher mammals. Such tools could ultimately be used to restore perceptual capabilities in patients with damage to peripheral sensory pathways by direct stimulation of early sensory cortex. Advanced optical methods for reading and writing neural codes using genetically-encoded reporters and actuators have become powerful tools for studying neural circuits in rodents. However, rodents are a suboptimal model for human perception because of their vastly different sensory representations and perceptual capabilities. For example, rodents' primary visual cortex (V1) lacks the functional columnar organization which is a hallmark of primate vision. In contrast to rodents, the macaque monkeys' sensory representations and perceptual capabilities are highly similar to those of humans. Furthermore, the behaving macaque provides a unique opportunity to develop and test tools for reading and writing neural codes at the level of functional domains such as the orientation columns in V1. However, multiple technical hurdles remain before the optical-genetic methods currently available in rodents could be readily applied in larger, non- transgenic mammals.  Here we propose to take advantage of the unique expertise of our team members to develop optical techniques that utilize virally delivered transgenes for monitoring and manipulating neural population codes in behaving macaques. Specifically, we will address three technical goals. First, we will develop and test new genetic methods that will provide long-term expression of transgenes in primates with cell-type and activity- dependent specificity. Second, we will develop a two-photon microscope for behaving monkeys that will allow one to monitor these signals with cellular resolution and complement current imaging techniques with larger coverage but coarser resolution. Finally, we will develop methods for writing neural population codes in functional maps by combining patterned light stimulation that target specific functional domains and selective expression of actuators. We will validate and optimize these techniques by linking V1 responses (elicited by both visual and direct patterned optogenetic stimulation) and monkeys' behavior in visual discrimination tasks. The tools that we will develop will enable a deeper understanding of the neural code and a better characterization of the capabilities and limitations of methods for reading and writing neural population codes in functional maps in humans."
"9461103","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this application is to understand the working mechanism of a supramolecular machinery, termed divisome, in carrying out bacterial cell division. The divisome is composed of more than thirty proteins that are orchestrated to assemble and function at the correct time and space to ensure successful cytokinesis. Understanding key rate-limiting steps in this process and how different proteins coordinate with each other is important to provide potential new antimicrobial targets for treating bacterial infections. In the past a major focus of the field is on the role of the essential component of the divisome, a ring-like structure (Z-ring) formed by the tubulin homolog protein FtsZ, in generating a mechanic force to constrict the membrane actively. The roles of the other two components of the divisome, septal cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis machinery and chromosome segregation machinery, are thought to follow the active contraction of Z-ring. Recently accumulating evidence suggests that the Z-ring may not be the main force generator but a key regulator/mediator, and that cell wall synthesis and chromosome segregation machineries have larger roles in driving septum closure than Z-ring contraction.  The project described here will examine this hypothesis using a combination of single-molecule imaging, genetic, biochemical and structural methods. The first Aim is to determine the role of the Z-ring in the spatiotemporal organization of septal PG proteins. The dynamics and organizations in wild-type FtsZ cells will then be compared to those in mutant cells harboring Z-rings with altered structures, dynamics, GTPase activity, and protein-proteins interactions. The second Aim is to determine the role of septal PG synthesis in driving septum closure. Septal PG synthesis will be systematically perturbed using targeted mutations and drug treatments, and the corresponding time-dependent septum closure rate, septal PG incorporation rate, septa morphology and composition will be measured using a variety of single-molecule imaging and biochemical methods. The third Aim is to determine the structural basis responsible for the coordination between chromosome segregation and septum closing. Molecular interfaces between a suite of proteins that interact with each other and anchor the Z-ring to the chromosome will be determined using genetic, biochemical, computational and structural methods.  The expected outcomes of the project are: (1) a high-resolution structural and dynamic model of the full E. coli divisome, (2) a redefined roles and relative contributions of the three major divisome components in cytokinesis, (3) molecular insight into the working mechanism of the divisome as a whole, and (4) a set of innovative imaging- based tools and assays enabling bacterial cell biologists."
"9463346","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a degenerative muscle wasting disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. The absence of dystrophin protein in muscle results in dysregulated secondary signaling pathways, many of which remain poorly understood. The laboratory of Dr. Mayana Zatz has identified two dystrophin-deficient dogs from a litter of Golden Retriever Muscular Dystrophy (GRMD) dogs that are mildly affected and escape the early lethality and dystrophic phenotype (muscle wasting) that normally occur in severely affected GRMD dogs. Our microarray analysis of these dogs and other GRMD and control dogs, revealed a strong reduction of the Pitpna gene, which is a known regulator of the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway. In parallel studies using microRNA microarrays performed on human biopsies from patients with DMD, we identified a microRNA, miR-486, that is exclusively reduced in DMD muscle and has been shown by us and others to alter PTEN/AKT signaling. We hypothesize that either overexpression of miR-486 and/or inhibition of Pitpna results in decreased PTEN levels while subsequently increasing phosphorylated (activated) AKT, which might lead to reduced severity of disease course. The induction of phosphorylated-AKT (resulting from miR-486 and Pitpna modulation), are predicted to affect several downstream target genes of this pathway which will result in an increase in muscle hypertrophy, muscle structural genes vascularization genes, the increase in the neuromuscular junction number of branch points, inhibition of apoptosis genes, and validated PTEN/AKT downstream target muscle genes (such as Utrophin). We plan to approach our long-term goal of understanding how these two alter signaling pathways in DMD by modulating expression of miR-486 and/or Pitpna in the mouse (mdx5cv) model according to the following three specific aims: 1) Characterization of miR- 486 and Pitpna regulation of PTEN/AKT signaling pathway in vitro. 2) Manipulation of miR-486 expression to modulate PTEN/AKT signaling in dystrophin-deficient muscle for modeling of future therapeutics. 3) Generation of mice with reduced Pitpna levels in muscle and characterization of its effects on PTEN/AKT signaling."
"9442836","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     A central goal in modern neurobiology is to understand the neural mechanism by which sensory stimuli of the external world is converted into meaningful actions. The vast majority of external stimuli do not have inherent valence or behavioral significance. Instead those qualities are imposed on the stimuli through experience. This learning component plays a broader role in animals with imposed social structures. Increasingly sophisticated tools in anatomical, genetic and molecular methods as well as optogenetics and optical recordings are providing unprecedented understanding of circuit structures and function in brains of all kinds. However, how these circuits are interacting with neuromodulators to produce learned behaviors is not well understood. Here, we propose to identify neural circuits that are responsible for the generation of social learning using anatomic, genetic, molecular and behavioral tools. We will use known piriform circuitry to identify the neural substrates on which social meaning is imposed on sensory stimuli. Further, we will delineate the pathway by moving forward in the circuit to identif output regions responsible for producing behavior. Finally, these experiments will allow the mapping of nodes at which the neuromodulator oxytocin interacts with the olfactory circuitry, providing us a more complete picture - neural circuits and neuromodulatory cues - of how the brain translates sensory representations to meaningful behavior through learning. We believe that the circuit identified through this proposal would serve as an ideal platform to address how oxytocin interacts with mechanisms of adaptation and mal-adaptation during social learning. Furthermore, although we ask these questions in the context of olfactory circuits, oxytocin and social behaviors, the results will have a broad impact across neurobiology, from the studying of sensory coding to neuromodulators."
"9462620","Abstract  Recent improvements in humanized mice can now provide HIV investigators with small animal models  enabling them to study more of the important aspects of HIV infection than previously possible, including  mucosal transmission of virus, the generation of anti-HIV immune responses, and the development of viral  latency. The Animal and Laboratory Core (Core B) will provide this U19 Program with ?BLT? (bone  marrow?liver?thymus) humanized mice, generated by surgically implanting human fetal thymic and liver tissue  under the renal capsules of immunodeficient mice, concurrently with the intravenous transfer of autologous  human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We and/or others have demonstrated that in these BLT mice: 1) the  bone marrow niche is occupied with human HSCs that support human hematopoiesis; 2) latent reservoirs of  infection develop following HIV mucosal transmission; and 3) virus-specific cellular immune responses are  generated in HIV infection that recapitulate HLA-restricted immunodominance patterns of human infection and  have already demonstrated some capacity to constrain HIV replication. These mice will therefore provide  Project 1, 2 and 3 investigators with a uniquely suitable small animal model in which to develop and  preclinically evaluate a ?Defend and Destroy? approach to a functional cure of HIV infection. By using  CRISPER/Cas to re-engineer both autologous HSCs and CD8+ T cells, these investigators propose to develop  the ability to defend target cells arising from the edited HSCs against HIV infection, and to destroy latent HIV  reservoirs by generating a large, highly activated HIV-specific cellular immune response with edited T cells.  Core B will generate BLT mice for all experiments using them that are proposed in Projects 1, 2 and 3 of this  U19 Program application. As called for by different experiments, these BLT mice will be generated either with  unmanipulated or with genetically manipulated HSCs. Core B will perform all treatments of BLT mice called  for, including HIV infection, administration of anti-retroviral therapies (ART), and adoptive transfer of genetically  manipulated HSCs or CD8+ T cells. Core B will also acquire all peripheral blood samples from live uninfected  and HIV-infected mice, and blood and tissues from mice at the time of sacrifice. A strong safety plan is in  place to minimize the risk of HIV exposure to Core personnel performing BLT HIV infections and analyses of  HIV-infected BLT mice, and emergency procedures are in place in case any exposure does occur. Finally,  Core B will also provide virologic support to Projects 1, 2 and 3, generating and titering the stocks of HIV used  to infect BLT mice, and measuring plasma and tissue viral loads in HIV-infected mice by qRT-PCR."
"9479603","Project Summary: ?Dissecting unique functions of IgM and IgD BCRs in tolerance and autoimmunity?  The prototypical autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by anti- nuclear autoantibodies (ANAs) that serve not only as critical biomarkers of disease, but also play a central role in pathogenesis. Surprisingly, despite central tolerance mechanisms such as receptor editing and deletion of autoreactive B cells during bone marrow development, up to 30% of mature human B cells nevertheless harbor some degree of ANA-reactivity. This suggests that additional peripheral tolerance mechanisms must keep such potentially dangerous clones in check. We have recently characterized a novel fluorescent reporter mouse line, Nur77-eGFP, that is sensitive to antigen-dependent B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in vivo. The most highly fluorescent naïve B cells from these mice have recognized endogenous antigen, and are enriched for ANA- reactivity. The Nur77-eGFP reporter thus identifies ANA-reactive B cells in a diverse, normal repertoire, enabling us to track and isolate such cells. We have shown that these ANA-reactive B cells down-regulate expression of the IgM isotype BCR, resulting in dampened responses to IgM stimulation. However, naïve B cells uniquely express a second BCR isotype, IgD, with the same epitope-binding domain as IgM. In contrast to IgM, IgD expression and signaling in ANA-reactive B cells are unperturbed. How does IgM downregulation limit autoimmune responses to self-antigens despite high IgD expression? Each BCR isotype alone is capable of mediating B cell development and responses to immunization with model antigens. In contrast to such apparent redundancy, we have new preliminary data to show that B cells lacking IgM and expressing only IgD are completely prevented from contributing to autoantibody production in a mouse model of SLE. It has recently been shown that IgM, but not IgD, is uniquely sensitive to monovalent antigens. However, relevant nucleic acid-associated autoantigens in SLE are thought to be membrane associated and multivalent suggesting that other distinctive properties of IgM may be important for autoantibody production. In this proposal we intend to identify the mechanisms by which IgM and IgD differentially regulate B cells in the context of health and disease. To do so: (1) We will take advantage of mice deficient for either IgM or IgD to explore how B cells expressing each isotype alone are recruited to secrete pathogenic autoantibodies in two models of systemic autoimmunity with distinct disease mechanisms (Lyn-/- and BAFF Tg). (2) We will determine how the IgM and IgD BCRs traffic to endosomal compartments to recruit costimulatory signals via TLRs7/9 and via MHCII presentation of antigen to T cells. (3) We will explore how differential coupling of IgM and IgD to B cell stimulatory and inhibitory co-receptors alters downstream signaling and contributes to B cell tolerance. Together these studies will define how IgM down-modulation limits B cell responses to self- antigens. This tolerance checkpoint may represent a novel target for therapeutic intervention to re- establish immune homeostasis in patients with SLE and other autoantibody-mediated diseases."
"9448698","ABSTRACT There is an enormous economic and social burden of lung disease that demands improved tools to diagnose, stage, and follow treatment response. To assess heterogeneous and localized pulmonary diseases, cross- sectional imaging is often performed, most commonly with computed tomography (CT) or radioactive tracers (SPECT/PET). While these techniques provide structural and functional information, respectively, they deliver considerable radiation dose which limits use in radiosensitive and pediatric populations. This proposal aims to shift the current clinical practice paradigms for pulmonary imaging by making magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) a valuable modality for lung imaging. MRI delivers no ionizing radiation and can thus be used for longitudinal follow-up or screening in radio-sensitive populations. Furthermore, MRI provides multi- parametric contrast based on microstructure, ventilation, perfusion, cellular metabolism, and inflammation that can improve the assessment of lung diseases. Unfortunately, the radiation-free and multi-parametric benefits of MRI are not currently clinically available for lung imaging due to low signal in the lung and sensitivity to motion with current imaging methods. Recent developments by our group and others have demonstrated that the MRI acquisition paradigm can be modified to enable dramatic improvements in the visualization of the lung that rival CT in ventilated and cooperative subjects with the added benefit of providing improved soft tissue contrast. However, patients often suffer from poor lung function and/or have difficulty with compliance, which leads to complex, irregular breathing and bulk motion that cannot be handled by current MRI techniques. We propose a next generation of pulmonary MRI techniques that are designed to address and overcome the limitations of motion and low lung signal while also incorporating multiple MR soft tissue contrast mechanisms. These address all aspects of MRI scanning including patient preparation and experience, the MRI acquisition, and the reconstruction of images from the data. Specifically, we develop an audiovisual biofeedback system to improve the patient experience while also reducing the likelihood for complex motion, develop multi-contrast MRI sampling strategies which maximize embedded motion information, and create a reconstruction architecture which leverages the MRI data directly to estimate and correct for motion even in the case of complex motion. These methods would be beneficial for characterizing numerous diseases of the lung, both in pediatric and adult populations, including pulmonary nodules, pulmonary embolism, interstitial fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, COPD, asthma, and pulmonary infection. They will have the most significant impact in pediatrics, where there is an urgent need to limit ionizing radiation exposure. Anticipating applications to this population, we have included a broad evaluation in pediatric subjects and a specific pediatric imaging evaluation of pulmonary nodules from other primary malignancies. These nodule evaluations are most common use of pediatric chest CT at our institutions, and thus represent a substantial opportunity for dose reduction."
"9455753","The Wnt pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway present in metazoans from Drosophila to humans. Wnt signaling has been shown to play important roles in development. Given that the Wnt pathway is involved in the genesis of a wide variety of human diseases (e.g., over 90% of all colorectal cancers), there is an intense effort to develop therapeutics that target this pathway. Unfortunately, in part due to our incomplete understanding of the detailed mechanism of Wnt signal transduction, progress in developing therapeutics that target this pathway has been slow, and no Wnt inhibitors are currently in clinical use. Our overarching goal is to understand the basic biochemical mechanisms by which a Wnt signal is propagated to ultimately coordinate the formation of tissues, organs, and limbs and to understand how its misregulation can lead to disease states. In over more than a decade, my laboratory has 1) developed the first biochemical system (Xenopus egg extract) that recapitulated key reactions of the Wnt pathway, 2) developed the first mathematical model (Lee- Heinrich model) of the Wnt pathway, 3) provided evidence for a mechanism involving receptor-mediated signaling (via direct inhibition of GSK3 activity) to the cytoplasm, and 4) identified a small molecule inhibitor of the Wnt pathway that has been designated by the FDA as an orphan drug for a familial precancerous disease (familial adenomatous polyposis). Our recently funded work focuses on 1) our newly proposed model describing how ?-catenin, a Wnt transcriptional coactivator, competes with the corepressor Gro/TLE for binding to the transcriptional factor, TCF/LEF, via a process facilitated by the E3 ligase XIAP and 2) a newly identified mechanism by which loss of the APC tumor suppressor leads to activation of Wnt cell surface receptors. For the MIRA grant application, I propose to extend these studies by 1) determining the molecular mechanism by which APC regulates receptor activation, specifically the role of vesicle transport in this process, and 2) pursuing the characterization of a deubiqutinase, USP47, which interacts with XIAP to promote ?-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling. We have undertaken several genome-scale screens to identify new Wnt pathway genes. Based on the results of these screens, I propose to study 1) Wnt signalosome formation involving the transmembrane and vesicular transport proteins: Arl4c, ITSN1, Syndecan-2, and Cdh13, 2) Wnt receptor homeostasis by the USP46/UAF1/WDR20 deubiquitinase complex, and 3) regulation of Wnt gene transcription by the nuclear kinase STK38."
"9677984","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cellular reprogramming of induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) holds promise as a novel therapy for the treatment of heart failure, a common and morbid disease that is caused by irreversible loss of functional cardiomyocytes (CMs). We and others have showed that in a murine model of acute myocardial infarction, delivery of three transcription factors, Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5, converted endogenous cardiac fibroblasts into functional iCMs. These iCMs integrated electrically and mechanically with surrounding myocardium, resulting in a reduction in scar size and an improvement in heart function. These findings suggest that iCM reprogramming might be a promising novel approach to regenerate functional CMs in vivo for patients with heart disease. However, our limited understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of iCM reprogramming has significantly hindered its clinical applicability. In this proposal, we will take advantage of our expertise in iCM reprogramming, knowledge in developmental biology, unique new tools that we have built to define the molecular mechanisms of how a CM fate is established in a non-CM cell without transiting through the traditional developmental CM specification and differentiation route. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that reprogramming factors Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 act in a stoichiometrically and temporally coordinated fashion upon a privileged subpopulation of CFs to overcome major epigenetic barrier(s) and induce CM fate. Successful completion of this proposal will define the molecular components and determine the optimal condition for iCM reprogramming. Our studies will provide novel insights into fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac cell fate acquisition and cell plasticity regulation."
"9463345","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an adult onset myopathy with epigenetic changes that most commonly occur as a consequence of reduction in the number of 3.3 kb D4Z4 units arrayed on chromosome 4 to less than 11 units. The contraction-induced epigenetic profile results in transcription of the normally repressed DUX4 retrogene and produces myopathic changes that manifest as muscle weakness when contractions occur on arrays with permissive D4Z4 haplotypes. Five percent of FSHD-affected individuals develop FHSD despite having D4Z4 array lengths greater than the 10 unit threshold so FSHD occurring by this mechanism has been called FSHD2 or contraction-independent FSHD. D4Z4 arrays of individuals with FSHD2 show epigenetic de-repression similar to that seen by the more common mechanism but chromatin changes extend to similar arrays on chromosome 10, and the other chromosome 4 allele suggesting that contraction-independent array-derepression may occur through the activity of genes involved in epigenetic modification of macrosatellite repeats. We performed exome sequencing of FSHD2-affected individuals and their unaffected family members to identify one of these loci. Rare variants present in 61% of FSHD2-affected individuals segregated independently of permissive haplotypes on chromosome 4 and only resulted in FSHD when a permissive haplotype and gene variant were present in the same individual. Consistent with our hypothesis, reduction of protein levels from this gene results in D4Z4 array de-repression and DUX4 expression in normal human myoblasts from unaffected individuals. Here we propose to determine the context and timing of these epigenetic changes at D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats, and assess the effect of genes with similar activities on DUX4 transcription in individuals with either FSHD1 or FSHD2. Using this approach we hope to explain disease phenomena such as non-penetrance, variable expressivity, and asymmetric distributions of muscle weakness as well as identify gene targets for possible pharmacological intervention."
"9445388","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of HIV-related cognitive dysfunction remain high, and non-HIV-associated factors are now significant risk modifiers for cognitive impairment and alterations in brain structure. Perhaps most important factor related to the health of Americans with HIV disease is aging. The infection (and its consequences) appear to alter the normal age trajectories of structure or function in virtually all organ systems. In additon to the normal comorbidities that occur in individuals >50 years old, a chronic infection may result in significant burden to the brain, resulting in alterations in cognition and behavior. This concern is confounded by the fact that many individuals >50 years old currently alive with HIV disease were infected during the 1980/90s and endured years of uncontrolled or poorly controlled viral replication. During this five-year renewal period (AG034852), we will expand our current sample to 400 men with an additional 70 men >60 years old. They will undergo two scanning/testing sessions two years apart, resulting in a sample of 350 men with at least two scans, and as many as 280 men with four scans over 13 years. The brain imaging methodologies will assess the integrity of brain gray and white matter and the integrity of brain functional networks, tractography, metabolites, cerebral blood flow, and the integrity of the blood brain barrier. We will utilize these data, in combination with the 15-30 years of prior information from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study to evaluate the relative merits of a general conceptual model of the factors associated with the expression of cognitive and behavioral abnormalities in HIV Disease. We will complete detailed longitudinal analyses of the relationships between markers of subclinical vascular disease, inflammation, brain structure and cognition in the context of aging. We will specifically compare and contrast these relationships in HIV infected and uninfected men in order to address a series of linked hypotheses concerning possible mechanisms that may result in an apparent increase in the rate of cognitive dysfunction among HIV-infected individuals relative to age-matched controls."
"9467222","Project Summary/Abstract  Antibacterial resistance is widespread for all major classes of antibiotics with many bacteria being resistant to multiple, and in some cases all, available antibiotics. To combat this resistance, novel antibiotics are needed. Natural products (NPs) from actinomycetes have traditionally been rich sources for antibiotics, but discovery of novel NPs from these strains via traditional means (i.e. screening crude culture supernatants for antibiotic activity) is rarely effective due to high rates of rediscovery. Whole genome sequencing of actinomycetes has revealed the presence of many unknown biosynthetic gene clusters suggesting the existence of many novel NPs. The Metcalf and Kelleher laboratories recently developed a method for untargeted NP discovery based upon genomic and mass spectrometric analyses (referred to as Natural Product Identification via Mass Spectrometry Based Analyses, NIMBLE). I propose to improve NIMBLE by incorporating computational structure predictions and molecular networking. I will use the improved NIMBLE to discover two novel antibiotic NPs and to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway for the more biologically active of the two.  In Aim 1, twenty novel NPs identified via NIMBLE will be analyzed using computational structure prediction and molecular networking. This analysis will allow for identification of NPs with novel chemical scaffolds (not derivatives of known NPs!). Ten of the NPs with unique structures will be partially purified from their producing organisms and screened for activity against a panel of clinically relevant bacteria. Due to the high percentage of antibiotic NPs (~50% for actinomycete NPs), we expect that at least two antibiotic NPs will be identified. For the two most active NPs, the NIMBLE-predicted associations of the NPs with their biosynthetic gene clusters will be validated using in vivo genetic analysis. The compounds will then be isolated, and their structures will be elucidated. Finally, the purified NPs will be further analyzed for their antibacterial activity. In Aim 2, the biosynthetic pathway for the most potent NP identified in Aim 1 will be deciphered. An advantage of the NIMBLE method is that it allows simultaneous identification of novel NPs and their gene clusters. Having knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway will allow for future engineering of the strain for enhanced production of the NP and production of derivatives that could have improved activity or pharmacokinetic properties. The boundaries of the biosynthetic gene cluster and the functions of the genes within the cluster will be determined via bioinformatics analyses, genetic validation, and if needed, in vitro analysis of the enzymes encoded in the cluster. The order of the pathway will be determined via cross-feeding studies. Overall, this proposal will allow for identification of 2 novel antibiotic natural products and elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway for one of them. More importantly, it will provide a general platform for discovering many more bioactive natural products."
"9462765","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Type 2 diabetes in youth is a growing public health concern, with evidence that it is even more serious in youth than in adults, and a serious concern in minority and poor communities. A large clinical trial, known as TODAY, has been ongoing and will continue for 5 years. In the TODAY study, youth with type 2 diabetes were treated using three different treatment regimens. Now they are being followed every year to learn how their disease progresses and what factors contribute to poor outcomes (TODAY2). When TODAY started, these youth were less than 18 years of age, but now most of them are considered to be ?emerging adults,? in a phase of life during which these young adults must manage many changes, in addition to a serious disease. This study is designed to better understand the challenges and barriers to engaging in healthy behaviors these emerging adults with type 2 diabetes face, especially challenges in taking their medications, and attending healthcare visits. Our specific aims are to develop a full and rich understanding of factors related to medication adherence and healthcare visit attendance, and their relationship to diabetes health outcomes. We will recruit TODAY2 participants (N=350) to take part in this ancillary study at their annual TODAY2 visit. If they agree to participate, they will complete questionnaires (about their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors), participate in unannounced pill counts (to measure their medication adherence), and agree to share other information that is routinely gathered for the TODAY2 study (for example, their blood glucose control levels). They will be assessed two times, one year apart. A subset of them (n=60) will also participate in interviews with trained research staff to describe their experience of living with type 2 diabetes. These data and themes that emerge from the interviews will provide important insights into how they cope and manage their diabetes. By understanding emerging adults with type 2 diabetes better, we will move towards the long term objectives of being able to provide meaningful guidance for the development of interventions that can help them achieve successful diabetes self-management, and for the public policies to support them."
"9462212","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed research is to determine to what extent asthma risk in African American (AA) subjects is modified by environmental exposure risk factors. Recent studies have identified genetic and environmental exposure factors that contribute to asthma risk; however, the extent to which these factors explain a person's risk to asthma remains largely unknown. Our long-term goal is to develop a program of study that would lead to an in-depth understanding of the complex interplay between genetic ancestry and environmental causes of asthma among AA children, and establish the utility of this information to predict and reduce asthma risk in AA children. Despite advances in asthma care, AAs are four times more likely to be hospitalized and seven times more likely to die from asthma than non-AAs. AAs have a mixed parental genome contribution with varying proportion of ancestry from African and European descents. We plan to search for specific genomic regions of unusually high African or European ancestry to identify chromosomal segments that are likely to interact with environmental exposure asthma risk factors. We hypothesize that ancestry and environmental exposure risk factors are critical in asthma risk. Three Specific Aims are proposed to test our hypothesis and achieve our proposed plan: Aim 1) Determine the genetic ancestry and conduct admixture mapping of AA asthmatic children using a multi-ethnic genotyping array; Aim 2) Identify interactions between local ancestry and environmental exposure risk factors in modifying asthma risk; and Aim 3) Replicate the most promising ancestry-specific and A:E interacting 6000 SNPs and develop a genetic ancestry risk score (GARS) to potentially explain a significant portion of asthma risk. To complete these aims we will analyze genetic, environmental exposure factors, clinical and epidemiologic data from the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center pediatric repository cohorts and Cincinnati BioBank. This research will improve our understanding of the interplay between ancestry and environmental exposure factors (traffic, cigarette smoke, mold) that modify asthma risk. Using a unique ancestry-based study design, we are particularly well positioned to develop a roadmap to unravel the relative contributions of genetic and environmental exposure variances and uncover the etiology of asthma in minority children. Predicting the development or progression of asthma is one of the ultimate aims of our research. 1"
"9539747","Project Summary  Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social communication and restricted, repetitive behaviors, interests, or activities. This disorder is frequently comorbid with other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. According to the most recent estimates from the CDC, the prevalence of this disorder is as high as 1 in 68 children and occurs across all socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic groups. This represents a significant clinical, economic, and public health burden. Yet, there are no medications currently available for the treatment of the core symptoms of ASD and its complications. Emerging data implicate dysregulation of dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in conferring susceptibility to ASD and associated neuropsychiatric comorbidities (e.g. anxiety, ADHD). DA neurotransmission is regulated by the dopamine transporter (DAT), which rapidly terminates DA neurotransmission by high-affinity reuptake of released DA into presynaptic terminals. It has been shown that mutations to the human DAT gene (SLC6A3), and specifically a threonine to methionine substitution at position 356 (hDAT T356M), confer risk for ASD and related neuropsychiatric disorders. This de novo mutation has been demonstrated to promote persistent, DAT- mediated reverse transport of DA (here, anomalous dopamine efflux ? ADE). However, it is not yet known whether and how this mutation impacts DA neurotransmission and DA-associated behaviors in mammals. We therefore generated a mouse expressing the DAT T356M variant for use in determining (1) the impact of this mutation on the phenotypic characteristics associated with autism and (2) the dysregulation of DA neurotransmission promoted by ADE in the mammalian brain. We will first explore the impact of this mutation on behaviors known to be regulated, at least in part, by DA neurotransmission and to be altered in individuals with ASD and related disorders (e.g. locomotion, social interactions, repetitive behaviors, anxiety, and changes in interaction with the environment). To determine how the T356M variant affects striatal DA homeostasis and DA dynamics in our newly developed animal model, we will measure DA uptake, DAT surface expression using striatal slice biotinylation, and changes in DA clearance and DA release using ex vivo chronoamperometry and slice amperometry. We will also measure basal extracellular DA using in vivo microdialysis. The proposed studies will provide new insights on how an ASD-associated variant alters DA neurotransmission and how this translates into impairments of specific behaviors. Furthermore, the significance of this proposal is enhanced by the opportunity to define novel molecular mechanisms that confer susceptibility to neuropsychiatric conditions comorbid with ASD, such as ADHD."
"9458076","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While chronic conditions often first present clinically at older ages, their etiology begins much earlier. It is instead during mid-life, and potentially before, that these diseases have their origins. One critical but not well understood environment where most individuals spend the majority of their waking hours during mid-life is the workplace. It is therefore essential that we examine the potential impacts of the work environment on chronic conditions of aging in order to improve health at older ages. Some of the proximal negative health impacts of the workplace have already been documented, but how they may impact health many years later is not well understood. It is also critical that work environment be studied within a broader life course continuum of pre- work environment and post-work environment. Due in part to the absence of data that links the broader environment, work environment and chronic conditions over multiple stages of life, the potential importance of these impacts on health are unclear. My goal for this career development award is to obtain mentoring and training that will allow me to establish myself as an independent researcher focused on understanding the impacts of the workplace on aging and chronic disease. I have developed a project that will build on both my new training and my current expertise in social determinants of health research and epidemiologic methods to examine how the workplace environment, situated within a life course context, impacts aging and chronic disease. I have proposed three areas of focused training and mentoring to be able to accomplish my proposed project and achieve my long term career goals: 1) work and health, 2) aging across the life course and 3) demographic life stage analysis. The specific aims will be achieved using a unique collection of data that has been assembled for approximately 40,000 Alcoa employees. This cohort is the best data for achieving these aims because: 1) there is detailed data on work environment, and substantial variation in work environment across 48 different locations, 2) we are able to fully link working and later life health to early life environment, and 3) we are able o link to complete medical claims records over their entire work history with additional linkage to Medicare records for long-term follow-up. The specific aims are as follows, Aim 1: Quantify the contribution of specific aspects of the workplace environment to aging and chronic disease, Aim 2: Quantify the contributions of early life context, working life context and retirement context to aging and chronic disease, and Aim 3: Use demographic life stage analysis to quantify the future potential impacts of early life context, working life context and retirement context on chronic disease. The expected outcomes of the research component of this career development award are that aims 1 and 2 will identify novel factors associated with aging and chronic disease, and aim 3 will examine the potential role of these factors on future trends in aging and chronic disease."
"9459662","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Building on the experience of successful undergraduate research programs throughout the country including the ten years of implementing REU/SRI undergraduate research programs at the Louis de la Parte Florida Mental Health Institute (FMHI) within the College of Behavioral and Community Sciences at the University of South Florida, we will implement an intensive Summer Research Institute at FMHI (SRI@FMHI). The SRI@FMHI will provide undergraduates with advanced education and mentoring in substance use disorders (SUDs) research to encourage their trajectory to matriculate to graduate school in behavioral health, and to enhance the pool of researchers in the SUDs area who achieve successful support from NIH/NIDA and other federal and national research institutions. The undergraduate program will consist of four components: (1) intensive research experience, (2) research seminars, (3) professional development seminars, and (4) skill building workshops. The objectives of the SRI@FMHI are as follows: (1) increase student knowledge in the area of SUDs research, research processes, research ethics, and the responsible conduct of research by providing an eleven week multi- disciplinary summer research education program for 60 undergraduate students (cohorts of 12 students for each of five consecutive years during the grant period); (2) increase student proficiency in SUDs research by immersing them in research laboratory and field experiences, and guiding their work on an independent research project conducted in collaboration with faculty mentors; (3) augment the number of undergraduate students who enroll in SUD/behavioral health graduate programs and pursue research careers related to SUDs; and (4) increase the pool of trained junior scientists in the area of SUDs from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds, through targeted recruitment strategies that have been refined in the past ten years of our REU/SRI programs. In order to accomplish these objectives, the SRI@FMHI will build on the experience of successful undergraduate research programs throughout the country including our own REU/SRI programs. The SRI will be based on the principle that the best way for students to learn about research is to be actively engaged with a faculty mentor in conducting research. Reasoning, critical thinking, and research skills improve more when students actively participate in research than when they engage in the passive instruction that characterizes most statistics and research methods courses. Nine primary techniques will be employed to facilitate active learning in the SRI@FMHI program: (1) experiential learning, (2) independent projects with support from a faculty mentor, (3) cooperative learning, (4) student presentations, (5) group projects, (6) peer review, (7) student-selected topics, (8) group discussions, and (9) student-developed activities. Problem-Based Learning (PBL) incorporates many of these techniques, and PBL will be used within the SRI@FMHI to engage student research teams in finding solutions to real world problems."
"9457154","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The use of simple vertebrate models to identify the molecular and cellular basis of neuromuscular regulation of bone represents a powerful yet unexplored strategy to uncover homologous pathways in higher organisms. In this context, in vivo screens and rapid gene knockdown strategies hold unique potential to identify extraskeletal pathways regulating osteogenesis, however such strategies are largely inaccessible in traditional in vivo models of bone anabolism. Toward overcoming this hurdle, in this project we will develop the regenerating zebrafish tail fin, a model of intramembranous ossification that recapitulates the major phases of mammalian bone formation, as a rapid genetic platform for neuroskeletal pathway discovery. In particular, our central objective is to integrate quantitative bone imaging in the regenerating fin with zebrafish knockdown and screening strategies to identify novel neural regulators of bone outgrowth, patterning, and mineralization. If successful, these studies will establish powerful in vivo assays for neuroskeletal pathway assessment in the regenerating fin, develop the technological toolbox for measuring bone growth and mineralization in this process, and identify valuable chemical entry points for neuroskeletal discovery. In doing so, this project will advance the regenerating zebrafish fin as a novel in vivo model for the emerging field of neuroskeletal systems biology, and catalyze broader pathway and therapeutic screening efforts in the zebrafish skeleton. This research will be carried out under the mentorship of a highly collaborative advisory committee (whose collective achievements include seminal findings in regenerative biology, zebrafish skeletal development, neuroskeletal biology, and evolutionary genomics), providing a rich, multidisciplinary research experience. By providing the PI technical training, expert guidance, and career mentorship as he transitions to a new research field, this project will directly facilitate his progression to research independence."
"9462717","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, established in 1984, proposes to continue and expand its research into the underpinnings of Alzheimer's and related dementias with 5 major goals. First, we will focus on the earliest stages of the disease process, when symptoms and signs are subtle, or even undetectable, by bringing to bear an integrated multidisciplinary team of clinicians and scientists. Second, we will continue to provide critical infrastructure and resources to support Alzheimer disease and dementia related research across a range of institutions including Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and the Harvard School of Public Health as well as supporting national initiatives. Third, we will innovate with technical developmental projects in each Core, targeting the boundaries of cognitive ageing and disease. Fourth, we are committed to mentoring, educating, and developing future leaders through formal training or mentoring programs in each Core. Fifth, we continue to reach out to the surrounding community in order to communicate the urgency of understanding this devastating disease, and to enhance recruitment of a diverse pool of subjects and patients for critical studies. These broad aims are distributed among the mandated Administration, Clinical, Data Management and Statistics, Neuropathology and Outreach Cores, along with a new Neuroimaging Core. Each Core provides support for, and helps catalyze, the MADRC's mission, including active participation in national programs (e.g. NACC, ADNI, ADCS, ADGC, DIAN), more than 40 local clinical initiatives, and pilot projects. Three small R01 style projects leverage these Cores and are designed to marry cutting edge science with the clinical programs. Project 1, led by a new junior investigator, Dr Hedden, uses state-of-the art fMRI and Connectome techniques (a new technology that illuminates white matter pathways) as well as quantitative structural MRI approaches to study the neural system basis of the earliest cognitive impairments. Project 2, led by Dr Gomez-Isla (a senior investigator recruited to our Center in the current grant period) combines resources with 5 other ADCs to define the neuropathological phenotype of individuals who are amyloid imaging-positive and cognitively normal. Project 3, led by Dr Hyman, explores a new transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer disease that develops tangles in entorhinal cortex and widespread plaques and compares it to human neuropathological samples - to examine experimentally the neural system biology of this early point in the disease process. Together these efforts are aimed at targeting early disease phenotypes - as national efforts towards early intervention and prevention strategies unfold. Along with parallel ongoing multidisciplinary studies of established dementias, we believe the MADRC has made, and is well positioned to continue to make, strong contributions to Alzheimer research."
"9477939","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The spleen is required for the generation of systemic tolerance to apoptotic cells. We have recently shown a specialized set of macrophages residing in the marginal zone region of the red pulp drive immunologic tolerance to apoptotic material and in their absence apoptotic cells induce inflammation and autoimmune reactivity. While it is not known how this occurs on a mechanistic level, we have found apoptotic cells provoke expression of a tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme, indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase (IDO), which is critical for immune suppression in a variety of inflammatory settings. Further we discovered blockade of IDO greatly altered the way macrophages and dendritic cells respond to apoptotic cells with increased inflammatory immunity and autoimmune disease activity in lupus-prone animals. Thus the data suggest a novel mechanism whereby IDO activity in macrophages controls both innate and adaptive immunity to apoptotic cells. Our proposed project will examine how apoptotic cells driven IDO activity impacts mTOR signals in marginal zone macrophages, how IDO-driven tryptophan metabolism impacts apoptotic cell-mediated tolerance, and mechanisms by which IDO may influence Treg activation; finally testing these mechanisms in an experimental model of systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, the findings of this project could have enormous implications in diseases of hypo and hyper-immunity where modulation of the tolerogenic rheostat would provide significant clinical benefit."
"9471226","Project Summary Stroke survivors and spousal caregivers face significant challenges, yet interventions to support couples after stroke are largely lacking. Depressive symptoms post-stroke occur in 30-50% of survivors and partner caregivers, and have significant consequences on function and quality of life. Further, mood and psychosocial well-being are reciprocal in couples, meaning if one partner is depressed, the other is more likely to be depressed. Sustaining well-being in both partners is important for continued engagement in rehabilitation and re-integration into the community, yet existing interventions are aimed at the individual rather than the couple. This study will address this gap by testing an innovative dyadic (couples-based) intervention using a new approach based on positive psychology that focuses on the strengths in the relationship in order to foster resilience in the couple. Using a randomized waitlist control design, this pilot study aims to determine whether an 8-week dyadic positive psychology-based intervention (PPI) can improve mood and subjective well-being as assessed by established outcome measures in 24 couples coping with stroke. The intervention consists of self- administered PPI activities, such as expressing gratitude and practicing acts of kindness, which participants complete individually and as a couple. Two potential pathways will be explored for the PPI: (a) enhanced quality of interactions as couples deal with daily life demands and (b) improvements in mood that are ?contagious? among couples. If found effective, couples with greater well-being may be better emotionally equipped to cope with the sequelae of stroke by reducing stress and depressive symptoms, and increasing participation in meaningful activities and quality of life."
"9451995","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is among the most significant and preventable risk factors for developing osteoarthritis (OA). Efforts to identify the causes of this risk have traditionally focused on obesity-induced triggers of joint stress, such as mechanical and inflammatory factors. However, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding about how obesity impairs chondrocyte cellular defense mechanisms resulting in inappropriate or insufficient responses to joint stresses. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop strategies t either up-regulate chondroprotective pathways or down-regulate cell catabolic pathways that become dysregulated with obesity and aging. The objective here is to determine how obesity increases the acetylation of mitochondrial proteins that ultimately regulate cartilage catabolism under aging and inflammatory conditions. This focus is derived from the applicant's exciting preliminary data linking an age-related decline in the regulation of mitochondrial protein acetylation by the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 to impaired antioxidant defense and OA. The central hypothesis is that obesity exacerbates an age-related increase in chronic mitochondrial hyper-acetylation resulting in chondrocyte redox stress and cartilage catabolism. It is proposed that this imbalance is driven by an aging-dependent decline in SIRT3 expression coupled with an obesity-driven increase in acetyl-CoA production and inflammation. Preliminary data show that the mitochondrial antioxidant, SOD2, is a key target of hyper-acetylation in chondrocytes. Guided by these and additional preliminary data, the hypothesis will be tested by three specific aims: 1) Determine how obesity induces metabolic changes that promote mitochondrial protein acetylation; 2) Determine the aging and obesity-dependent effects of manipulating SIRT3 expression, positively or negatively, on chondrocyte redox homeostasis and cartilage catabolism; and 3) Identify the mechanisms by which SIRT3 regulates mitochondrial redox homeostasis and activation of cartilage catabolic pathways following a pro-inflammatory challenge. Well-established mouse models of diet-induced obesity and OA will be used in combination with genetically modified mice that allow for the conditional deletion or over- expression of SIRT3 in cartilage. Targeted genomic, proteomic, and metabolite detection methods are in place for aims 1 and 2 to determine the factors that promote mitochondrial acetylation, alter antioxidant capacity, and induce OA. Aim 3 will use ex vivo interleukin-1 stimulation assays to identify SIRT3-sensitive cartilage catabolic pathways. Mice with cartilage-specific deletion of SOD2 will provide a reference for evaluating the effect of SOD2 hyper-acetylation on chondrocyte oxidative stress and activation of downstream catabolic pathways. This approach is innovative because it shifts the focus of obesity research on OA from cellular stress triggers to stress susceptibility. The proposed research is significant because it will initiate the systematic study of how reversible post-translational lysine acetylation of mitochondrial proteins may be manipulated, either positively or negatively, to promote chondroprotection with aging and obesity."
"9459739","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complement system is a major component of innate immunity and plays a central role in the pro-inflammatory mechanisms that drive the pathogenesis of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this process, inappropriate complement activation that is directed to self-tissues drives cellular influx, synovial inflammation and bone erosions. Recent findings suggest that this pathogenic process is likely to be especially important in the early phases of disease when circulating autoantibodies initially react with antigens which develop and are displayed in the joint. We have used an animal model of RA designated collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) to understand the molecular basis for these injurious roles of complement. One major focus of the proposed studies will be on how complement is activated within the joint by injured tissues through the engagement of the lectin pathway, which we recently unexpectedly found to play a major role in CAIA. Once activated, the lectin pathway leads to pathogenic engagement of the alternative pathway amplification loop. We will also determine whether factor H (FH), a soluble protein that we have shown plays an essential role in controlling complement activation on the acellular cartilage and stressed fibroblast-like synovial (FLS) cells, is itself the target of de-regulatory proteins from the facor H related (FHR) protein family which modulate its function. Finally, we have made the surprising finding that distal complement effector pathways initiated by anaphylatoxin C5a and C3a receptor engagement amplifies anti-collagen antibody deposition and proximal complement C3 activation, resulting in greatly increased joint damage. We intend to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which this distal amplification process occurs and determine what effector cells and danger signals mediate this effect. As a major focus of this effort, we have identified and wil explore a new injury mechanism through the engagement of hard-wired pathogenic natural antibodies that recognize injury- associated neoepitopes as danger signals and further increase complement activation. Through these efforts we hope to identify novel means by which we can beneficially modulate complement in a therapeutically efficacious manner."
"9423791","Perturbations in sodium homeostasis are, unarguably, a central pathophysiologic lesion in heart failure (HF). Unfortunately, attempts to prevent or treat volume overload with salt restriction can further worsen the sodium avid state. Recent literature, spanning experimental to epidemiologic, has highlighted the double edged sword of salt restriction, finding that neurohormonal activation, volume status and even outcomes can sometimes improve with higher salt intake. While it is clear that sodium drives volume overload, a significant body of literature has confirmed renal salt sensing relies on chloride rather than sodium. It has been known for decades that renal responses such as tubuloglomerular feedback and renin release are governed by chloride. Recently, a family of serine-threonine kinases (With-No-Lysine (K), WNK) have been identified as the molecular sensor for chloride and master regulator of sodium transporters in the kidney. The above observations led us to hypothesize that chloride may be an important target in HF and over a series of 7 manuscripts we have demonstrated that chloride, rather than sodium, is primarily associated with diuretic resistance, neurohormonal activation and mortality in HF. Moreover, in a pilot study we demonstrated that administration of three days of 115 mmol/day of sodium-free chloride (as lysine chloride) caused a substantial downregulation in renal sodium transporters and multiple signals supporting improvement in volume status.  The overarching goal of the current proposal is to address the fundamental gaps in our understanding of chloride homeostasis in HF, facilitating the translation of a large body of promising experimental and observational literature into a potentially viable therapeutic approach in HF. To achieve this goal, we propose a classic and rigorous placebo controlled crossover inpatient ?GCRC? balance study (n=20 participants), a placebo controlled ?real world? efficacy study in decompensated HF patients receiving aggressive IV diuretics (n=100 patients) and innovative interrogation of renal structural (quantitation of renal tubular solute transporters using urinary exosomes) and functional changes (using lithium clearance, the ?gold standard? technique to query in vivo proximal tubular sodium handling). Our aims are to 1) To understand the quantitative effects of sodium free chloride supplementation on electrolyte balance, volume status, and sodium avidity in stable HF patients in a highly controlled inpatient environment. 2) To determine if sodium free chloride supplementation will improve volume status in the real world setting of decompensated HF treated with aggressive use of IV loop diuretics. 3) To determine if sodium free chloride supplementation induces an intra-renal pattern of change consistent with suppression of WNK including deactivation of downstream kinases, reduction of the quantity of WNK regulated sodium cotransporters, and a redistribution of intra-renal sodium reabsorption."
"9502834","This application is for a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) entitled ?Degradation of The Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) by FBXO10 ? A Novel Mechanism in Lung Epithelial Cell Injury?. I am a physician in pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. I am applying for this award to acquire advanced training in molecular physiology and cell biology, as well as new training in translational research methods and regulatory science, to develop my career as a physician scientist focused on the study of Acute Lung Injury. The main objective of my proposal is to determine how a novel RAGE degradation pathway in lung epithelial cells modulates severe lung injury. RAGE is a cell membrane receptor enriched in lung epithelia, and contributes to epithelial cell injury by weakening attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and amplifying inflammatory signals in response to circulating ligands encountered in excessive inflammatory conditions such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Our preliminary data indicate that RAGE is degraded in lung epithelial cells in a mechanism dependent on the post-translational modification of ubiquitination. Furthermore, we have preliminarily identified a novel ubiquitin-transferring subunit termed FBXO10 responsible for targeting RAGE for degradation, and also show that RAGE is degraded in response to a ligand elevated in ARDS, CpG DNA. The aims of this study are: 1.) To determine if RAGE is ubiquitinated and degraded in lung epithelial cells by the E3-Ligase subunit FBXO10, and 2.) To determine the mechanism and biologic effect of RAGE degradation in pulmonary epithelial cells. These studies will provide insight into a novel pathologic model whereby RAGE degradation, regulated by FBXO10 mediated protein ubiquitination, controls epithelial cell detachment and excessive inflammation. FBXO10 mediated ubiquitination and degradation of RAGE may contribute to the histopathologic phenotype of ?diffuse alveolar damage? characteristic of ARDS by promoting epithelial cell detachment from the ECM. Thus, modulating RAGE degradation may be a novel strategy to render epithelial cells more resistant to injury and contribute to an unmet need in novel ARDS therapies. This project will provide me advanced skills in molecular physiology and cell biology, and I will be trained in translational research methodologies and regulatory science to strengthen my development into an independent investigator. My work will be completed within the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, which is dedicated to the development of physician scientists. I have committed mentoring from our Division Chief Dr. Rama Mallampalli as well as a PhD cosponsor in Dr. Bill Chen. Additionally, my mentoring committee includes Dr. Janet Lee, MD ? an expert in innate immunity and host defense, and Dr. Bryan McVerry ? a translational scientist and member of the Acute Lung Injury Center of Excellence in charge of the clinical ALI program."
"9482764","PROJECT SUMMARY Many cognitive and affective functions are preserved during aging and it has been suggested that older people are better at regulating negative emotions. Previous studies have elucidated regional brain activations in response to social emotional stimuli. However, the neural circuits regulating physiological responses to social emotions and how these processes differ between young and old people have not been explored.  Emotion is represented in complex interactions between frontal limbic areas and subcortical circuits that embody physiological reactions. Emotional, compared to non-emotional, stimuli elicit robust autonomic responses congruent with interoceptive perception. Negative emotions are associated with decreased heart rate variability (HRV) and increased skin conductance level (SCL); in contrast, positive emotions are associated with increased HRV and decreased SCL. On the other hand, less is known about how cerebral activations to emotional stimuli in a social context are related to autonomic responses. No studies have examined the causal relationship between cerebral activities and autonomic responses to social emotional stimulation or the effects of aging on these regulatory activities. This R21 application aims to address these gaps of research.  We will assess and recruit young and old adults to participate in brain imaging while exposed to social emotions. We will examine (a) whether and how social, compared to neutral, emotion scenarios, evoke changes in HRV and SCL, and how these changes vary between young and old individuals; and (b) how regional responses to social emotions correlate with and Granger cause HRV and SCL, building on our work of Granger causality analysis, and how these regulatory activities vary between young and old individuals. We will also explore how autonomic responses, regional activations to social emotional stimulation and their regulation of autonomic responses relate to social anxiety as well as age and gender effects on the relations.  Together, the study will elucidate cerebral responses to social emotions, how regional and circuit activities regulate physiological responses to social emotions, and the influence of aging on these neural regulatory activities. The potential findings may advance our knowledge of the effects of aging on emotional experience and move aging and affective neuroscience research in new directions."
"9459298","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly three quarters of women develop hot flashes during the menopausal transition, and up to a third report hot flashes that persist for more than a decade after menopause. While estrogen therapy is effective in suppressing hot flashes, it is associated with increased risk of endometrial cancer, and when combined with a progestin to prevent endometrial hyperplasia, it also increases risk of coronary disease, thromboembolic events, and breast cancer, particularly in women who are 5 or more years past menopause. As a result, there is widespread interest in identifying non-hormonal treatments for hot flashes that are both effective and safe. While prior efforts to identify non-hormonal treatments have focused on possible central triggering mechanisms, the final pathway underlying the physical manifestation of the hot flash is peripheral vasodilation. Clinical studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in mediating vasodilation during hot flashes, with local cutaneous blockade of NO synthase suppressing hot flashes. One pharmacologic agent with direct and potent effects on NO-mediated vasodilation is nitroglycerin (NTG), an organic nitrate that is widely used to treat chest pain in patients with coronary disease. Initial use of NTG increases production of NO, promotes vascular smooth muscle relaxation, and triggers vasodilation; however, continued use of NTG rapidly leads to tolerance to both exogenous and endogenous nitrates, due to enhanced NO degradation. This tolerance offers a potentially innovative approach to treating hot flashes, as women who develop tolerance should experience a marked reduction in hot flash-related vasodilation. To explore the possibility of using NTG to treat menopausal hot flashes, our research team conducted a pilot trial of escalating-dose, uninterrupted transdermal NTG in 19 peri- and postmenopausal women with 7 or more hot flashes per day. All women were started on a generic 0.1 mg/hr NTG patch (applied daily without patch- free periods) and underwent dose escalation on a weekly basis to 0.4 or 0.6 mg/hr as tolerated. Over 4 weeks, the average frequency of hot flashes decreased by 54% and the average frequency of moderate-to-severe hot flashes decreased by 69% from baseline to maximum-dose therapy (P<0.01 for both). Women also demonstrated a 33% to 68% improvement in scores on insomnia, depression, and quality-of-life measures. To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of this novel treatment strategy, we now propose to conduct a rigorous, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 140 peri- or postmenopausal women. Women who document frequent hot flashes and who do not have coronary disease or contraindications to NTG therapy will be randomly assigned to uninterrupted use of transdermal NTG or identical-appearing placebo patches for 24 weeks. By providing the first rigorous evidence of the efficacy and safety of NTG for hot flashes, this research may help decrease the burden of the most common symptomatic complaint of menopausal women."
"9610803","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional (2D) tissue culture models are highly simplified cancer models unable to capture the complexity and heterogeneity found in-vivo. Around 95% of new anticancer drugs eventually fail in clinical trial despite robust indications of activity in existing in vitro pre-clinical models, making in vitro testing some of the least predictive. Three dimensional (3D) spheroid culture models have recently advanced to bridge the ?in- vitro to in-vivo gap? and provide the means for assembling more complex cancer relevant tissue microenvironments. Although these 3D models are being adopted by industry and the academic community, they have limitations and are hampered by low throughput, lack of consistency, high costs and the need for clinical validation. The Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center (SRIMSC) in partnership with n3D Biosciences Inc., Greiner Bio-One USA Inc., Dr. Derek Duckett at Scripps Research department of Molecular Therapeutics and Dr. David Tuveson, M.D, Ph.D. at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), have created a strategic collaboration to advance a novel technology known as 3D magnetic bioprinting. Magnetic 3D bioprinting addresses the these critical issues by utilizing n3D's core technology known as the NanoShuttle to levitate and aggregate cells using magnetic forces to produce spheroids/organoids. The ultimate end product will be an affordable; HTS validated 384 and 1536 microplate format that supports rapid/consistent production of 3D spheroids for a wide array of cell types including primary tumor lines. The end goal is to accelerate 3D spheroid cultivation using screening automation, improve cost efficiency and allow for rapid drug testing such as FDA approved drugs in reformulation/repurposing studies. Advancement of this technology will be facilitated through the following: Aim 1: Validation of the current 384 well plate nanosphere technology in a HTS facility for automation compatibility. Compare 3D results to 2D models of KRAS pancreatic cancer cell models as provided by Dr. Tuveson. Aim 2: Validation of n3D spheroid technology for drug testing against select cytotoxic drugs, NCI approved oncology drug set and the Scripps FDA Approved drug collection. CC50 data, i.e. the concentration that produces 50% cellular cytotoxicity, in 2D and in 3D formats will be compared to published literature. Aim 3: n3D Biosciences will produce an advance 1536 well plate NanoShuttle driver compatible for HTS and drug discovery efforts. SRIMSC will evaluate and implement the higher density format for drug discovery utility which will culminate in its testing on a large library of ~150K compounds to demonstrate HTS readiness. Aim 4: The n3D spheroid technology will be employed against patient derived primary Glioblastoma Multiform (GBM) derived cells with the end goal of evaluating its utility in primary cancer cell research. Aim 5: The n3D spheroid technology will be evaluated in-vivo for pancreatic orthotopic tumor effect and its utility in preclinical research. The end goal is to transfer and implement this technology and methods worldwide for cancer research and early drug discovery."
"9326110","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial is to demonstrate that stellate ganglion block (SGB) is an effective and safe non-hormonal intervention for women seeking relief from vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and to identify the physiologic mechanisms underlying this treatment effect. More than 50% of women experience frequent hot flashes and night sweats (i.e., VMS), and these symptoms last on average 7.4 years. VMS are associated with decreased quality of life, increased depressive and anxiety symptoms, sleep disturbance, memory difficulties, and reduced productivity. Safety concerns raised in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) led to an 80% decline in the use of hormone therapy in the United States. Identifying safe and effective non-hormonal treatments for VMS remains a priority in women's health research. The stellate ganglion, a sympathetic neural structure in the deep tissues of the neck, is commonly blocked with local anesthetics in the treatment of neuropathic and vascular disorders. In open-label intervention studies SGB with local anesthetic reduced VMS by 34 to 90% four weeks to several months after treatment. We conducted the first randomized, sham-controlled (injection of saline into subcutaneous tissue in the neck) trial of SGB (with 0.5% bupivacaine 5 mL) for the treatment of VMS in menopausal women with moderate to very severe VMS (n = 40). A single SGB with local anesthetic significantly reduced moderate-to-very severe VMS by 50% more than sham treatment and lasted for up to sixth months. Analyses of secondary outcomes revealed significant improvements in objectively-measured VMS and trends (p < .10) for improvements in depressive symptoms and memory performance with active SGB compared to sham intervention. In this proposal, we aim to conduct a randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial to more definitively assess the effects of SGB on VMS and to conduct foundational studies to identify the mechanisms of SGB action. The clinical trial will include 220 menopausal women who report 28 or more weekly VMS. Secondary outcomes will include objectively- measured VMS, mood and anxiety, quality of life, sleep, and memory performance. After an initial baseline assessment, women will be reassessed at 3 and 6 months following the SGB or sham intervention. In a subset of 60 women (30 per arm), we will perform a nested, mechanistic substudy built on foundational work in neuroimaging of VMS and ambulatory monitoring of sympathetic nerve activity and telemetry. These two mechanistic outcomes will be obtained at baseline and at 3 months following the intervention. We predict that compared to sham intervention, SGB will reduce the frequency of VMS, improve mood and anxiety, increase quality of life, and improve memory, reduce efferent sympathetic nerve activity and normalize brain activity in thermoregulatory brain areas but have no effect on sleep or other cognitive functions. By providing a more definitive understanding of the effectiveness of SGB, possible secondary benefits, and mechanisms of action, these findings will fill a critical gap in treatment options available to women."
"9574005","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adults in the United States today are consuming ~500 kcal per day more compared to adults in 1980, a phenomenon underlying the fact that obesity prevalence in the U.S. has increased by 75% in the past 30 years. Both the size of an individual meal and the frequency of meal or snack initiation are heavily influenced by previous experience and by exposure to external food-associated stimuli (e.g., visual, olfactory) that can override biological satiation and satiety cues. Therefore, the development of effective pharmacological treatments for obesity requires a better understanding of the neurobiological systems that integrate previous experience with external and internal cues to control food intake. Novel pilot data presented in this proposal implicate the hippocampal formation (HPF), particularly its ventral subregion (HPFv), in this type of higher-order regulation of feeding behavior. HPFv neurons influence food intake, in part, by processing neuroendocrine signals that inform about energy status. Meal size, meal frequency, and overall food intake are increased when receptors for the gut-derived hormone ghrelin (GHS-1RA) are activated on HPFv neurons. On the other hand, average meal size and overall food intake are potently reduced following activation of HPFv receptors for GLP-1, a GI- and hindbrain-secreted satiation peptide. In addition to neuroendocrine signals, HPF neurons receive gastrointestinal (GI) visceral information from ascending vagus nerve-hindbrain neural pathways. Our pilot data show that HPFv neurons are activated by peripheral cholecystokinin (CCK), a satiation peptide that reduces meal size via vagus nerve signaling. Other pilot data show that subdiaphragmatic vagotomy impairs HPF-dependent spatial working memory. Collectively, these novel findings indicate that HPF neurons are impacted by various physiological cues that inform about energy status. Experiments will expand these findings using behavioral, neuroanatomical, genetic (RNA-interference), surgical, and other methodologies to determine whether, [Aim I] endogenous HPFv GHS-R1A or GLP-1R signaling increases or decreases (respectively) meal size, meal frequency, and overall energy balance, and [Aim II] whether ablated GI vagus afferent signaling negatively impacts HPF-dependent appetitive learning processes related to food procurement. Additional experiments [Aim III] utilize neuroanatomical analyses to characterize the bi- directional, multisynaptic communication between HPFv and hindbrain neurons. The functional relevance of these neural pathways to feeding behavior will be tested using newly-developed techniques for monosynaptic neural inhibition (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs). Overall our approach utilizes multiple levels of analysis to explore our hypothesis that the HPF is a critical neural locus for integrating previous experience with external food cues and internal visceral cues to control higher-order aspects of feeding. Results from proposed experiments have strong potential to deepen understanding of the neurochemical and neuroanatomical systems controlling excessive feeding behavior."
"9465228","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 repeat that results in expression of the DUX4 retrogene. Mutations in SMCHD1 result in decreased D4Z4 epigenetic repression through its direct repressor activity at the D4Z4 repeat and cause FSHD. The broad and long-term goal of this application is to develop therapies for FSHD based on increasing SMCHD1 activity or protein level, or decreasing the activity of factor(s) that counter-act SMCHD1 epigenetic activity at the D4Z4 repeats. The specific goal of the research design is to determine the positive and negative modulators of SMCHD1 activity and their epistatic relationship to the epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat and DUX4 expression. Aim 1 will identify the molecular components and the biological functions of the pathways that regulate the post-transcriptional and post-translational production and activity of SMCHD1, and provide a rational basis for the therapeutic modulation of SMCHD1 in FSHD muscle. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that FSHD2-associated SMCHD1 variants partially inhibit the activity or stability of the wild-type protein and provide a rationale to target the variant isoforms as a therapeutic approach. Aim 3 Identifies components of the SMCHD1 repressive complex and determines their role in D4Z4 epigenetic repression. Together, these studies will provide the basis for future therapeutic development based on increasing the epigenetic repression of D4Z4 in FSHD individuals."
"9520126","PROJECT 5: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) with persulfate (S2O82-) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are being employed increasingly for hazardous waste site remediation due its potential to quickly and inexpensively remediate recalcitrant Superfund contaminants. Similarly, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and electrochemical treatment technologies are promising alternatives to physical treatment processes for the ex situ treatment of waters containing low concentrations of contaminants. Although these techniques are being employed for site remediation, the mechanisms through which contaminants are degraded are not well understood. In particular, available evidence suggests that oxidation of contaminants may result in the formation of toxic transformation products. The overall goal of this research project is to assess the formation, fate and toxicity of transformation products produced by oxidative remediation with existing ISCO approaches and emerging remediation technologies, such as electrochemical treatment, and develop approaches for reducing potential exposure to oxidative transformation products. Through rigorous research on reaction mechanisms, contaminant fate and toxicity we will provide engineers with the ability to predict when oxidative treatment will be effective and to determine under which conditions potentially toxic transformation products will be formed. The latter may lead to the development of additional treatment steps that could be used in concert with oxidative remediation technologies. We will focus our efforts on the identification of oxidative transformation products of substituted aromatic compounds, including amino-, chloro-, nitro- and alkyl-benzenes. This knowledge will be used to identify reaction mechanisms and predict the reaction mechanisms of structurally similar compounds. To assess the stability of transformation products, we will conduct laboratory experiments with groundwater and aquifer sediments to determine if transformation products can be degraded further by microorganisms or by reactions with minerals or natural organic matter. To determine the potential health effects arising from the exposure to transformation products, we will use state-of-the-art bioanalytical strategies that allow for the determination of the interactions of reactive transformation products with biomolecules at the molecular level. This framework will substantially increase our understanding of mechanisms that lead to the removal of contaminants and formation of stable transformation products during oxidative treatment. It will also allow us to better predict under which conditions oxidative treatment technologies are appropriate and steps that can be taken to advance their adoption in situations where the production of toxic transformation products is possible."
"9598989","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The overriding objective of this R21 application is to develop a new innovative paradigm and address a new approach to nonhuman primate models of human congenital diseases using breakthrough technologies in genetic engineering. Mice have evolved as a premiere model for human genetics largely because of the ability to manipulate their genome with gene targeting, which has enabled substantial contributions to the understanding of genetics and disease. With the advent of more advanced methods for gene editing, including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9), it is now possible to modify the genetics of other species that are more similar to humans. However, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in the nonhuman primate germline is very inefficient and laborious, and it is unclear that such methods will find widespread use for providing improved models of human disease. The objective of these studies is to capitalize on our innovative capabilities for in vivo delivery of gene editing tools in rhesus monkeys. The Specific Aims for these studies will: (1) Benchmark knock-out frequencies, and (2) Benchmark knock-in frequencies in the developing brains of early gestation fetal rhesus monkeys. The outcome of these studies will demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for the future production of translational models of human congenital diseases that will be predictive for modeling patient-derived mutations and assessing new therapeutics for human use."
"9463338","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Candidate for this K01 award, Dr. Liang Liu, joined the Department of Dermatology at Columbia University in July, 2010 as an Associate Research Scientist, where he studies epigenetic regulation of epidermal development and homeostasis under the direction of Dr. Angela Christiano, the Mentor of this K01 award. Dr. Liu's research interest centers on elucidating how genes and environment interact to influence development and disease susceptibility. The major goal of this project is to define the genetic and epigenetic pathways by which HR regulates epidermal growth and proliferation in skin homeostasis. Dr. Liu is committed to a biomedical research career. During the first two years of the award, he will focus on building up his research publication record and improving his skills in scientific writing including research articles and grant applications. From the third year of this K01 award, Dr. Liu will actively seek long-term funding support that will allow him to become a fully independent investigator after completion of this K01 award. Dr. Liu's long term career goal is to establish an innovative and independent research program in cutaneous biology. Institutional Environment Columbia University is one of the top research institutions in the US and has outstanding resources for trainees. There are state of the art laboratories for work in basic and clinical research and outstanding core facilities for supporting molecular and clinical research activities. The candidate's more immediate research environment is the Department of Dermatology and the Columbia University Skin Disease Research Center. He is also a member of the NIEHS Center for Environmental Health in Northern Manhattan, which provides additional resources and infrastructure that will facilitate the completion of this project. Research Summary Hairless (HR) belongs to the Jumonji C family of proteins, many of which function as histone demethylases (HDM) that participate in gene regulation via epigenetic mechanisms. We previously reported that mutations in HR are deleterious for skin homeostasis and hair follicle cycling, as exemplified by the clinical manifestations of patients with alopecia with papular lesions. We now have compelling evidence showing that HR is a HDM, regulating a subset of target genes through histone demethylation. We hypothesize that hairless acts as an epigenetic regulator of skin homeostasis via its downstream target genes to control cell proliferation and apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we will focus on studying the role of hairless and its downstream target genes and pathways in epidermal growth and differentiation. We will employ molecular biological methods such as gene expression profiling, ChIP-Seq analysis, and comprehensive functional assays to rigorously test our hypothesis. Findings from this project will significantly enhance our understandings of the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of skin disorders such as hyperplasia and photoaging. The Candidate anticipates being able to complete the studies within a five-year award period through collaborative efforts with his Mentors and collaborators."
"9637765","PROJECT SUMMARY: Despite the intensive effort and huge progress in cancer research, survival rate of many cancers remains low and one of the biggest challenges is resistance to anti-cancer targeted therapies. Recently, a novel mechanism of resistance has been recognized: by switching lineages from a cell type that is dependent on the drug target to a different cell type that is not. My previous and ongoing work revealed that advanced prostate cancer might escape antiandrogen therapy by increasing cellular lineage plasticity and transdifferentiate into a progenitor-like transition state which no longer responds to treatment. I have further demonstrated that this lineage plasticity is enabled by reactivation of SOX2, and can be reversed by inhibiting SOX2 expression. Although direct therapeutic inhibition of SOX2 is currently infeasible, clinical interruption of SOX2 upregulation and its downstream signaling is very promising, upon a clear elucidation of the mechanism of SOX2-driven plasticity. Furthermore, my preliminary observation shows that epigenetic modification may contribute to this SOX2-driven plasticity and resistance, which suggests novel therapeutic approaches targeting the epigenetic modifying machinery. Building on these findings, the proposed studies in Aim 1 and 2 focus on elucidating the exact mechanism of increasing plasticity and resistance driven by SOX2 in prostate cancer, possibly through epigenetic modification, and developing novel strategies to prevent it. In an effort to identify additional genomic alterations responsible for resistance, I successfully identified a novel tumor suppressor gene, SYNCRIP, that confer resistance to antiandrogen therapy via in vivo library screening. Because of the known interaction between SYNCRIP and deaminase Apobec-1, I will also test the hypothesis that loss of SYNCRIP in prostate cancer may confer resistance by releasing the inhibition of Apobec-1-driven methylation/demethylation, thus leading to increased epigenetic reprogramming and cell plasticity in Aim 3. The potential outcome of proposed studies will provide novel insight into the connection between epigenetic modification and resistance to targeted therapy in advanced prostate cancer, as well as novel approaches for clinical intervention of resistance. The support of the K99/R00 award for these proposed studies will provide me the protected time and required training in the fields of cancer epigenetics, chromatin biology and bioinformatics, as well as serve as a platform for me to obtain career development trainings such as grant writing, job application, manuscript writing and lab management. I believe all these supports and trainings are critical for achieving my career goal to become an independent investigator studying targeted therapy resistance."
"9559575","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a devastating autoimmune disease that destroys islet-cell insulin production. Millions of Americans, especially children, are affected and must rely on lifelong insulin administration and struggle with life-threatening co-morbidities. Most new cases of T1D are diagnosed in emergency settings with presentation in potentially deadly diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Current pre-clinical diagnostic tests that can permit preventive action for T1D are slow and not readily available outside of tertiary care centers. In this proposal Enable Biosciences will further develop and validate a novel low-cost and high-throughput immunoassay to rapidly and sensitively screen for the four cardinal autoantibody markers that predict risk for type 1 diabetes. Such a test could supplant the current expensive, slow radioactive method. By reducing costs while retaining sensitivity and specificity with a robust very low-sample volume assay, Enable Biosciences' product will permit increased testing to reveal incipient T1D in the general population at the optimal time for intervention. During the Phase I funding period, Enable prototyped a 3-member T1D autoantibody panel using their core Antibody Detection by Agglutination-PCR (ADAP) technology and demonstrated substantial equivalence with the gold-standard assay while removing reliance on radioactive reagents. In this Phase 2 proposal, Enable presents a comprehensive plan to enhance this panel via automation using a dedicated robotic liquid handling system, greatly increasing assay throughput and reliability while further reducing costs. We will also adapt our assay chemistry to be able to use Taqman probes. This will result in further throughput acceleration and cost reductions. Building upon promising preliminary results from Phase 1 work, we will incorporate the fourth and final T1D autoantibody (ZnT8) to create the world's first ever ?4-in-1? screening panel, creating a product that provides the highest level of risk assessment for T1D screening and diagnosis. These optimized and automated panels will then be rigorously validated with thousands of clinical samples provided by our wide network of enthusiastic academic and institutional partners that include the Joslin Diabetes Center, Stanford School of Medicine, the T1D Exchange and Tufts Children's Hospital. This data will be used to plan and direct commercialization efforts that will include a phased approach from delivering a CLIA-certified laboratory service to FDA-approved reagent kits with companion integrated sample-to-answer hardware devices for easy, low-skill use and deployment across research and clinical laboratories and screening sites worldwide."
"9444430","PROJECT SUMMARY Adult mammals display very limited regeneration capacity. Certain mammalian tissues can regenerate after an injury, but severely damaged organs cannot recover. For instance, nephron epithelium of the mammalian kidney can regenerate after a minor acute injury, but stronger insults result in irreversible nephron loss, causing diminished renal function. This is in stark contrast to many phylogenetically lower animals, which can regenerate a diverse array of organs. These organisms are equipped with toti-/pluri-potent stem cells and/or the ability to de-differentiate their cells to a similar plastic state. On the other hand, adult mammals contain only tissue-specific stem cells with limited plasticity, which contribute only to the regeneration of specific cellular lineages. Therefore, a more extensive regeneration potential may be conferred to mammals by inducing superior cellular plasticity. Such induction has been achieved in vitro by expressing the four Yamanaka factors (4F) (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and cMyc) and thus, it may be possible to harness 4F expression in vivo to enhance mammalian regeneration (long-term goal). Preliminary results showed that intermittent expression of 4F extends the life span of Progeria mice, which typically exhibit accelerated aging. This observation correlated with significant histological improvement in multiple organs, including the kidneys, indicating a regenerative effect of 4F. To specifically characterize whether 4F expression can promote renal regeneration after an injury, a mouse line has been developed that allows lineage tracing of 4F-expressing cells, as well as reporter lines that indicate if renal tubular cells revert to the embryonic progenitor states in response to the in vivo induction of 4F expression. In parallel experiments, conditions have been established for culturing embryonic nephrogenic progenitors, and for transplanting them into mouse hosts. This advancement will allow transplantation of 4F-expressing nephrogenic progenitors into a wild-type mouse to induce 4F expression specifically in the renal parenchyma. Together, these tools provide a unique experimental platform to explore the regenerative effect of 4F. This proposal specifically addresses whether 4F expression can enhance murine renal regeneration following acute kidney injury (AKI). Nephron epithelium de-differentiates following AKI en route to its regeneration. Therefore, one can hypothesize that 4F expression will enhance recovery from AKI by promoting the de-differentiation and plasticity of nephron epithelial cells. This hypothesis will be addressed by transiently expressing 4F ubiquitously or specifically in the kidney and assessing the impact on recovery from AKI. Thus, these exploratory studies seek to reveal a regenerative effect of 4F against AKI, which has the potential to lead to a therapeutic intervention against acute renal failure since chemical-based strategies for boosting or replacing 4F in reprogramming have been reported. Moreover, successful completion of these studies will pave the way toward using this technology to treat a wide range of acute injuries in other organs."
"9452995","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to characterize the composition and dynamics of the proteome of Escherichia coli using quantitative mass spectrometry, and to use those data to inform a coarse-grained proteome flux model that describes the physiological behavior of the bacterium in response to nutrient limitations. Bacteria experience a wide variety of environments, and are subject to both nutrient deprivation and unfavorable environments for growth. The synthesis of cellular proteins is the most energetically expensive aspect of cellular growth, and the synthesis of proteins in response to the environment is tightly controlled. We have observed that the proteome partitions itself into sectors that respond in concert in a linear way in response to limitations for carbon, amino acids, and antibiotic stress. The linear response as a function of growth rate can be captured in a coarse-grained proteome sector model that has a very small number of parameters. A major goal of this project is to extend this model to other limitations and stresses, including phosphorus, sulfur, oxygen, and iron limitation, and osmotic and pH stress. We have also performed pulse labeling experiments that reveal significant turnover of the proteome even under very slow protein synthesis conditions, and a second major goal is to extend the coarse-grained model to include the energetic cost of protein degradation. A third major goal will be to compare proteome changes during nutrient shifts to current theories for the dynamics of growth rate changes. This project is a comprehensive approach to characterize the macroeconomics of protein synthesis and proteome composition in bacteria that will serve as the basis for quantitative models of bacterial physiology under a wide variety of conditions. Understanding bacterial physiology is an important aspect of understanding how bacteria respond in the adverse context of infections or in their beneficial context as part of the microbiome."
"9462656","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue vascularization is one of the most critical components of the natural or assisted regenerative response. Typically, such areas of regeneration are characterized by the presence of nascent vascular structures moving across an interface of normal tissue to healing areas of likely different mechanical properties. Though the molecular and cellular nature of such angiogenic processes are well investigated, not much is known about the mechanical forces that influence the vasculature. It is well established, especially in the musculoskeletal system, that an effective and early vascularization response is central to functional regeneration, a delay or disruption of which can be deleterious to the regenerative process. Our early studies have shown that timing of the mechanical loading is equally important in healing bone tissue and its vascularity. It is thus clear that the mechanical environment exquisitely regulates the vascular networks. 3D constructs examined in tensile loading and luminal fluid shear studies form the bulk of our knowledge base on the interactions of microvessels with their microenvironment. In vivo, especially in musculoskeletal tissue, compression and shear - both bulk and interfacial - are the predominant modes of loading. We believe that external mechanical loading will influence the growth and remodeling of microvasculature by virtue of the direct compressive loads as well as by shear at the interface of the mechanically loaded and unloaded tissue. This proposal examines these questions first in an in vitro model, which is a simplistic recapitulation of the in vivo loading scenario. These studies will inform an in vivo loading model of microvascular growth and mineralization where in addition to the external forces, mineralization induced change in local stiffness is likely to playa role. In parallel, in silico studies, based on an already well-established computational framework for modeling microvascular growth, will be modified to reflect the needs of the current approach. The validated computational model will then allow examination of these mechanical interactions with vascular growth and remodeling in greater detail and more importantly establish a predictive framework based on this relationship that may ultimately guide post-traumatic rehabilitation programs or even the design of engineered vascularized scaffolds."
"9683944","The fungus Candida albicans is a commensal species of the human microbiota. It is also a frequently isolated opportunistic pathogen, responsible for a variety of mucosal and life-threatening systemic infections. The majority of these infections are a result of the ability of C. albicans cells to exist in biofilms ? resilient, surface-associated, communities of cells with unique properties. Many serious infections are highly correlated with implanted medical devices, which provide efficient substrates for biofilm formation.  Recent studies have revealed that pheromone signaling is a novel mechanism promoting the formation of C. albicans biofilms. Pheromone signaling is well established to choreograph mating between C. albicans cells. Surprisingly, however, this program can also induce responding cells to become adherent and undergo biofilm development. Pheromones can drive biofilm formation in co-cultures of cells of opposite mating types. In addition, auto-activation of this pathway can even occur in single sex cultures, which similarly results in enhanced adherence of C. albicans cells and biofilm development. It is therefore clear that pheromones can play a pleiotropic role in driving biofilm formation by multiple C. albicans cell types, both by conventional and non-conventional pheromone signaling pathways. In this proposal, we seek to investigate the mechanism of pheromone-induced biofilm formation, and to address the potential for them to form in vivo using two mammalian models of biofilm infection. The two Aims of the proposal are: Aim 1. To define the mechanism of pheromone-induced biofilm formation. We will determine the mechanism by which pheromone signaling induces biofilm formation in C. albicans. Transcriptional profiling will be performed on a diverse set of clinical isolates during pheromone-induced biofilm formation, and target genes implicated in biofilm formation will be deleted by CRISPR and evaluated for their roles in this process. Aim 2. To determine the role of pheromone signaling on biofilm formation in vivo. We will determine if pheromone-signaling pathways lead to enhanced biofilm formation using two distinct mammalian models of biofilm formation, a rat catheter model and a denture stomatitis model.  Together, completion of these experiments will reveal how pheromone-signaling pathways impact biofilm formation in C. albicans both in vitro and in vivo. Our approach is based on intriguing preliminary data that indicates that introduction of a mixture of two mating types results in enhanced biofilms in an animal model. If successful, this proposal has the potential to transform our understanding of C. albicans biofilm formation, and has direct clinical ramifications for treatment of fungal infections in patients. Overall, the combination of state- of-the-art genomic approaches, molecular genetics, high-resolution microscopy, microfluidic models, and two validated animal models designed to mimic human biofilm infections, provides a powerful combinatorial approach to studying this important clinical problem."
"9514229","ABSTRACT Transseptal (TS) access for left heart procedures is an important and rapidly growing area for diagnostics and therapy delivery with an expected total of over 10 million U.S. patients. In the U.S. and Europe, TS access procedures are used for atrial fibrillation ablation, left atrial appendage occlusion and patent foramen ovale closure as well as treatment of mitral valve regurgitation with the MitraClip (MC). Catheter positioning and device placement for MC has been challenging even for the most experienced interventionalist cardiologists (ICs) and has led to long procedure times with significant x-ray exposure. This emerging therapy necessitates a higher level of catheter stability and control over accuracy during puncture of the fossa ovalis (FO). If the initial puncture is inaccurate, delivery of therapy is virtually impossible which often requires removal, re-engagement and device re-advancement. Thus, initial localization and stabilization on the FO is critical for MC procedures to limit delivery times and x-ray exposure. Additionally, the presence of aneurysmal or fibrotic FO and the constant movement of the heart makes standard TS access puncture unpredictable and contributes to increased risk for atrial or aortic perforation. To overcome these limitations, we have developed and validated the performance and utility of a novel transseptal access catheter (TSAC) that utilizes vacuum suction technology to provide improved catheter localization and stabilization of the FO. The results of our preclinical studies were highly successful and support that through stabilization of the FO (4-fold reduction in puncture force), the TSAC reduces tenting (2.5-fold) to improve puncture accuracy (1.5-fold) compared to standard TS access devices in a clinically relevant animal model of mitral regurgitation. In this Phase II application, we propose an investigational device exemption (IDE) to conduct a human pilot study which will be used to assess primarily device safety and secondarily device feasibility in patients undergoing TS access for MC delivery. To accomplish these Phase II objectives, the following specific aims are proposed: 1) Final Animal Validation: To assess the safety of the TSAC in a set of animals under good-laboratory practice (GLP) conditions to be used for data submission to the FDA and institutional review boards (IRBs); and 2) Human Validation: To assess the contribution of human factors to feasibility in a small group of humans (36 patients) in a double-arm multi-center study. This Phase II study addresses a highly significant national and worldwide clinical need that can impact not just NHLBI, but many other mission areas of NIH. Successful completion of these proposed Aims will allow us to translate our research findings to a commercially available device that could drastically improve TS access procedures and hence, patient outcomes."
"9656213","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Continued alcohol use is facilitated by alcohol's positive (rewarding) properties, whereas its negative (aversive) properties serve to limit consumption. Dependence is associated with greater tolerance to ethanol's aversive properties than its rewarding properties, which is thought to promote continued consumption. The rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) exerts inhibitory control over mesolimbic dopamine neurons and is critically involved in signaling the aversive properties of drugs of abuse. The prelimbic (PrL) subregion of the prefrontal cortex shares several critical functional similarities with the RMTg including facilitating aversion learning and responding to aversive stimuli. Despite these similarities, the projection from the PrL to the RMTg has been largely ignored and remains an open area of investigation. This K99/R00 proposal comprises a comprehensive training and research plan based upon the candidate's (Dr. Elizabeth Burnett) preliminary data identifying a role for the RMTg in signaling the aversive properties of alcohol. During the mentored K99 phase of the award, Dr. Burnett will receive training in cutting-edge laboratory techniques including slice electrophysiology, optogenetics, analysis of synaptic morphology, and virally-mediated trans-synaptic tracing. These techniques will augment her existing expertise in cellular and molecular approaches and behavioral models of alcohol abuse and dependence. Under the guidance of the candidate's mentoring team, which includes the primary mentor (Dr. Judson Chandler) and co-mentor (Dr. John Woodward), the candidate will expand her current studies by testing a novel hypothesis that alcohol-induced plasticity in the PrL-RMTg pathway plays a role in the functional consequences of chronic ethanol exposure. Aim 1 will investigate the effect of selective activation of the PrL-RMTg pathway during dependence-induced escalated and aversion-resistant ethanol intake using in vivo optogenetics in combination with operant behavioral testing. Aim 2 will use whole-cell patch-clamp slice electrophysiology and in vitro optogenetics to examine the effect of chronic ethanol exposure on synaptic plasticity within the PrL-RMTg. Aim 3 will define the PrL-RMTg's expanded neurocircuitry by identifying neurons that synapse onto PrL neurons projecting to the RMTg using virally-mediated trans- synaptic retrograde tracing. Experiments under this aim will also determine the involvement of these newly identified second-order RMTg inputs in chronic ethanol exposure by measuring cFos induction in these neurons during withdrawal. The results of these studies will provide new insights into the role of the PrL-RMTg pathway in promoting escalated alcohol consumption. Improving our understanding of the neurocircuitry involved in mediating the aversive component(s) of alcohol consumption may help uncover new therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorders. The training Dr. Burnett will receive during the mentored K99 phase of the award will facilitate her career development and the results obtained during the R00 phase of the award will form the foundation of Dr. Burnett's independent research program."

"9442048","A motivational interviewing intervention customized by patient adherence patterns  Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/ angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are highly recommended for patients with both diabetes (DM) and hypertension (HTN), and their efficacy in reducing macrovascular and microvascular complications of DM is well-documented. Poor adherence remains a significant barrier to achieving full effectiveness and optimal long-term outcomes. This study aims to develop innovative group-based trajectory models to identify patients with similar ACE/ARB medication filling behavior among patients with co-morbid HTN and DM. The proportion of days covered (PDC), often used as an adherence measure, reduces complex patterns of longitudinal observations into a single value that cannot adequately depict different adherence experiences. Group based trajectory models are designed to identify patients with similar longitudinal patterns while capturing the dynamic nature. A motivational interviewing (MI) pharmacy student telephone intervention will then be customized by the identified trajectories and tested to demonstrate effectiveness in enhancing adherence. In pilot work, our team has demonstrated improvements in adherence through a pharmacy student telephone MI intervention. Pharmacy students have the knowledge base and training to provide comparable services to pharmacists at a lower cost. MI fosters behavior change by setting desired goals and promoting self-efficacy in a supportive, collaborative way. The objectives are to 1. Develop group-based trajectory models to identify patients with similar medication filling behavior patterns among patients enrolled in a Medicare advantage plan and 2. Customize an MI pharmacy student telephone intervention by the adherence patterns identified, and demonstrate the benefit of the customized intervention in improving adherence. Phase 1 of the project will be a retrospective analysis of 12 month refill data to determine patient adherence patterns. Phase 2 will be a prospective study among non-adherent patients to evaluate the effectiveness of the customized intervention (n=500). The students will contact patients assigned to the intervention group and follow a protocol using the Ask-Provide-Ask approach of MI given the patient adherence pattern for a tailored education. Monthly follow-up calls will be carried out for 6 months. Adherence during the 6 and 12 months post-intervention will be evaluated for the intervention and control groups as PDC as well as a categorical variable. Chi-square and t-tests will be used to evaluate the intervention effect. Multivariable multiple and logistic regression will be carried out in case of any significant differences in baseline characteristics. Implementing this project will provide students a unique MI training as a new way of communicating with patients. The training is further strengthened by PhD students trained in research design and statistical analyses to assist in the automated data analysis. The project will formulate a strong adherence research team at University of Houston that will be instrumental in implementing customized innovative interventions to improve medication adherence and subsequent health outcomes."
"9473798","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common genetic disorder in humans, with more than 160 point mutations in this gene, and over 400 million people affected. Although most research relates to G6PD deficiency and increased hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells) and accumulation of bilirubin in adults, epidemiological studies indicate that G6PD deficiency is also a major cause of pathologic neonatal bilirubin accumulation (jaundice) and a contributor to morbidity, including neurological injury (kernicterus). The hypothesis to be tested here is that correcting the activity and stability of G6PD mutants as well as increasing the activity of the wild-type enzyme will decrease bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity in infants. In this proposal, the plan to begin developing a treatment for kernicterus using a totally novel approach, by developing activators of wild-type (Wt) and mutant G6PDs is described. The project includes four aims: AIM 1: Identify small molecule chaperones that increase the catalytic activity of Wt and common G6PD mutants using an in vitro screen of a library of small molecules. AIM 2: Determine the X-ray crystal structure of the Wt and mutant G6PD enzymes in complex with the G6PD chaperone(s). Aim 3: Evaluate the ability of the chaperone(s) to protect cultured cells expressing Wt or the mutant G6PDs from bilirubin-induced cytotoxicity and elucidate the molecular basis of their effects. AIM 4: Evaluate the ability of the small molecule chaperone(s) to reduce bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity in rodent models of newborn hyperbilirubinemia, in vivo. Two established rat models of kernicterus (Gunn rats and bilirubin-injected Wt rats) and three new mouse models [transgenic mice, mimicking three common G6PD mutations with kernicterus] will be used. Small molecules, identified in Aim 3 to protect neurons from bilirubin-induced toxicity, will be tested for their ability to prevent or reduce neurological injury (measured as loss of motor and auditory skills) due to hyperbilirubinemia in one or more of these rodent models, in vivo. The experience of Dr. Stevenson (co-PI) in basic research related to hyperbilirubinemia and in clinical care of such newborns, the expertise of Dr. Wakatsuki in crystallography, together with our expertise in drug discovery and development and in neuroscience research, and the expertise of other advisors in drug screening, medicinal chemistry, in gene editing and in assessing auditory and motor dysfunctions, place the team in a unique position to address the above goals."
"9461411","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nuclear receptor transcription factor PPAR? is an established target for FDA approved drugs for patients with type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These drugs and numerous other known ligands that bind PPAR? increase insulin sensitivity T2DM patients. Most of the PPAR?-binding drugs also display adverse side effects, including increased risk of bone fractures, weight gain, and heart disease. Despite these negative indications, PPAR? remains an important T2DM therapeutic target. Detailed understanding of how ligands affect PPAR? activity may facilitate the development of new drugs with fewer adverse effects. The transcription of PPAR? target genes is affected, in part, by small molecule ligands that bind to its ligand-binding domain (LBD) and change the interaction between PPAR? and coregulator proteins (corepressors and coactivators). In the inactive transcriptionally repressive form, PPAR? is bound to corepressor proteins. Binding of an agonist ligand, including FDA approved drugs that target PPAR?, causes a conformational change that releases corepressors and allows binding of coactivators; this generally results in an increase the expression of PPAR? target genes. While many crystal structures have been reported for PPAR? bound to coactivator peptides and agonist ligands, no structural data has been reported for PPAR? bound to a corepressor. Agonist ligands stabilize the activation function-2 (AF-2) surface, decreasing binding affinity for corepressors while increasing affinity for coactivators. The stabilized AF-2 surface with coactivators likely explains the numerous PPAR? crystal structures bound to coactivator peptides. However, our preliminary data show that a dynamic AF-2 surface, which samples multiple conformations, facilitates corepressor binding. The dynamics of the AF-2 surface when bound to a corepressor may explain why no crystal structure of PPAR? bound to a corepressor has been reported, since the dynamic surface could inhibit crystal formation. Using a multidisciplinary approach combining NMR, biochemical, biophysical and cell- based functional methods we seek to report the first structural understanding of how corepressor proteins bind PPAR?. The connection of PPAR? corepressor binding to functional effects could aid in the design of novel compounds targeting PPAR? with lower unwanted side effects profiles."

Experimental modules in the course will include an introduction to the design and use of animal virus vectors in neuroscience research; the use of CRISPR genome editing and RNAi approaches for regulating the expression of specific genes in neurons and glia; practical exercises in gene delivery systems including mammalian cell infection and transfection and electroporation techniques for targeted gene transfer in vivo; an introduction to overall strategies, use and design of BAC transgenic vectors; real time RT-PCR analyses; assays of chromatin and chromatin structure in neurons, and mRNA isolation from specified neural subtypes by translating ribosome affinity purification. Experimental techniques are taught in the context of the broader conceptual advances that they may provide. The course invites lecturers who have made significant contributions in their fields to give up-to-the-minute reports on current research. The trainees are chosen by the course faculty from larger pools of applicants and range from graduate students to senior investigators and research physicians. Because of the short duration of this course, senior, as well as junior individuals can attend and receive a short, intense period of training in an environment remote from other demands on their time and attention. The ATMN course also provides an unusual opportunity for established scientists to apply these advanced techniques to their own research interests, or to retrain in an important specialty within neuroscience with which they may not be familiar. Methods and concepts taught in the course are disseminated to the wider research community through the publication of laboratory manuals and online resources."
"9526982","Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) is a major pathologic substrate of dementia but there currently are no validated strategies in the clinical setting to diagnose or treat the disease. HS-Aging affects ~15% of elderly persons and is associated with substantial cognitive impairment. Our group has studied this area extensively, leading to the following major hypothesis: thyroid hormone (TH) dysregulation contributes to HS-Aging pathogenesis. This novel pathogenetic mechanism may provide the basis to diagnose HS- Aging during life using CSF analyses, and to develop a therapeutic strategy. However, critical knowledge gaps remain in terms of characterizing the specific association between TH dysfunction and brain pathology, and the potential to target the mechanism for therapeutic purposes. We propose a research program to fill these knowledge gaps while testing key hypotheses via the following Specific Aims: Hypothesis 1: Clinical TH status is associated with presence and severity of HS-Aging pathology. Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis in a convenience sample (n=205, including cognitively intact and diverse non-HS-Aging dementia controls) from the University of Kentucky AD Center biobank. We will apply rigorous, quantitative digital pathologic methods to assess TDP-43 pathology, AD plaques/tangles, and ?- synucleinopathy for correlation with clinical TH status: self-reported TH disease and TH medications are well- documented. As expected in aged persons, more than 25% of the subjects exhibited clinical TH dysfunction. Hypothesis 2: CSF TH levels are associated with HS-Aging pathology and may provide a novel biomarker. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate TH (triiodothyronine, or T3) in CSF as a clinical biomarker of HS-Aging. We will assess human CSF TH levels with direct correlation with various subtypes of pathology. We also will test TH in clinical CSF from lumbar punctures, correlated with established AD-related biomarkers (A? and tau) and HS-Aging SNPs, with the goal of developing a new method to diagnose HS-Aging in living persons. We have obtained CSF from autopsied individuals (n=104) and clinical CSF samples (n=195) to accomplish this Aim. Hypothesis 3: Specific HS-Aging risk-associated gene variants induce altered brain TH levels with extensive impact on brain gene expression, and orally available drugs can alter this pathogenetic mechanism. Specific Aim 3: Define gene expression changes relevant to TH and HS-Aging. We will analyze human genomics databases to define how gene changes linked to HS-Aging risk contribute to variability in ABCC9 and SLCO1C1 (a major brain TH transporter) expression. We will test human cells (cultured human hESC astrocytes and lymphoblastoid cells transformed with DNA from people with known genotypes and pathology) to determine the potential for manipulating the levels of ABCC9, of TH transporter SLCO1C1, and of other TH- regulated genes. Finally, in mice, we will test how TH-responsive gene expression, neuropathology, and neurobehavior are affected in vivo by treatment with TH and/or the ABCC9 agonist drug glimepiride."
"9520146","Project Summary/Abstract A major focus of the UC San Diego Superfund Research Program Center (SRC) is on the impact of toxicant exposure on the development of liver cancers and fibrosis with an emphasis on Toxicant-Associated Steatoheptatitis (TASH). As part of this project, we focus on the role of several hazardous substances on the Priority List of Hazardous Substances by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Current analytical techniques used for the detection of such pollutants/toxicants are generally expensive to use and typically done in the lab setting. Clearly, there is a great need for cheap biosensors for specific detection of toxicants that is: (1) inexpensive to produce, (2) easy to use, (3) portable/deployable in the field, and (4) a game- changing research tool for studying environmental health sciences. We have, therefore, developed an innovative technique that will make it possible to detect and quantitate metals and other environmental toxicants by creating genetically encodable molecular sensors. Using a new and powerful molecular evolution platform, we combine non-homologous site-to-site recombination on modest sized libraries with selection strategies to discover protein biosensors that light upon addition of a specific ligand or small molecular weight toxicant. These biosensors can also be made to become molecular switches that will turn ?ON? and light/fluoresce with desired color/wavelength upon binding as well as reversibly turn ?OFF? when the small molecules diffuse away, providing a dynamic measure of its concentration. Protein biosensors and switches will allow us to track toxicants such as metals (As, Cd, Pb, Hg) and other ubiquitous environmental agents such as organochlorides, polycylics, and dioxins. We envision developing panels of inexpensive small-molecule biosensors that can be spotted on filter paper, for example, to do rapid on-site detection of toxicants and metals."

"9462886","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma affects more than 300 million people worldwide, but despite the current availability of multiple therapies, many patients remain refractory to standard treatments. Furthermore, specific therapies have been linked to adverse and sometimes life-threatening reactions. Thus, an urgent need for new therapies exists. Asthma is associated with chronic airway inflammation that involves both the innate and adaptive immune systems. While Th2 cells and eosinophils play key roles in the pathogenesis of the majority of asthma cases, recently Th17 cells have been implicated in a subgroup of asthmatics associated with neutrophilic airway inflammation and corticosteroid-resistance. Thus, Th2 and Th17 cells represent potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of asthma. Nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) are validated anti-inflammatory therapeutic targets. This proposal is based on findings that the NHRs PPAR? and REV-ERB? are expressed in Th2 and Th17 cells, where they attenuate T cell effector function and suppress IL-4 and IL-17A expression, respectively. Since both Th2 and Th17 cells are associated with asthma development and pathogenesis, this proposal will investigate whether PPAR? and REV-ERB? are therapeutically accessible targets to ameliorate airway inflammation and asthma. The goal of Aim 1 is to determine the role of PPAR? in Th2 associated airway inflammation and airway hyper-reactivity (AHR), utilizing wild-type and T cell-specific PPAR? knockout (PPAR? cKO) mice in an ovalbumin-induced AHR model. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical potential of PPAR? will be determined by comparing responses of wild-type and PPAR? cKO mice to the PPAR? ligand rosiglitazone (Rosi), in the AHR model. In Aim 2, the molecular mechanisms underlying PPAR? and the corepressor SMRT functions in Th2 cells will be characterized. Global transcriptomic and cistromic analyses will be conducted in Th2 cells in the absence or presence of PPAR? ligand and these results correlated to identify direct and indirect PPAR? targets. The goal of Aim 3 is to determine the role of REV-ERB? in Th17-associated airway inflammation and AHR using novel T cell-specific REV-ERB? loss-of-function and gain-of-function mouse models, as well as a synthetic REV-ERB agonist, to test the hypothesis that activating REV-ERB? can ameliorate Th17 cell associated AHR and asthma. In Aim 4, the molecular mechanism of REV-ERB? and ROR?t interactions in Th17 cells will be dissected by mapping the ROR? and REV-ERB? cistromes to gain mechanistic insight into their global DNA binding activities. These genomic binding maps will be compared with transcriptional outcomes in wild-type and REV-ERB? knockout Th17 cells, with the goal of elucidating the REV-ERB? dependent transcriptional network. The proposed studies will advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of PPAR? and REV-ERB? actions in T helper cell subsets, and explore their therapeutic potential in T cell function to ameliorate airway inflammation and asthma."

Despite years of research, the regulation of the inflammatory response after G- bacterial infection remains unclear, thus impeding the development of novel therapeutic/diagnostic strategies. Mammalian genomes encode thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs are extensively expressed in various immune cells including the monocytes, and macrophages. The lncRNAs have been reported to be involved in diverse biological processes, including the regulation of the expression of genes, the dosage compensation and genomics imprinting, but as yet very less research has been carried out to explore how they alter cell differentiation/function during host- pathogens interactions. We found that Lincenc1 is strikingly induced in the lungs obtained from the mice infected with G- bacteria or after exposure to LPS, an abundant glycolipid of the outer membrane of G- bacteria. Furthermore, our in vitro data suggest that Lincenc1 is induced in macrophages but not in other cells, such as the epithelial cells and neutrophils. Functionally, Lincenc1 promotes the classical activation of macrophages and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Here we propose that lncRNA Lincenc1 promotes G- bacterial/LPS induced lung inflammation via activating alveolar macrophages. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following two specific aims: Specific Aim I: To investigate the role of Lincenc1 in macrophage activation in vitro. Specific Aim 2: To investigate the role of Lincenc1 in lung inflammation in vivo. Successful completion of the proposed aims will uncover the role of Lincenc1 in G- bacterial infections. This study potentially will help to identify novel mechanisms and/or therapeutic strategies for lung inflammation and injury."
"9464354","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ninety percent of those diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are women, with peak incidence between the ages of 15 and 45, when women are most hormonally active. Despite significant research effort, the mechanisms underlying this sex bias remain unclear. Our laboratory previously backcrossed estrogen receptor alpha knockout (ER?KO) mice onto the NZM2410 lupus prone background. We demonstrated that female NZM/ER?KO mice had significantly less renal disease and significantly prolonged survival compared to WT littermates despite similar serum autoantibodies and glomerular immune complex deposition. ER?KO mice are not ER? null, but rather express an N-terminally truncated ER?. They have physiologic deficiencies including infertility due to disruption of a critical activation domain (AF-1). We showed that dendritic cell (DCs) from NZM/ER?KO mice have a blunted inflammatory response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. When these mice were ovariectomized, the protective phenotype was lost. Upon estradiol-repletion, protection was restored. True ER? null mice are not protected, suggesting that estrogen in the presence of the AF-1 mutant confers protection, rather than the absence of the full-length ER?66. Interestingly, the truncated ER? expressed in the ER?KO animal is structurally similar to ER?46, an endogenous ER? splice variant that lacks the AF-1 domain, and is a negative regulator of gene transcription. ER?46 has an identical DNA binding domain to ER?66 and is a powerful inhibitor of ER?66. We hypothesize that ER?46 expression has a protective effect in lupus. The goal of this project is to determine the role of ER?46 in SLE and TLR-induced inflammation and to improve our understanding of ER?-mediated transcription in the setting of inflammation. In order to accomplish this, Dr. Cunningham will (1) Define the in vitro molecular mechanisms underlying ER?46- and ER?66-regulated transcriptional activity impacting the innate inflammatory response of murine DCs, (2) Determine ex vivo and in vivo the role of ER?46 in TLR-induced lupus utilizing a murine strain expressing an A/B truncation mutant of ER? (ER?AF10), and (3) Use human peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC)-derived DCs to define the role of ER?46 and ER?66 in regulation of the innate immune response in DCs from controls vs. lupus patients. Dr. Cunningham is a clinician-investigator with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent basic and translational researcher in the field of immunology with a focus on SLE. To facilitate her transition to independence, she seeks to further her training in dendritic cell biology, ChIPseq and bioinformatics, and the use of human cells from patient samples. Dr. Cunningham has a mentorship team with an outstanding mentoring track record and wide expertise to support her project. The studies proposed in this K08 mentored grant application will significantly advance the field by providing understanding of ER?-mediated transcription in the setting of TLR-induced inflammation, including ER? binding partners, gene targets, and modulation by ER?46, which represents a potential therapeutic agent."
"9460011","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the term chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has only recently entered the research and common vernacular, the neuropsychiatric sequelae have been recognized for decades as dementia pugilistica (DP) in some individuals with careers in boxing. Yet, despite the intense new interest in `CTE', the number of reported cases has been surprisingly limited and there are no validated neuropathological diagnostic criteria to define it as a distinct disease entity. Notwithstanding this, there is a widely held, abeit unfounded, perception that repetitive TBI (rTBI) alone culminates in `CTE' and that `CTE' is primarily characterized by a unique tau pathology. However, multiple neuropathological features have been reported for DP/CTE beyond tau pathologies, including brain atrophy, amyloid-? plaques, TDP-43 pathologies and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, it is now recognized that almost all of these pathologies are observed in a proportion of cases years after just one moderate to severe single TBI (sTBI). As TBI-associated neurodegeneration has become a major health concern, there is a clear and pressing need to develop robust operational neuropathological criteria for diagnosis, which will, in turn, be critical to the success of all fuure mechanistic, diagnostic and interventional studies. Towards this end, we have assembled an international, multidisciplinary team of experts who provide unparalleled experience in both the study of long-term neurodegeneration after TBI, and the development of optimized assessment of common neuropathological diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Through our team members, we have custodial access to the only comprehensive TBI brain archives in the US and UK that include both sTBI and rTBI cases as well as ~1500 longitudinally followed and extensively characterized autopsy confirmed cases of AD and related disorders for comparison. For our primary Aim 1, we will use a standardized approach successfully applied to AD, to generate baseline diagnostic neuropathological criteria using existing post-mortem material of sTBI and rTBI. In Aim 2 we will pursue biochemical, and genetic studies to explore potential associations with neuropathological outcomes from chronic TBI. In Aim 3 we will explore the temporal course of neuroinflammation to examine its potential role in progressive neurodegeneration following TBI. Finally, in Aim 4 will secure a networked archive of the extensive resources of data and biospecimens generated in Aims 1-3 for wider access across the research community."
"9460992","PROJECT SUMMARY The heterogeneous, multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease and the overlap of its temporal course with changes attributable to typical aging has been a critical barrier to the development of diagnostic tools and interventions targeting the direct effects of the disease on brain function and cognition. A major challenge is to understand how multiple age-related cascades combine in an individual to create vulnerabilities to cognitive decline during the progression of Alzheimer's disease. One prominent age-related cascade involves disruption of the dopaminergic system. While the dopamine system is not generally understood to be a direct contributor to Alzheimer's disease, patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibit impairments in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway and dopamine may play a role in the severity of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. This application proposes a disconnection model in which parallel pathways lead from neuropathological alterations to impaired brain network integrity and cognition. These parallel pathways are proposed to have direct and indirect points of interaction by which age-linked dopaminergic changes induce vulnerabilities to tauopathy and amyloidosis. That is, this is a ?dual hit? model where individuals with pre- existing age-related dopaminergic disruption are proposed to be more likely to exhibit declines in network integrity and cognition in the presence of tauopathy and amyloidosis. The overall goal is to test whether the pathways proposed by this model induce vulnerabilities during the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Each aim tests a different set of pathways in the model.  First, the project tests an Alzheimer's disease cascade whereby tauopathy and amyloidosis impact integrity of a network known as the default network, leading to change in memory performance. Second, the project tests an age-related cascade whereby dopaminergic function impacts integrity of a frontoparietal control network, leading to change in executive function. Third, the project tests whether increased vulnerability to the Alzheimer's disease cascade is a function of network alterations from the age-related dopaminergic cascade. To test these aims, the project applies simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography data to acquire multiple measures of brain function and pathology. A sample of cognitively normal older adults and patients with mild cognitive impairment is tested and followed over time to cover the early spectrum of progression toward Alzheimer's disease. Successful completion will aid differential diagnosis, provide a model for vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease that could be extended to other age-related cascades, and provide alternative targets for bolstering neural integrity to delay or prevent vulnerability during the progression of early Alzheimer's disease."
"9454077","Project Summary The Gastrointestinal Experimental Model Systems (GEMS) core is a newly reorganized of the Texas Medical Center-Digestive & Disease Center (TMC-DDC) in 2015. Based on examination of prior usage, reviewer comments from the previous competitive renewal, and the recommendation of the external advisory committee, the GEMS core is organized to encompass 1) an enteroid/organoid subcore and 2) a gnotobiotic subcore. The DDC successfully obtained Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) support to establish a gnotobiotic animal facility during the previous Project Period. This reorganization was based on the exciting scientific developments in the field, our unique expertise, increased DDC investigator need and use of enteroids and gnotobiotic animals in conjunction with decreased use of the physiology services offered by the previous Integrative Biology Core. To accomplish these aims, we will provide services, including the following:  ? Human enteroids from the TMC-DDC biobank: as 3-dimensional enteroids, monolayers or transwells  ? Murine enteroids from the TMC-DDC biobank  ? Complete growth media or components for growth and differentiation of human and animal enteroids  ? Derivation of new primary enteroids from animals or human tissue specimens  ? Derivation of stably transduced enteroid lines  ? Human pluripotent stem cell-derived intestinal organoids, made from embryonic stem cells or iPS cells  ? Xenograft generation of enteroids/organoids into immunodeficient mice  ? Production and maintenance of germ-free rodents  ? Technical services for studies involving gnotobiotic rodents  ? Creation of germ-free mice de novo  ? Training, outreach, and consultative services Importantly, there is no other similar facility in the TMC or nearby in the region. This Core is highly synergetic with the other scientific cores of the TMC-DDC. For example, extensive cooperation with Core E (Clinical Core) facilitates the development and approval of new IRB protocols and collection/tracking of tissue samples required to establish new human enteroid lines. Evidence of the success of this interaction is apparent in the >120 enteroids lines that are already established and the continued accrual of new samples targeting specific patient populations."
"9470803","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi Myopathy (MM) are caused by mutations in dysferlin, but the role of dysferlin in healthy muscle and the changes that occur when it is mutated are still poorly understood. Although earlier studies suggested that dysferlin acts at the sarcolemma, our recent studies have yielded unexpected results: we find that dysferlin is selectively enriched in the transverse tubules (t- tubules: TT) of skeletal muscle. Challenging dysferlin null muscle with lengthening contractions in vivo or osmotic shock in vitro disrupts TT and causes Ca2+ channels to open, leading to significant changes in Ca2+ handling. In a recent FRET study, we obtained results to suggest that dysferlin and the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), the L-type Ca2+ channel that concentrates in TT at triad junctions (TJ), are located within 10 nm of one another in situ. Based on these preliminary results, we hypothesize that dysferlin protects muscle from injury-induced disruption of TT and dysregulation of Ca2+ by associating with DHPR and ryanodine receptors (RyR1) at TJ. We will test this hypothesis in experiments in healthy and dysferlin null muscles by studying the organization of TT, regulation of Ca2+ transients and baseline Ca2+ levels, and mechanochemical coupling between DHPR and RyR1. We will injure dysferlin-null and control muscles in vitro and ex vivo and muscle fibers in vitro and then apply ultrastructural approaches and state-of-the-art fluorescence-based imaging methods, including FRAP and FRET, to study the structural and functional changes in TT and TJ. We will test drugs that block L-type Ca2+ channels, stretch-activated channels, and ryanodine receptors, for their ability to protect dysferlin-null muscle from injury in vitro and in vivo. We will also prepare dysferlin variants, missing one or more of its structural domains or with point mutations linked to LGMD2B/MM, to identify the regions of dysferlin required to restore the structure and function of TT and TJ of dysf -/- muscle and to protect them from damage following stress. We have 3 specific aims: (1) to determine the role of dysferlin in regulating the function of TT and TJ; (2) to determine the role of dysferlin in regulating the structure and stability of TT and TJ; and (3) to identify the domains of dysferlin needed for it to concentrate in TT, interact with DHPR and RyR1 at TJ, and protect fibers from damage under stress. Our experiments will critically test our hypothesis that dysferlin protects TT structurally and functionally from damage by interacting with the two key components of TJ, DHPR and RyR1. They will elucidate the roles of dysferlin in skeletal muscle and how its absence leads to dysferlinopathy, and may suggest new avenues of treatment for LGMD2B/MM."
"9447323","PROJECT SUMMARY  Low-grade or unresolved inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of many human diseases. Common sleep patterns of restricting sleep during the work week and ?catching up? on sleep over the weekend lead to inflammatory upregulation that does not recover completely after the weekend.  Goal of this proposal is to investigate, for the first time, inflammatory resolution pathways. Inflammatory resolution mediators, such as resolvins, are derived from omega-3 free fatty acids and actively ?turn-off? inflammation. Based on preliminary data from our lab, we hypothesize that common sleep restriction- recovery patterns disrupt inflammatory resolution pathways, making it difficult to return to inflammatory homeostasis. If true, pharmacologically increasing the body?s natural production of endogenous inflammatory resolution mediators may one day provide a way to reduce the detrimental inflammatory consequences of common sleep restriction-recovery patterns.  The hypothesis will be tested using an experimental model that mimics common patterns of restricting sleep on week days and ?catching up? on sleep on the weekend. The proposal will further utilize the unique ability of low-dose aspirin, which ? like no other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ? is able to activate inflammatory resolution pathways. Healthy women and men between the ages of 18 to 50 years will be tested under three 10-day long in-hospital stays, during which they will be exposed to control sleep or common patterns of sleep restriction-recovery. The two sleep restriction-recovery stays will be combined with preemptive administration of low-dose aspirin or placebo. Aim 1 will investigate whether exposure to commonly experienced sleep patterns of sleep restriction followed by recovery sleep will not only activate inflammatory (e.g., interleukin-6), but disrupt inflammatory resolution pathways (e.g., resolvins), as well. Aim 2 will test that activation of inflammatory resolution pathways by aspirin dampens the inflammatory response to sleep restriction. Aim 3 is target-unspecific and will profile a wide range of resolution lipid mediators using a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) platform, which may fuel the search of a biomarker to be used in the monitoring of sleep health.  Targeting inflammatory resolution pathways could provide a novel, non-behavioral strategy to mitigate both inflammatory consequences and future disease risks in those undergoing periods of sleep restriction-recovery patterns ? a behavior pattern that is unlikely to be eradicated in the near future, as changes in sleep are generally difficult to make and to maintain."
"9529489","Project Summary/Abstract  Growing evidence has indicated that exposure of nanoparticles such as MnO2, CuO, TiO2, etc., due to increasing use of these engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), induces nanoneurotoxicity that may pose risks for having neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), etc. However, the mechanisms of in vivo exposure and its potential contribution to neurodegeneration are not well known. Hence, our long-range objective is to study exposure of ENMs such as metal oxide nanoparticles and their nanoneurotoxicity and potential correlation to human diseases such as AD using both in vitro and in vivo disease models and imaging modalities. The specific hypothesis for this proposal is that exposure of CuO nanoparticles increases blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, enhances neurodegeneration, exacerbates cerebral A? amyloid pathology and associated neuroinflammation and redox stress, alter brain cytokine, biometal, and energy metabolic profiles. We base the hypothesis on previous observations and current key pilot data which suggest that: (i) long-term exposure to severe air pollution (highly possible exposure of metal oxide nanoparticles) is associated with neuroinflammation, BBB disruption, and A?1-42 accumulation (the salient neuropathological features of AD); (ii) CuO nanoparticle exposure increases BBB permeability via inhalation; (iii) exposure of CuO nanoparticles induce in vitro neurotoxicity, inflammation, and oxidative stress. To test our current hypothesis, we will (i) determine the effects of CuO nanoparticle inhalation on in vivo blood- brain barrier integrity and enhanced neurodegeneration; (ii) assess the effects of CuO nanoparticle inhalation on neuroinflammation, cerebral oxidative stress and A? amyloid pathology; (iii) evaluate the effects of CuO nanoparticle inhalation on memory function, biometal profiles in A? amyloid plaques and brain metabolic activities. We will use in vivo microSPECT (micro Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) imaging and histology detection methods, cytokine microfluidic biochip assays, oxidative stress (4-HNE) and A? ELISA assays, high-energy X-ray fluorescence microscopy (µ-XRM) via the measurement of x-ray absorption spectra (µ-XAS) and x-ray absorption near edge spectra (µ-XANES) coupled with laser capture microdissection (LCM) tissue procuring technique, MRI/MRS, Morris Water Maze (MWM) memory test, and PS1/APP AD transgenic mouse model to achieve these experimental aims. Using our integrated experimental approaches, we believe that we will gain knowledge that can contribute to the making of public policy on regulating nanoparticle exposure and its neurotoxic effects upon the Central Nervous System (CNS), and further our understanding about potential risk of metal oxide nanoparticle exposure for neurodegeneration. More importantly, it will establish an experimental paradigm that will be very useful for investigating the nanoneurotoxicity and its potential contribution to etiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD."
"9446882","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How much variability is there in normal, healthy brains, and when do variations in specific circuit components result in the circuit dysregulation that is thought responsible for many psychiatric and neurological disorders? These questions will be studied in a small motor circuit, the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion, in which it is possible to identify and record from all of the circuit neurons. The variability in the expression f genes for voltage-dependent ion channels and receptors will be measured in every identified cell type in the circuit, and correlations among them explored. Channel and receptor gene expression will be compared across cells, and between somata and the neuropil. Voltage-clamp experiments will be used to determine whether membrane currents correlate with the expression of the genes thought to encode the proteins responsible for those currents. Channel and receptor correlations in specific identified neurons will be studied subsequent to perturbations by temperature acclimation and removal of neuromodulatory inputs. Finally, a large data base of motor patterns will be created, analyzed, and made available to allow the study of variability of motor patterns and their response to perturbation across thousands of healthy animals."
"9483958","Project Summary The need for veterinarians trained as biomedical scientists is well-documented. We request here continued funding to support four post-DVM fellows per year for three years of research training. Optimal research training exists when qualified and motivated trainees work in the laboratories of experienced, productive and well-funded scientist mentors. Such mentors impart the knowledge, work habits, communicative skills and research skills enabling trainees to succeed as independent scientists and contributors to multidisciplinary research teams. These scientists will be skilled both in the use of animal models and the application of cellular, immunologic, molecular, genomic or translational approaches to address questions of human health significance. Promising trainees identified through a summer fellowship program and multiple other strategies are encouraged to apply to this program. Diversity is sought through a multi-level outreach program. Trainees typically enroll in the Graduate School of Wake Forest University and pursue a PhD degree in one of the 7 biomedical tracks offered at Wake Forest School of Medicine. Trainees will choose a Mentor from among a group of well-funded and experienced scientists and educators and will be assigned an Associate Mentor with expertise relevant to the trainee's research project. Associate Mentors are faculty members without independent research funding and/or with limited training experience, but with critical clinical or core laboratory expertise. This co-mentoring approach will allow Associate Mentors to gain training experience in a team setting. There are 19 Mentors with independent research programs and funding, and an additional 6 Associate Mentors. Of the training faculty, 9 are DVMs (including 5 DVM/PhD or DVM/MS researchers), 18 are PhDs, and 4 are MDs (including 3 MD/PhDs). In addition to mentored research and required coursework, all trainees will attend weekly research seminars and journal clubs. Training in the responsible conduct of research is integral and includes mentoring, didactic sessions, and group discussion. Structured evaluations of both the trainees and the program are conducted annually. There are 6 areas of research emphasis, based on interest in training and networks of collaboration among productive, funded investigative groups: 1) cardiovascular disease/diabetes, 2) cancer biology, 3) women's health and reproductive medicine 4) microbiology and immunology, and 5) radiation injury, and 6) regenerative medicine. Unique features of the research environment include access to national primate resources; a world-class program in tissue engineering at The Wake Forest Institute of Regenerative Medicine; the Wake Forest Translational Science Institute; and our long- standing collaborative veterinary training programs in Indonesia. In the past 15 years, 14 fellows have completed research training through this program, and 12 remain in academic, industry or government biomedical research. Nine sought and were awarded PhDs. Three fellows will defend in 2018. Seventy-six scientific publications have resulted from T32-supported projects in the past 10 years."
"9438475","Abstract The Colorado Alphaherpesvirus Latency Society (CALS) was established in 2011 to provide a venue for open exchange of unpublished data from leading clinical and research scientists, with the goal of eliminating disease in the elderly caused by alphaherpesvirus reactivation. The 2-day CALS meeting format features 30 concise presentations, each followed by extended discussions. A significant innovation that increases the impact of CALS is a plenary presentation by a world- class neuroscientist not involved in virology, whose talk provides unique perspectives that often initiate new areas of study. The 21-member CALS planning committee (all non-paid, highly productive and established researchers) participates in selection of plenary speakers and poster presentations, and guides the Society in all major decisions. CALS is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt educational organization. The annual symposium does not charge a registration fee and has been financed in part through charitable contributions from corporate sponsors and an R13 conference support award from the NIH. The requested funds will maintain the high caliber of the meeting, which includes student/postdoctoral fellow mentorship and education through in-depth, one-on-one discussions with leaders in the field along with written critiques of their project, and an open forum wherein individuals in academia, industry and government positions address career questions. New to CALS symposia is a session dedicated to mechanics and philosophy of grant writing (F31, F32 and R01 applications) for students/postdoctoral fellows/early-stage investigators by a volunteer team of established investigators with extensive NIH study section experience. CALS is also aware of underrepresented minorities in science and has established two new collaborations to draw this important group into the field through early identification and mentorship. The recognized success of past CALS symposia has made this meeting the premier venue for highly focused discussions of key issues by world experts addressing all aspects of disease in the elderly caused by reactivation of latent alphaherpesviruses, along with the efficient, productive training of future investigators. "
"9456665","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sabrina Noel, PhD, RD is currently a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. She has advanced training in nutrition and epidemiology and experience working in both clinical and community settings. Dr. Noel's experience with diet and metabolic health research, and exposure to work with disparities in bone health, has encouraged her to pursue a career in population-based bone research. Her goal is to evaluate the effects of dietary quality on bone health and to develop a culturally and literacy-tailored behavior change intervention targeting dietary and physical activity behaviors among Caribbean Hispanic adults. In contrast to what has been earlier believed, Hispanics have recently been shown to have higher prevalence of osteoporosis, compared with non-Hispanic whites; however, most of this research has focused on Mexican Americans because of their majority status in the U.S. Hispanic population. Caribbean origin Hispanics are one of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. population and are underrepresented in bone- related research. Preliminary data from a large study of Puerto Rican adults in Boston, MA, indicates that Caribbean Hispanics are at higher risk for osteoporosis than previously thought. Identifying modifiable health behaviors, such as diet and physical activity, to prevent bone loss is an important public health priority, as adherence to bone medications is generally poor. Increasing evidence suggests that overall dietary quality is critical for bone health; however, studies that use predefined dietary patterns as a measure of overall dietary quality have reported inconsistent associations with bone outcomes. This is likely due to the fact that nutrients and foods known to be important for bone are underrepresented in these existing indices. We, therefore, propose to develop a bone-specific dietary quality index with nationally based data, and to then adapt it to include ethnic (Caribbean Latino) specific food choices related to bone health. Few theory-based interventions have targeted both dietary and physical activity behaviors to promote bone health and none that we know of have focused on overall dietary quality or on Caribbean origin Hispanic adults. This K01 award will provide Dr. Noel with training and research experience in bone health and osteoporosis prevention, health behavior theory, behavioral intervention design, implementation and evaluation, and advanced biostatistics. This training will help Dr. Noel achieve her long-term career goals of becoming a leading independent investigator in nutrition and bone health with expertise in designing and conducting culturally tailored behavioral interventions to improve bone health in diverse populations. Dr. Noel's mentors are highly committed to her career development and future success and will help her build additional knowledge and skills in bone health and intervention research. Dr. Noel's proposed research aims are to: 1) develop a bone-specific dietary quality index that emphasizes specific foods and nutrients known to be important for bone; and to evaluate the effects of a resulting dietary quality score on bone health using national survey data; 2) to adapt the index to include ethnic-specific food choices of Caribbean origin Hispanics, using data from an existing study of Puerto Rican adults, to guide the dietary component of a lifestyle behavior change intervention and; 3) to adapt and pilot test the feasibility and preliminary impact of a theory-based cultural and literacy-tailored intervention to improve dietary and physical activity behaviors among 60 Caribbean origin Hispanic adults. This bone-focused intervention will be modeled after another unique behavioral intervention, which successfully improved dietary quality and other health behaviors in low-income Caribbean Latinos. Innovative strategies, including narrative forms of communication, will be employed to help individuals adopt healthy behaviors. This work will inform a larger scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the behavioral intervention on bone outcomes in Caribbean Hispanics. This has the potential to have significant public health implications for improving bone health and preventing osteoporosis in high-risk, underserved ethnic minority populations."
"9458088","PROJECT SUMMARY The broad goal of this project is to determine the impact of the sleep fragmentation that characterizes menopause-related sleep disturbance on body fat gain in women. Obesity is highly prevalent in midlife and older women, with rates accelerating markedly after age 40, thereby increasing the likelihood of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes after menopause. During the menopause transition, over 50% of women gain body fat, specifically abdominal visceral adipose tissue, unrelated to chronological aging. Estradiol withdrawal is thought to be responsible for these body composition changes. However, withdrawal of estradiol is unlikely to exclusively explain these changes because body fat gains are not uniform despite universal progression to hypo-estrogenism and because body fat accrues during the menopause transition, when estradiol is still produced intermittently. Experienced by almost half of women during the menopause transition, sleep fragmentation related to hot flashes may contribute detrimentally to these body composition changes. In older individuals, age-related reduction in total sleep time and increase in sleep fragmentation are linked with obesity and an adverse adipokine profile. In human and animal models, experimental sleep restriction and fragmentation induce an adverse metabolic biomarker profile linked with body fat gain and obesity, including suppression of leptin, increase of ghrelin, decrease of adiponectin, and increased hunger and caloric intake. However, the impact of sleep fragmentation characterizing the menopause transition on body fat gain and its metabolic biomarkers is not known. While lower estradiol levels and hot flashes, the primary source of sleep disruption in menopause, have been linked with an adverse adipokine profile in epidemiologic studies, the role of the highly prevalent sleep disruption associated with menopause has not been investigated. This proposal will pair an experimental sleep fragmentation paradigm with an experimental estradiol withdrawal paradigm mimicking menopause in healthy female volunteers to investigate the impact of menopause-related sleep disruption on metabolic and behavioral biomarkers of body fat gain. Forty healthy premenopausal women will be randomly assigned to inpatient sleep studies involving 3 uninterrupted nights followed by 3 experimentally fragmented nights, or the reverse order, during 3 sleep periods: 1) when estradiol is high during the mid-to-late follicular phase, 2) when estradiol is suppressed by a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist and hot flashes have not begun, and 3) when estradiol is suppressed and hot flashes have developed. The experimental design will enable the impact of sleep fragmentation (Aim 1), hot flashes (Aim 2), and estradiol withdrawal (Aim 3) on these biomarkers to be isolated from each other. Given the prevalence of sleep disruption during the menopause transition, this proposal will provide pivotal insights into the impact of menopause-related sleep fragmentation, hot flashes, and hormone changes on markers of body fat gain, which will inform health promotion strategies to prevent gains in body fat in midlife women."
"9600321","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex disease with both genetic (G) and environmental (E) risk factors contributing to susceptibility. Genome-wide GxE interaction scans (GWIS) can help identify novel susceptibility loci and biologically meaningful GxE interactions that point to new carcinogenic mechanisms. Limited statistical power remains a primary concern in GxE analyses. To maximize the statistical power in a GWIS, it is essential to have the largest possible sample size by pooling resources across studies. In this project, we will combine the resources of three existing CRC consortia (approximately 53,600 cases and 52,400 controls of European descent): the Colorectal Cancer Family Registry (CCFR), the Colorectal Cancer Transdisciplinary (CORECT) Study, and the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) for interaction testing with 8 environmental and lifestyle factors: alcohol, calcium, folate, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), red meat, processed meat, and smoking. To improve statistical power and enhance our ability to discover true GxE associations, we will as part of Aim 1 incorporate functional genomics data in two forms: (1) enhancer/promoter profiles derived from ChIPseq and DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) data publicly available from Roadmap or from our own experiments in normal colon tissue; and (2) our newly generated RNA-Seq results from normal colon biopsies with detailed environmental and lifestyle risk factor information, and gene expression measured in normal human 3D colon organoids (?mini guts?) in response to environmental exposures. In Aim 2 we will use our novel statistical methods that can incorporate the CR and E-specific functional genomics data generated in Aim 1 to discover new GxE interaction for CRC with rare and common single nucleotide variants (down to MAF 0.1%) in up to 53,600 cases and 52,400 controls. To narrow in on the underlying causal variant(s) for any identified novel GxE interaction, we will conduct fine-mapping analyses using a trans-ethnic meta-analysis (23,500 non-European and 106,000 European). To follow-up on identified significant GxE interactions, we will functionally validate our strongest GxE interactions (including previously published findings) to provide support for the novel GxE interactions such as knock down in CRC cell lines and normal human 3D colon epithelial organoids. Our large and well-characterized study population, combined with our experienced research team, and integration of functional genomics data into our novel statistical methods provide opportunities to better understand how genetic and environmental risk factors, combined, contribute to individual risk of CRC. Discovering GxE interactions will provide insight into the underlying mechanisms that drive gene-CRC associations impacted by established environmental risk factors. Since genetic profiles are fixed, modifying environmental exposures to alter deleterious effects of alleles remains an important preventive strategy."
"9540753","ABSTRACT Stroke is among the top ten causes of death in children but has received disproportionally little attention. The developmental stage of the brain at the stroke onset plays key role in injury mechanisms. In humans, perinatal arterial stroke is frequent but is almost never recurrent, whereas childhood arterial ischemic stroke (CAIS) is less frequent but its recurrence rate is strikingly high. Emerging clinical data show that cerebral arteriopathy is strongly predictive of stroke recurrence and that recent viral infection predisposes to CAIS by sensitizing the vasculature. Leukocytes have been postulated to increase CAIS risk and its recurrence by serving as ultimate mediators of infection-induced cerebral arteriopathies. To understand how viral infection exacerbates CAIS, we established a novel age-appropriate model of childhood arteriopathy induced by viral infection via administration of a Toll-like receptor 3 ligand Poly-I:C in postnatal day 18 (P18) mice. To mimic CAIS, we established a novel age-appropriate childhood stroke model, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in P21 mice. We hypothesize that viral infection-induced arteriopathy exacerbates childhood stroke in myeloid cell- dependent manner. We will examine effects of viral infection at P18 in producing vascular inflammation, arteriopathy and changes leukocyte phenotypes (Aim 1), determine if inhibition of either leukocyte recruitment or neutrophil signaling attenuate infection-induced exacerbation of vascular inflammation and injury after childhood stroke (Aim 2), and determine the role of monocyte Vs. neutrophil signaling in enhancing disrupted brain connectivity after childhood stroke by preceding infection (Aim 3). We will utilize several pharmacological and genetic strategies in vivo to disrupt signaling or abolish trafficking of individual subsets of myeloid cells and use novel tools to examine vascular re-mapping in vivo in relation to changes in brain connectivity and long- term functional outcomes. In vessels isolated from juvenile brains following infection and/or stroke, we will further examine vascular inflammation and modes of endothelial activation. The use of reporter Lys-eGFP-ki mice and reporter mice with defective CCR2-mediated monocyte trafficking will enable visualizing myeloid cells, distinguishing them from brain immune cells, and identifying phenotypic leukocyte changes. Longitudinal multi-modal MRI will non-invasively delineate stroke severity, recurrence and hemorrhagic transformation enhanced by viral infection, and delineate changes in vessel architecture (MR angiography). We will examine effects in males and females because CAIS is more common in boys than in girls and protective role of innate immune receptors may be sex-dependent. Our unique ability to identify how to ameliorate childhood stroke by changing the leukocyte phenotypes following infection-triggered arteriopathy would critically advance the understanding of CAIS and identify new pharmacologic targets."
"9668254","Project Summary/Abstract  Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) in otherwise healthy children, and developing an effective prophylactic vaccine to prevent RSV disease in infants is a public and global health priority according to the World Health Organization. The specific goal of this research project is to generate, characterize, and prioritize, in the laboratory, a pipeline of novel live attenuated RSV vaccine candidates. We will also generate and assess live vaccine candidates against a related virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Our long-term goal is to develop safe and efficacious RSV and hMPV vaccines for immunizing sero-negative infants, who are beyond the reach of protective maternal antibodies, against medically attended RSV and hMPV LRTI. Globally, there are 34 million new RSV infections annually with 3.4 million hospitalizations and 66,000 to 199,000 deaths. It was estimated that in the USA, 2 million children under the age of 5 required care for RSV infections annually and 78% are over the age of one year. hMPV is second to RSV as a major cause of infant LRTI. Vaccinating the birth cohort with a RSV vaccine that induces immunity similar to natural infection has been estimated to significantly reduce RSV hospitalizations and medical costs globally.  A live attenuated vaccine generally mimics natural infection, and therein lays a challenge for RSV. On the one hand, epidemiology and natural history studies demonstrate that natural RSV infection results in protection of infants and children against severe RSV disease upon subsequent infection. On the other hand, natural RSV immunity is not considered robust or long lasting, so heavy attenuation of the natural virus led to poorly immunogenic live vaccines over the years. We recently published a RSV live vaccine candidate that was engineered to be highly attenuated in cotton rats yet retained immunogenicity similar to wild-type virus. Rather than attenuate virus replication per se, we codon-deoptimized or deleted non-essential RSV genes involved in virulence and immune modulation. This results in in vivo attenuation and enhanced immunogenicity. The attenuation phenotype was genetically stable because it is conferred by hundreds of mutations we introduced into the RSV genome. The other distinguishing characteristic is a novel fusion (F) protein that is enriched for the more immunogenic pre-F conformation. This grant expands these initial published findings into a vaccine discovery program to hone in an optimal RSV vaccine candidate and apply the approach to hMPV.  Aims 1 and 2 will develop RSV live attenuated vaccine candidates based on optimizing virulence gene modifications and optimizing the F antigen. In Aim 3, we will utilize our RSV construct platform to generate chimeric RSV-hMPV strains as vaccine candidates against hMPV. The outcome of these studies will establish a new framework of balancing attenuation and potency and prioritize lead candidates for clinical development."
"9482617","SUMMARY R21 Bold Initiative Optical pacing using graphene-cardiomyocyte interfaces for precision medicine and drug discovery The ability to produce cardiomyocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with heart disease creates the unprecedented opportunity to decipher disease mechanisms, predict patient drug responses and develop new drugs that was unimaginable even a few years ago. This is particularly relevant for cardiac rhythm disorders, which cause half of all heart failure deaths and for which clinically relevant phenotypes have been recapitulated by iPSC-cardiomyocyte models. The heart is an electrically excitable tissue; thus, to take full advantage of iPSC-cardiomyocytes, it is imperative to electrically stimulate them to evoke clinically relevant phenotypes and monitor drug effects. Current technologies are either too cumbersome or expensive for widespread use in high throughput applications. Therefore, this proposal is to develop a graphene-based nanotechnology to optically stimulate three-dimensional Engineered Heart Tissues (EHTs) that will be inexpensive and readily implemented in screening and drug discovery settings. Our goal is to develop a new technology that would be: 1) inexpensive, 2) can be adopted in conventional cell culture dishes, 3) does not disrupt the integrity of the cell membrane and ion currents, and 4) does not require genetic manipulation of the cells. We will test the ability of the prototype nanotechnology + EHT platform to measure characteristic responses of benchmark drugs, and to discern disease specific responses using iPSC-cardiomyocytes from patients with normal and rhythm disorders. We will establish a general means of stimulation concomitant with optical recording of physiological parameters. The solution will be broadly applicable to other excitable cells, such as neurons and endocrine cells."
"9472298","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic itch is a presenting sign in numerous diseases associated with the skin, the immune, and the nervous systems. Chronic itch is largely resistant to conventional antihistamines, and few effective therapies are available. We have previously uncovered a small subset of itch- specific neurons which express gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), an itch receptor, in the spinal cord. GRPR+ neurons are required for pruritoceptive but not for nociceptive transmission. We have also begun to elucidate the function of neuromedin B receptor (NMBR), another itch receptor in the spinal cord. Our goal is to investigate fundamental mechanisms of itch transmission. We will take advantage of several unique mouse lines to examine the dorsal horn itch circuitry at the single cell level. Aim 1 will determine neurochemical, anatomic and electrophysiological properties of GRPR neurons. We will examine the neurotransmitter phenotype of GRPR neurons and whether GRPR neurons are projection or interneurons by retrograde labeling. We will also examine electrophysiological properties of GRPR neurons using whole cell patch-clamp recording. Aim 2 will determine the synaptic mechanisms underlying GRP-mediated itch transmission. We will test the hypothesis that GRP-evoked excitation of GRPR neurons is mediated by modulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) and GRP-dependent mechanism is differentially involved in pruritogens-induced pruriceptive transmission. We will also determine the role of glutamatergic input in this process and examine whether nonhistaminergic and histaminergic pruritogen act through GRP and iGluRs. Aim 3 will determine molecular properties and function of itch-sensing neurons in chronic itch condition. We will determine whether ectopic GRPR expression induced in chronic itch condition is dependent on primary GRPR neurons by cell ablation approach. Moreover, we will characterize the electric properties of GRPR neurons in chronic itch condition. Finally, we will examine the role of NMBR neurons in itch sensation using NMB-saporin approach."
"9555410","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT For infants born with a single ventricle heart, the Norwood Stage I operation is a life-saving procedure. This procedure is the first in a three-step pathway that begins to correct a newborn?s circulation by providing flow to both the systemic circulation and pulmonary circulation from the one ventricle. After the surgery however, there is no way to continually monitor the flow that is going to the pulmonary and systemic circulations (cardiac output) to be sure each has adequate flow. The long term objective of this project is to provide the first implantable wireless blood flow monitor for patients after Norwood Stage I Single Ventricle Palliation surgery. The perivascular sensor used for measuring flow/cardiac output will be placed on the right ventricle-pulmonary artery shunt that is created during the surgery. Unlike existing technology, this will be able to provide continuous measurements to identify changes in cardiac output after surgery. This will allow for timely therapy for the patient. Additionally intermittent measurements using an injection of saline with provide information regarding the distribution of blood flow in the heart. Based on preliminary work and the prototype algorithms, this project will begin by developing a sensor system capable of transmitting and recording changes in the ultrasound velocity of blood. The meter component of the system will be made to receive these changes and programmed to automatically produce and display the flow measurements. Animal studies will then be performed on 6 piglets at the Animal Research Facility at Children?s National Medical Center in order to validate the Qp/Qs calculations in a single ventricle animal model. Phase I will end with a preliminary clinical study at Children?s National Medical Center. 4-6 patients will be recruited for a feasibility test of the sensor placement and dilution calculations."
"9505189","ABSTRACT Among its medical complications, type 2 diabetes mellitus in older adults is associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of hip and other low-trauma bone fractures. Paradoxically, this increased risk occurs despite a higher average bone mineral density. This increased fracture risk is likely multifactorial, stemming from metabolic dysfunction that results in both increased falls risk and decreased bone strength. However, fracture risk stratification currently is limited largely to bone density testing and clinical risk tools that do not perform adequately for adults with diabetes. Because bone is both a metabolic and structural tissue, metabolomics and biomechanical analyses would be particularly useful for developing and assessing new measures of fracture risk. The objective of this application is to develop and evaluate radiographic and laboratory biomarkers of fracture risk among older adults with diabetes, utilizing biomechanical and translational measures. The proposed research has the following aims: 1) Determine the association between metabolomic profiles and incident clinical fracture among older adults with diabetes; 2) Compare geometric and biomechanical measures at the femoral neck and intertrochanteric region among older adults with diabetes, with and without hip fracture. This application builds upon the prior published work and clinical expertise of the Principle Investigator, Dr. Richard Lee, and provides him additional research skills to assist with his career development goal of understanding the interaction of chronic medical conditions on the bone health of older adults, focusing on diabetes. Dr. Lee is a dual-trained Geriatrician and Endocrinologist with expertise in metabolic bone disease. The primary training goals of this proposal include the following: 1) Develop laboratory and analytical skills in translational science that will be used in the development and evaluation of clinical biomarkers, including ?omics technologies; 2) Acquire principles and skills in biomechanical engineering and materials science to integrate with clinical and epidemiological analyses. By integrating biomechanical engineering and metabolomics approaches with epidemiologic research to identify new markers of fracture risk, this application addresses a significant source of morbidity and mortality among an increasing proportion of older adults."
"9452871","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sleep and circadian rhythms are increasingly recognized as important determinants of health and functioning. Poor sleep health and misaligned circadian rhythms increase the risk of adverse health outcomes such as depression, cognitive impairment, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and even mortality. However, we know very little about how sleep and circadian disruption lead to health risks later in life. We propose to study retired night shift workers (RNSW) and retired day workers (RDW) >60 years of age as a model to understand the effects of repeated sleep and circadian disruption on sleep, circadian, and cardiometabolic health in later life. Approximately 15% of the US population are retired shiftworkers. In previous studies we have shown that, compared to RDW, RNSW have worse subjective sleep quality; worse polysomnographic sleep; evidence of circadian rhythm abnormalities; and increased rates of diabetes and obesity. Additional new preliminary data with an independent sample suggest that, compared to day workers, older shift workers also have worse outcomes on cardiometabolic risk factors including endothelial dysfunction, poor glucose control, and increased prevalence of the metabolic syndrome. The proposed study will advance these preliminary findings in several important ways: First, we will measure not only PSG sleep, but also the homeostatic regulation of sleep following sleep deprivation; second, we will characterize circadian phase, amplitude, and phase angles using a constant routine laboratory protocol; third, we will use a multi-dimensional approach to assess intermediate markers of cardiometabolic health including metabolic syndrome, brachial artery flow- mediated dilation, and carotid intima-media thickness. We will study 45 RNSW and 45 RDW in an intensive sleep/circadian laboratory protocol, and 80 RNSW and 80 RDW in an assessment of cardiometabolic health. We hypothesize that, compared to RDW, RNSW will show: 1) Reduced sleep efficiency and smaller slope of delta power across NREM sleep; 2) More aberrant values in the phase angle between dim-light melatonin onset and mid-sleep time, and lower melatonin amplitude; and 3) Increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome, decreased flow-mediated dilation, and increased intima-media thickness. Exploratory analyses will evaluate the extent to which these effects are moderated by individual-level variables (race, age, sex, socioeconomic status, shift work exposure variables), and dynamic associations among endothelial function, homeostatic sleep drive, and circadian rhythms. This study is significant because of the prevalence and known health consequences of shift work, coupled with an aging population; plausible based on published literature and preliminary findings; feasible based on previous studies; and innovative because it uses a multimodal assessment of physiological function and regulation in sleep, circadian, and cardiometabolic domains. This study will impact our understanding of the health consequences of shift work, which may point to future intervention and rehabilitation strategies."
"9505042","Project Abstract Cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease (CHD) and myocardial infarction (MI), is the leading cause of death in the United States. Genetic evidence has accumulated that triglyceride levels are a causal risk factor for CHD, beyond an individual's LDL-C. Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) contain cholesterol as well as triglycerides. An unanswered question is whether the cholesterol or the triglyceride content in TRLs drives the causal relationship of plasma TG levels on CHD risk. This application will leverage two longitudinal population-based cohorts: The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). These cohorts represent over 7,000 individuals that have (1) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) lipoprotein profiling with estimates of cholesterol and triglyceride content of TRLs, (2) adjudicated CHD events and subclinical atherosclerosis measures over time, and (3) whole genome sequencing (WGS) data available through the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. WGS provides an avenue for a complete evaluation of all genomic variation (both protein-coding and regulatory) across the allele frequency spectrum, while TRL subspecies provide fine-grained lipoprotein measurements. Aim 1 will harmonize the phenotypic and genotypic data at a central location and predict the joint effect of the cholesterol and triglyceride content of TRLs on CHD risk in FHS and MESA. Aim 2 will identify statistically independent variants associated with TRL subspecies and associate these with risk of CHD. An association analysis will be conducted using standardized lipoprotein profiles to identify genetic variants associated with each TRL subspecies. Measures of significance and annotation will identify the biologically plausible variants in genes (protein-coding) or in regulatory regions of the genome. 95% credible sets of SNPs will be determined to find candidate genes of interest or DNA regulatory regions. The effect of the identified genetic variants on each lipoprotein endo- phenotype will be compared. Finally, the genetic variation associated with lipoprotein subspecies will be associated with risk of CHD. This proposal will dive down a layer of depth in investigating the genetics of lipoproteins, and infer the role of the cholesterol and triglyceride content of the TRLs on risk of CHD. Identifying the genetic markers associated with TRLs subspecies will lead to a better understanding of the atherogenic mechanisms associated with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in the population. Moreover, understanding the role of the triglyceride and cholesterol content that is driving the relationship with CHD is important to development of therapeutics through identifying better targets for therapy."
"9485189","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CADENCE-Adults is an R01 study that will calibrate cadence (steps/min) and intensity in 260 ambulatory adults, 10 men and 10 women for each 5-year age-group category between 21-85 years, effectively covering the adult lifespan. Cadence is one of the temporal-spatial parameters of gait. Cadence multiplied by stride length equals speed. Capture and expression of objectively monitored physical activity in terms of cadence represents an overlooked opportunity to represent free-living patterns of ambulatory intensity. There is merit in being able to translate technological and analytical advances into more accessible terms, especially if public health goals are to be realized. Cadence represents a minimally processed and translatable metric that could be collected and interpreted across objective instruments, including those used in the lab, in the clinic, and in the real world. The primary aim of CADENCE-Adults is to identify objectively observed (video-taped) and manually counted cadence (steps/min) criterion cut points associated with markers of increasing intensity across age groupings. A secondary aim is to compare multiple instruments' abilities to accurately detect criterion values for cadence at different speeds and thus better inform our confidence in comparing this metric across instruments. To achieve these aims, cadence and oxygen uptake data will be collected during a treadmill assessment of incrementally faster paces and also using portable metabolic testing of common free- living activities to test the primary hypothesis: Activity intensity (oxygen uptake) will increase in a linear or nonlinear (curvilinear) fashion as cadence increases such that we will be able to develop statistical models for predicting markers (cut points) of intensity from cadence. We are uniquely positioned at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center to successfully conduct CADENCE-Adults as designed in a 5-year time period. We have conducted pilot testing demonstrating the feasibility of this project, established recruiting methods, and are fully experienced in exercise testing, accelerometry, and management of large complex data sets. We expect that cadence cut points established in CADENCE-Adults will be used both to assess ambulatory intensity, but also to inform program design focused on increasing not only the volume of physical activity (e.g., steps/day) but also its intensity (e.g., cadence) in user-friendly metrics. No similar data exist a this time so the approach described in this application is both innovative and critical to providin a minimally processed and translatable objectively monitored metric with established cut points across the lifespan."
"9546462","PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA) is to create a dynamic and flexible data infrastructure to stimulate health research and advance knowledge as it relates to the gerontological lifecourse. Through the development and delivery of research resources and data services, NACDA alerts researchers to opportunities for secondary data analysis, provides tools to locate and access relevant materials, and enhances the availability of gerontological data. NACDA?s mission directly addresses the focus and expectations of the Archiving and Sharing of Longitudinal Data Resources on Aging (U24) (RFA- AG-17-016); representing a logical extension of the NACDA?s work for the past 35 years and the work of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) for over half a century. To fulfill this mission, NACDA will accomplish four specific goals: 1) Enhance and expand the longitudinal collections maintained by the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging and further develop its user-friendly data archive to support behavioral and social science research on healthy aging by focusing on areas of longitudinal, panel, repeat measure and linked data, and by encouraging researchers to share and archive these data; 2) Advise and assist in the documentation and archiving of data and metadata for researchers who are producing longitudinal, repeat measure and linked data, including guidance in methods that ensure adequate confidentiality review and protection for linked and geo-spatial data; 3) Distribute enhanced data and documentation to researchers in a form that will facilitate their use, do so in an efficient and cost-effective manner by creating products that can be used more effectively than the versions created by the original data producer; and 4) Facilitate secondary analysis by providing user support, access to data, training and consultation. By carefully tracking all aspects of user support requests and data use by the community, we will more effectively identify and target emerging research trends and training needs so we can continue to evolve our programs and support services. We accomplish this through the activities of the project staff under the leadership of established researchers at ICPSR, an advisory council, NIA Project Scientists, and the wide array of NACDA advocates drawn from the broader research community. Collectively, these groups will actively advise NACDA regarding its activities and its acquisition goals and make us a valuable partner for all researchers interested in the preservation, sharing and support of data that informs the aging lifecourse."

"9432447","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tauopathies are currently the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases in our country and represent a public health crisis for our rapidly aging demographic. People living with tauopathy, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau), are afflicted with severe and devastating memory loss. There are few treatments available for people suffering from cognitive decline and there is no cure. Memory impairments in AD are highly correlated with synapse loss in the brain, suggesting that synaptic function is particularly vulnerable and may be the most promising target for a successful therapeutic outcome. However, the pathogenic events that lead to synapse decline in tauopathy are not well understood. The accumulation of tau, a microtubule-associated protein, in the brain is a hallmark of tauopathy that coincides with progressive neurodegeneration. How tau contributes to synaptic decline is unclear. The main objectives of the proposed research are to determine how tau affects synaptic function in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)- derived neurons and to identify tau-dependent mechanisms that modulate synapses. This research will apply cutting-edge techniques including targeted genome editing of iPSCs and NGN2-induced iPSC differentiation into neurons. CRISPR-based genome editing of tauopathy patient derived iPSCs with FTLD-tau mutations will generate isogenic iPSCs with corrected mutations. A wild-type tau iPSC line will also be genetically modified using CRISPR to generate isogenic iPSCs carrying mutations that cause familial FTLD-tau. These iPSC lines will be used to determine how tau affects synaptic function in human neuronal models of FTLD-tau (Aim 1). APEX2-based proximity-dependent biotin labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry analyses will be used to identify tau-dependent mechanisms that promote synaptic dysfunction (Aim 2). Finally, tauopathy patient iPSC- derived neurons will be transplanted into mouse brain to determine how tau alters excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in vivo (Aim 3). Further scientific training will enable the candidate to delineate mechanisms linking pathogenic tau and synaptic toxicity in a human disease model. A team of co-mentors and advisory committee members will provide guidance and support for the candidate's research proposal and career advancement. The vibrant scientific community and abundant resources at the Gladstone Institutes and the University of California, San Francisco will enhance the candidate's training. The short-term goals of the candidate are to 1) acquire additional techniques to investigate tauopathy using human neuronal models 2) acquire leadership, mentoring and networking skills for career advancement 3) obtain funding for research as a junior investigator. The long-term goals of the candidate are to make major contributions in tauopathy research by uncovering how tau triggers pathogenic events that lead to neuronal dysfunction and to establish novel strategies for recovering synaptic function in the brain to treat cognitive decline."
"9454557","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infant Brain and Behavioral Signatures of Later Emerging Risk for Psychopathology Little is known about the trajectories of brain and behavioral development during infancy that anticipate and predict clinically impairing patterns of functioning observed during the preschool years. The prevalence of psychiatric symptomatology in preschool-aged children, combined with the possibility of common initializing pathophysiological events shared across various disorders, converge to highlight the infant and toddler period as uniquely suited for identifying atypical trajectories of brain and behavioral development that anticipate later emerging psychopathology. Characterizing trajectories that deviate from normative patterns of development during this time period may elucidate causal mechanisms of mental illness, mechanisms that subsequently could be targeted for strategic intervention/prevention. The proposed research will combine state-of-the-art neuroimaging technologies developed by the Human Connectome Project with a developmental approach to the NIMH Research Domain Criteria initiative. Longitudinal brain imaging (sMRI/DWI/fcMRI) and behavioral assessment (selected for relevance to later emerging psychopathology and acquired via direct assessment, parent report, and state-of-the art eye tracking procedures) will be conducted on 4 occasions between 3 and 15 months with a 5th assessment at 24 months of age. Dimensional aspects of clinically relevant behaviors will be characterized during a final 6th assessment between 30 and 36 months of age. The contribution of the proposed research is expected to be a comprehensive characterization of longitudinal brain development in the first years of life, coupled with a longitudinal characterization of behavioral constructs selected for their relevance to later emerging psychopathology. This contribution will be significant because the empirical data acquired will anchor a new paradigm of inquiry into the developmental processes that temporally precede the emergence of clinically impairing patterns of functioning, augmenting future efforts focused on strategic prevention of mental illness. The interdisciplinary synthesis that approaches clinical neuroscience or biological psychiatry from a developmental perspective represents an innovative departure from efforts designed to characterize neural signatures of DSM defined disorders examined years after the incipient pathophysiological events. More specifically, mapping trajectories of neural circuit development to behavioral constructs specifically selected for their relevance to later emerging psychopathology (Elison et al., 2013a; Elison et al., 2013b) highlights a novel developmental approach to the RDoC initiative. Indeed, these mappings will be characterized prior to the manifestation of clinically impairing patterns of functioning, and will be used to predict later emerging clinically relevant behaviors. Characterizing developmental signatures of later emerging psychopathology has the potential to alter the landscape of early identification and early intervention/prevention of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9521045","SPERM SAMPLE PREPARATION FOR POINT OF CARE APPLICATIONS Project Summary Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) methods have improved vastly over the last three decades. The development of technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) have enabled pregnancy for couples previously incapable of having their own children. However, despite these advancements in reproductive technologies, there have not been significant developments in instrumentation for standardizing semen sample preparation procedures for intrauterine insemination (IUI). Current clinical semen sample preparation procedures are manual, tedious, slow, prone to human error, and likely harmful to sperm due to excessive centrifugation steps. The labor- and equipment-intensive nature of sperm preparation for IUI precludes many non-specialty OB/GYN clinics from offering this service to patients, and generally limits patient access to larger cities with Andrology laboratories. Significant problems that Nanonc will address with the current proposal are: 1) limited access to fertility care (specifically IUI) due to high costs and the need for trained Andrology personnel and specialized facilities, 2) suboptimal sperm preparation results due to extended protocol times and sperm loss during processing, and 3) risks of laboratory errors inherent in multi-step sperm preparation protocols. Nanonc proposes a system (utilizing microfluidics) for sperm sample preparation that will take in raw ejaculate and output a purified sperm population in an IUI syringe in less than 15 minutes. The IUI syringe will be detachable from the rest of the system. During the 15 minutes, the clinician will not need to perform any actions; as the system will run all of the sample processing steps in an automated fashion. Furthermore, the system will have a footprint of a small desktop printer that is portable to be conveniently placed on a bench in clinical setting. A portable system that performs automated isolation of sperm from ejaculate will revolutionize sperm processing and increase access to sperm sample preparation. Additionally the system will decrease cost, time and skill required to process sperm, and potentially improve outcomes for patients with low sperm counts. By increasing the yield and precision of sperm isolation and concentration techniques, our approach has the potential to offer this exact benefit by specifically providing the opportunity for some patients to try less invasive and less expensive procedures."
"9461049","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI aims to apply his Microsystems Engineering background to the study of hemodialysis treatment for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). To achieve this goal he requires additional training and mentorship in the areas of biomedical engineering, translational medicine, and nephrology (especially Renal Replacement Therapies). This will be accomplished through a combination of coursework, seminars, conferences, and close interaction with the mentor and his multidisciplinary research team as detailed below. All years of the award include participation at journal clubs, seminars, and conferences, but the first two years will include training of a didactic nature. There will be more time in those first two years as the small animal model studies will be less time consuming than those for the large animal model. This award will be used to add more structure to my studies by allowing me to attend courses, seminar series, and conferences. With the planned training and mentorship the PI will lead the research effort to explore and develop hemodialysis devices using ultrathin nanoporous membrane technology. More than 430,000 patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) in the US undergo routine dialysis either in dialysis centers or in their homes. Hemodialysis (HD) treatments account for > 6% of all Medicare spending ($34B), despite the fact that ESRD patients account for less than 1% of the total number of Medicare beneficiaries. This disproportionate impact on the US health care costs is expected to worsen. Home hemodialysis (HHD) is significantly less expensive than in-center dialysis owing to reduced staffing and infrastructure requirements. HHD also enables frequent dialysis on a flexible treatment schedule. The numerous health benefits associated with increasing the frequency of hemodialysis beyond the 3-days-per-week regiment are now well- documented. Despite these economic, health, and quality-of-life incentives for home dialysis, HHD accounts for only 1.5% of all HD treatments. This number should be compared to an estimate that 30% of ESRD patients are candidates for HHD. A major reason for the lack of home adoption is patient and doctor concern over the risk of injury or death during a patient-managed, high flow rate (>300 mL/min) HD session. These facts lead us to draw two conclusions about the future of HD treatments for ESRD. First, both economic and health drivers will push HD therapies away from the traditional center-based treatment model and toward more frequent, patient-managed, dialysis in the home. Second, the rate at which this trend progresses will depend on the simplicity and safety of alternatives to standard in-center HD. The purpose of our proposal is to validate the benefits of a breakthrough membrane technology that we believe can help hastening the adoption of home based HD therapies."

Following this initial success, CTSA2.0 proposes to 1) empower our CTSA hub to play a major role in the clinical and research agenda of the nation, by engaging with regional and national CTSA networks in multi-site studies, expanding our partnership to involve additional NIH, NSF, and industry-funded centers and programs, and identifying and replacing bottlenecks and inefficiencies in our clinical and translational research enterprise with innovative and effective solutions; 2) maximize the translational capability and impact of our CTSA hub and its investigators, through the expanded development of a translational workforce trained in team science, engagement of communities of stakeholders in our communities, catalyzing multi-disciplinary team science using innovative approaches, and delivering efficient and timely services to support the conduct of high quality and safe research; and 3) create a mutual learning ?health-care enterprise-CTSA-eco system? that broadens the range and influence of our translational research engine to involve new health systems and patient stakeholder in generating and testing hypotheses, by completing and operationalizing our Biomedical Informatics Connectome which links clinical data in our health systems to our clinical data warehouse that is accessible to investigators and stakeholders, integrating research into clinical practices of our health systems, and providing the opportunity to every patient to benefit from and contribute to advancing health through participation in translational research. These goals and program relates directly to the NIH mission for the CTSAs ? to remove impediments to the translation of fundamental discoveries into better health for our citizens"
"9468364","This application is for a 5-year continuation of the national longitudinal panel data collections of the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study, an ongoing epidemiological and etiological substance use research and reporting project begun in 1975. In addition to being a basic research study, MTF has become one of the nation's most relied upon sources of information on trends in illicit drug, alcohol, and tobacco use among American adolescents, college students, and adults. This MTF Panel application seeks to continue the follow-up surveys of high school graduates at modal ages 19?30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and now 60. The companion Main grant covers in-school data collections, providing the nationally representative samples of 12th graders for follow up; it also covers data analysis. The Panel and Main components together comprise the integrated MTF study. MTF's broad measurement covers (a) initiation, use, and cessation for over 50 categories and sub-categories of licit and illicit drugs, including symptoms of substance use disorders; (b) attitudes and beliefs about substances, perceived availability, and peer norms; (c) individual risk and protective factors (e.g., depressive affect, pro-social activities); (d) aspects of key social contexts (e.g., home, work), and social role statuses and transitions; (e) health, social, and achievement consequences; and (f) risk and protective behaviors related to the spread of HIV/AIDS. The cohort-sequential longitudinal design permits the measurement and differentiation of three types of change?age, period, and cohort. Each has different determinants, and all three types of change have been shown by MTF to occur for most drugs. Factors that may explain historical trends and cohort differences are also monitored; additional factors come from other data that can be (and have been) combined with MTF data in collaborative efforts. MTF Panel is designed to document the developmental course and consequences of drug use and related attitudes from adolescence through adulthood (ages 18-60), and to determine the individual and contextual characteristics and social role transitions that affect use and related attitudes as well a broad array of adult consequences. Research on risk and protective behaviors for the transmission of HIV/AIDS will be continued and expanded to include adults aged 19-40. All of this work will be extended to new data collection years, cohorts, and ages under this application. Substance use among the nation's current college students and non-college youth will be tracked for another five years, totaling 40 years. The long-term follow-up data will now include age 60 surveys of cohorts who were in high school during historic peaks in teen substance use, especially important for understanding how earlier and ongoing substance use and abuse relates to declining health in middle to older adulthood. Impacts of policy changes will be evaluated, including state-level legalization of marijuana for recreational use. The investigators will complete current experiments on the utility of web-based follow-up survey methods and implement a remote data portal to allow access to MTF data by external researchers. Results will continue to elucidate drug use from adolescence through adulthood?including the use of new drugs and modalities?with important implications for national policy, research, prevention, and treatment agendas. As our nation progresses toward marijuana legalization and as electronic vaporizers gain popularity, the need to understand young through middle adult trends and consequences on health, well-being and work and family life has never been greater."
"9525783","Project Summary This application titled ?Small Molecule Neurotrophin Receptor Ligands to Treat Alzheimer?s Disease? is in response to NIH Drug Discovery for Nervous System Disorders (R21; PAR-16-042). We will determine if small molecule ligands targeted to the TrkB and TrkC neurotrophin (NT) receptors will inhibit fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD. In AD, multiple processes including aging, accumulation of amyloid and pathological forms of tau, and inflammation lead to synaptic dysfunction, decreased dendritic spines, and the eventual loss of synapses and neurons. NTs, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT3), are protein ligands essential for the maintenance and function of neuronal synapses. BDNF and NT3 bind to TrkB and TrkC, respectively, to trigger intracellular signaling pathways that are highly integrated with, and hence situated to oppose, the degenerative signaling in AD. Furthermore, disrupted NT signaling contributes to the development of AD neuropathology and memory deficits. We hypothesize that therapeutically restoring or augmenting TrkB and/or TrkC signaling will counteract neurodegenerative signaling in AD thereby inhibiting hallmark AD pathologies. Our laboratory developed small molecule NT receptor ligands that bind to and activate TrkB or TrkB and TrkC. Previous published studies with the TrkB ligand showed that it entered the brain and was neuroprotective in numerous mouse models of neurodegenerative disorders. Our preliminary results with the TrkB/TrkC ligand showed that it reduced tau pathology, decreased dendritic spine loss, and improved cognition in the A?PPL/S mouse model of AD. These results established small molecule TrkB/C ligands as candidate AD therapeutics. While brain levels of the ligands were sufficient to produce neuroprotective effects when given systemically, favorable brain levels after oral delivery are necessary for drug development. To this end, we developed novel derivatives of these ligands that enter the brain more readily producing higher brain concentrations than the original ligands and have neurotrophic effects similar to that of BDNF. Thus, the proposed research aims to determine if these newly derived small molecule TrkB and TrkB/TrkC ligands will activate their intended receptors and initiate downstream signaling in a dose-dependent manner and prevent memory deficits and psychological disturbances as well as neuropathology in the A?PPL/S mouse model of AD. Targeting TrkB together with TrkC is a novel therapeutic strategy for AD, and, to our knowledge, our laboratory is the only source of a small molecule TrkB/TrkC ligand capable of testing the efficacy of simultaneously targeting these two NT receptors. This approach has the potential for synergistic intracellular signaling, as can occur with Trk receptors, and combatting multi-faceted pathological mechanisms seen in AD."
"9471856","Project Summary / Abstract Neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disability, autism, juvenile intractable seizures, and schizophrenia have high socioeconomic impact, yet poorly understood etiologies. Recent large scale sequencing efforts identified de novo mutations as a major cause of neurodevelopmental disorders. Most de novo mutations arise in the paternal germline to confer a growth advantage to mutant spermatogonia in what has been termed ?selfish spermatogonial selection?. Protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A), one of the major Ser/Thr phosphatases is a known regulator of growth and differentiation and a suspected tumor suppressor. A trimeric enzyme of catalytic (C), scaffolding (A), and variable regulatory subunits (B,B',B''), PP2A can exist in >50 subunit combinations in mammalian cells, presumably with distinct localization, substrates, and regulatory mechanisms. A surge of de novo mutations in PP2A uncovered since 2015 defined two new classes of autosomal-dominant mental retardation. The most common class is caused by recurrent missense mutations in one of the 12 PP2A regulatory subunit genes, PPP2R5D, the product of which, B'? predominates in human testes and brain. The same de novo PPP2R5D mutations cause human overgrowth, a syndrome commonly associated with intellectual disability and autism. This exploratory proposal seeks to identify molecular mechanisms by which recurrent de novo mutations in PPP2R5D (B'?) cause neurodevelopmental disorders. Because some neurodevelopmental disorders are reversible, our results may lead to new pharmacological interventions. Predicated by our published work predating the discovery of PP2A mutations in mental retardation, we hypothesize that de novo mutations in PPP2R5D cause neurodevelopmental disorders by a novel change-of-function mechanism. Specifically, we suggest that basic amino acids introduced into an acidic substrate-binding surface alter PP2A substrate specifity to impair some and favor other dephosphorylation events. This in turn may enhance growth/proliferative signaling pathways over those that mediate cell cycle exit, differentiation, and morphogenesis. To address this hypothesis, the two aims of this proposal will delineate consensus sequences for dephosphorylation by wild-type and mutant PP2A enzymes, identify their cellular substrates by quantitative phosphoproeomics, and uncover phenotypes in cell models of neuronal development. Fundamental insights from this proposal are expected to pave the way for new patient-derived cell models, animal models, diagnostic tests, as well as ultimately for PP2A-targeted therapies of neurodevelopmental disorders.  "
"9520125","PROJECT 4: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although reactive electrophiles are important contributors to states of human health and disease, these molecules are generally overlooked in exposomic investigations. For example, many electrophiles are inherently toxic and carcinogenic because they modify human DNA and proteins, but are too reactive to be measured in blood. One approach for investigating exposures to reactive electrophiles involves measurement of adducts formed from reactions with blood proteins. Human serum albumin (HSA) contains a nucleophilic hotspot (Cys34), which is the major scavenger of reactive oxygen species and other electrophiles that enter the blood from inhalation, ingestion and metabolism. Our laboratory has developed an untargeted assay (`adductomics') for profiling HSA-Cys34 adducts and has compiled a library of over a hundred such adducts detected in human blood. Interestingly, some adducts are specific to particular exposures (e.g., benzene oxide from benzene) while others relate more generally to oxidative stress and dysregulation of metabolic pathways (e.g. Cys34 oxidation products and disulfides of circulating thiols). We hypothesize that this combination of chemical-specific and oxidative-stress adducts in blood establishes patterns or `signatures' of adducts that can be related to subjects' exposures to Superfund contaminants and their interactions with environmental stressors. By profiling HSA adducts in blood from cross sectional studies of populations heavily exposed to three Superfund chemicals (benzene, PAHs & arsenic), we propose to find their adductomic signatures. Then, by targeting these adductomic signatures in archived serum from a large cohort study being conducted by the National Cancer Institute in Shanghai, China, we will investigate contributions of benzene exposure on risks of lymphoid and myeloid cancers and of PAH and arsenic exposures on risks of lung cancer.  Project 4 will directly address Problems 3 & 4 on mixtures/complexity by examining a plethora of adducts associated with exposures to Superfund chemicals and environmental stressors. Since Project 4 will explore the use of adductomic signatures as biomarkers of past exposure in prospective studies of cancers, it also directly addresses Problem 2. Project 4 will provide insights to Project 3 regarding protein modifications and bioactivation pathways, to Project 1 regarding mechanisms by which arsenic causes cancer in humans, either alone or in conjunction with psycho-social stress and obesity, and to Projects 2 and 5 regarding contributions of reactive intermediates to toxicity and degradation."

"9463448","?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been recently accepted as the third member of the gasotransmitter family that includes nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). Due to homologous biological functions to NO, we posit that H2S has a critical role in estrogen-induced uterine vasodilatation. Endogenous H2S is mainly produced by metabolizing L-cysteine via two key enzymes: cystathionine ?-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ?- synthase (CBS). We have obtained compelling data showing that estrogens stimulate CBS but not CSE expression, in ovine uterine artery (UA) endothelium and smooth muscle in vitro and in vivo as well as human UAs. Inhibition of uterine artery endothelial and smooth muscle cell H2S production by a CBS inhibitor attenuated estrogen-stimulated endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activation in UA endothelial cells in vitro and the vasodilatory effects of estrogen on KCl-preconstricted UAs in rats. Thus, in this competitive renewal application we propose to test a novel hypothesis that endogenous H2S production by enhanced CBS expression in UA endothelium and smooth muscle functions as a novel vasodilator for mediating estrogen actions on uterine endothelium via interactions with endothelial eNOS-NO. This conjecture will be tested by four specific aims with comprehensive biochemical, cellular, molecular, physiological, and pharmacological approaches using in vitro cell culture models of UA endothelial and smooth muscle cells and ex vivo studies of various artery samples collected from sheep estrogen replacement therapy models and human UAs associated with different estrogens status from hysterectomy. Aim 1 will determine if estrogens stimulate H2S production via upregulating endothelial and smooth muscle CBS expression in UA but not systemic arteries from animal models ex vivo. Aim 2 will determine the mechanisms by which estrogens utilize to stimulate CBS expression and H2S production in UAEC vs. UASM cells in vitro. Aim 3 will determine if UASM and endothelium-derived H2S functions as a mediator for estrogen activation of the eNOS-NO pathway in endothelial cells. Aim 4 will determine if endogenous H2S mediates vascular reactivity to estrogens in human UAs from hysterectomies of post- and pre-menopausal (both secretory and proliferative phases) as well as late pregnant women. The proposed studies are novel because they are entirely different from the existing literature and they will determine for the first time whether a new vasodilator H2S mediates estrogen-induced uterine vasodilatation and the underlying mechanisms. Thus, data obtained will significantly improve our cellular and molecular understanding of estrogen and uterine blood flow biology; this, in turn, will drive the development of new strategies for combating preeclampsia, intrauterine uterine restriction, and other pregnancy failures. New data obtained will also shed lights on the understanding of the cardiovascular protective effects of estrogens."
"9476887","Project Summary This project consists of two studies involving older adult decision-making that are linked by the common CREATE goal of understanding how older adults make decisions that can significantly impact the quality of their lives in contexts where technology plays a critical role. Study 1's goal is to understand and thus better predict the decisions older adults make with respect to their willingness to adopt technology applications that hold potentially high value in improving their independence and well-being, but which also require expenditure of cognitive effort to adopt. For example, older adults may need to learn a software application to increase their prospects of finding employment or engage in online self-learning activities such as learning a new language. In Study 1, we will recruit 48 participants into 6 focus groups, in English and Spanish, to identify four such applications across three age groups: young-old (65-74), middle-old (75-84), and old-old (85+). We will then test a model containing five facilitators and inhibitors that are predicted, through their interplay and direct influences, to impact the decisions older adults make regarding pursuit of such technologies using 225 participants, 75 from the three age groups. Self-appraisals related to these facilitator/inhibitor variables will also be elicited. Findings from this study will provide valuable insights into theories and guidelines for technology uptake. Study 2 will comprehensively examine the relative roles of six different sources of health information, characterized from most traditional to least traditional (e.g., newspaper, physician advice versus Internet-based guidance, simulated online social network), in influencing the choices that both younger and older people make with regard to both low and high risk healthcare decisions using four healthcare decision making scenarios. Participants will be asked to provide their most preferred decision option from a list of available options, which will be ranked by the research team, including a physician, from best to worst. For each decision problem scenario, participants will also be asked to choose their most preferred source of information from the six sources, and the number of sources they used to support their decision making process. The study will also examine how these choices are impacted by individual characteristics such as age, cognitive abilities, personality, health literacy, numeracy ability, risk attitude, and trust in information source. Study participants will include 50 younger (20-40 years), 50 middle-aged (41-64 years), and 50 older (65+) adults. Findings from this study can be used to help develop a framework for understanding healthcare decision making among older adults. "
"9450551","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Eating disorders are heterogeneous illnesses characterized by aberrant behaviors of extreme dietary restriction, binge eating, and purging. The course often involves adolescent onset, and in more than half of individuals, transition from predominantly restrictive to binge/purge behaviors. The pathophysiology of low- weight eating disorders and mechanisms that underlie restricting vs. binge/purge phenotypes are almost entirely unknown. A critical knowledge gap is the neurobiology underlying the developmental trajectory of these illnesses (e.g. transition from primary restriction to binge eating or purging) Our preliminary data argue for a key role of food motivation pathways involving altered Regulatory (homeostatic) and Positive Valence (reward) systems in low-weight eating disorders. Consistent with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative, the current study leverages the complementary skills of Multiple-PIs, Dr. Misra from Pediatrics, Dr. Lawson from the Neuroendocrine Unit and Dr. Eddy from Psychiatry to address this knowledge gap through examination of homeostatic and hedonic food motivation pathways that we hypothesize underlie the longitudinal course of these key eating disorder behaviors. We hypothesize that (i) adolescents who successfully restrict to maintain low weight will have lower homeostatic and hedonic appetite, fMRI hypoactivation of food motivation pathways, and higher postprandial PYY, oxytocin and CCK secretion; (ii) those most vulnerable to binge eating behavior will have greater hedonic appetite, fMRI hyperactivation of reward regions, higher postprandial ghrelin and lower postprandial leptin and CCK secretion; and (iii) those who develop or persist in purging behavior will exhibit increased postprandial fullness, fMRI hyperactivation of satiety regions, and higher postprandial BDNF. We will test this model by characterizing adolescents with low-weight eating disorders across multiple units of analysis within an RDoC framework using an fMRI paradigm, neuroendocrine assays, behavioral paradigms, and self-report measures. We will then follow these individuals for a year to assess who switches to a binge/purge illness and who maintains restriction. Building on our pilot data in adults with low-weight restrictive eating disorders, we will use a novel food motivation paradigm developed and validated by our team. Mapping the relationship between hallmark eating disorder behaviors (dietary restriction, binge eating, purging) and food motivation pathways across the overarching domains of the Regulatory and Positive Valence Systems in a longitudinal cohort of adolescents with low-weight eating disorders will enable us to understand mechanisms whereby dysregulated homeostatic and hedonic food motivation lead to development of these behaviors. Characterizing the neural circuitry, neuroendocrine, and behavioral features associated with eating disorder behaviors will (i) provide insight into mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these high-mortality illnesses and (ii) allow for identification of future therapeutic targets that impact behavior at a time when eating behaviors are evolving and when intervention may change disease course."

The Core provides a wide range of essential services of high utility via three sub-cores: Pathology (B1), Integrated Microscopy (B2) and RNA In Situ Hybridization (B3), each with a dedicated leader ? Director with or without a Co-Director, staff and equipment; these sub-cores work together to serve DDC investigators by assisting scientists with experimental design, data acquisition and data interpretation. The major services provided by this Core include histology, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, enzyme histochemistry, RNA in situ hybridization, confocal and deconvolution microscopy, super-resolution and high throughput microscopy, transmission, scanning, and immunoelectron microscopy, quantitative morphometry and high content single cell image analysis, laser capture dissection for molecular genetic analyses, and digital imaging for publications. The Core also provides consultation and training in the proper collection, fixation, storage and handling of human and animal tissues. A major benefit of the Core is utilization of information and expertise gained from diverse projects in individual laboratories to enhance the productivity of all. This is accomplished through workshops and meetings of the user groups at which new data, methods, and procedures are presented and their applicability to diverse investigations are demonstrated. This Core has been highly productive and beneficial for members of the TMC DDC, particularly to Pilot and Feasibility (P/F) awardees. During this funding cycle, 48 of the 59 Full Members used this Core. The requests, billing and tracking of services the Core are exclusively handled via the DDC implemented iLab Solutions software. The new or enhanced Core services include triple in situ hybridization, super-resolution microscopy, high throughput microscopy and image analysis. The first accessible super-resolution instrument, the GE Healthcare OMX BLAZE, will be made available to DDC members.

"9471350","Summary  Tendons connect and transfer the force between the muscles and the bone. Their development, growth, and maturation must take place in coordination with that of their neighboring tissues. In adults, tendons are highly prone to injury and have slow and limited healing potential. By gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating tendon biology we will be able to improve the design of regenerative based therapies for tendon injury and disease. Postnatal tendon cell growth and maturation is currently a poorly understood process. Many studies have focused on the changes occurring in the extracellular matrix as the collagen fibrils grow in size. However, few studies have examined the molecular changes taking place in the tendon cells at postnatal stages on a genome-wide level. In this collaborative proposal, we will apply unique and novel techniques to isolate tendon-specific cell populations and elucidate the gene networks and regulatory regions associated with a specific postnatal developmental transition. This transition was identified through our unpublished studies on cell turnover rates during postnatal and adult periods. We found that there is a specific stage at which the cells shift from high to low cycling rates that resemble the adult state of low turnover. At similar stages, we also observe distinct changes in gene expression levels. Interestingly, this transition stage correlates with alterations in regenerative potential reported in previous studies. Based on this, we will perform RNA-seq of postnatal stage tendon cells to identify transcripts that are differentially regulated between active and low cycling states. Candidates will be validated through gene expression analysis in mouse tendon tissues. Second, we will use ATAC-seq to identify genome-wide changes in regulatory control during high and low cell turnover periods. Regulatory regions will be tested using the zebrafish to identify enhancers with activity in tendon tissues. Together, these aims will reveal the gene expression and regulatory landscape changes that occur as the tendon cells transition from high to low cycling periods during tendon cell growth and maturation. These discoveries will enhance our understanding of tendon regulation on a molecular level and would provide new candidate pathways to test in the context of tendon cell growth, maturation and injury repair."
"9658909","Project Summary  Heart failure is the leading cause of mortality in the United States, but the structural mechanisms behind this disease are not well understood, so there are no effective therapies to treat it. A key molecular dysfunction in heart failure involves impaired Ca2+ transport during diastole, usually associated with insufficient calcium pump (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, SERCA) expression and unaltered levels of phospholamban (PLB), an endogenous protein that inhibits SERCA in the heart. Abnormally low SERCA activity due to PLB inhibition is a hallmark of heart failure, so determining the mechanisms for SERCA activation and regulation is urgently needed to understand the molecular basis of the disease, and to design effective approaches to restore SERCA function in the failing heart. These mechanisms are complex, requiring structural changes and interdomain communication pathways that are difficult to determine experimentally. Since complete experimental characterization of these mechanisms is likely to remain an intractable problem, we propose to use molecular modeling and simulations tools to detect mechanisms for SERCA activation and regulation with high spatiotemporal resolution, and to discover of small-molecule SERCA activators. Three Specific Aims will be pursued in this project: (1) Map ligand-induced structural changes associated with SERCA activation. (2) Determine the molecular mechanisms for PLB regulation of SERCA. (3) Perform virtual search of hits that activate SERCA by targeting the SERCA-PLB interface. For this project, we use skeletal SERCA1a as starting point to test our hypotheses because crystal structures have been obtained only for this isoform. The structural results from our studies are directly applicable to cardiac SERCA2a because there are no significant differences in the function of both isoforms, including regulation by PLB. The simulation work will be closely coupled to experiments through collaborations; experimental data will serve to complement the hypotheses tested by our simulations, and the high-resolution predictions from our simulations will provide new hypotheses for experimentalists to test in the lab. This project has great potential for pushing important frontiers in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms for SERCA function in cardiac health and disease, and to advance heart failure therapies through the discovery of SERCA activators."
"9462140","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual motion perception is critical to animals. It guides a wide range of behaviors, from navigation and predator avoidance to mating. This project proposes to dissect a newfound visual motion computation in the fruit fly Drosophila, a model organism with powerful genetic tools that can define the roles of individual neurons in neural computations. With these tools, this research will map out the neurons that compute the new motion signal and the way they compute it. This work is significant for two reasons. First, this new motion computation is a different algorithm from classical motion estimation. Classical estimation is well-described by the Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator (HRC), an influential model that has long guided research on visual motion detection in insects, and whose descendants guide motion perception research in animals from mice to primates. The motion-guided behavior studied here appears to be fundamental, but the motion signal is computed in a qualitatively different way from the HRC model's predictions. This new algorithm and its implementation will add to the suite of potential visual motion detectors. Because of the parallels in visual computations between flies and vertebrates, it is likely that vertebrate visual systems make use of a similar algorithm. Second, animals compute motion at several places in their visual systems, but it remains unclear how the different computations are used. Analysis in the compact fly brain will uncover principles for understanding the larger brains of mammals. In the fly, genetic tools and behavioral measurements can be combined to investigate three questions about its motion detection: How do its two motion systems compute different signals? How do they use overlapping circuitry? And how do they guide different behaviors? These questions lead to three main aims of this research. Aim 1 will characterize the algorithm that computes the new motion signal. Behavioral measurements and targeted visual stimuli will constrain or rule out potential models and provide a mathematical analysis of how this motion estimate is extracted from visual inputs. Aim 2 will identify neurons required for the new motion computation. Genetic tools will be used to silence specific neurons in the visual system in order to identify which neurons are required for the new computation. Aim 3 will measure the functional response properties of visual neurons in the new motion circuit. Measurements of neuron responses to stimuli will show how these neurons combine signals to generate the observed motion signals. On completion, these studies will result in a detailed understanding of the algorithm and the neural mechanisms that implement the new motion computation. The new computation and its interactions with the classical motion detector will provide a template for understanding how multiple motion signals are generated and used by the brain."
"9540673","Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle: Chen, Ridong Abstract The durable clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in a variety of cancers has demonstrated the tremendous potential of tumor immunotherapy. However, current approaches are limited to immunogenic tumors that acquire adaptive resistance. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) immunotherapy can result in remarkable long-term responses in some cancer patients by stimulating the immune response to kill tumor cells. However, current rIL-2 therapy is limited to highly selected patients due to its requirements for high and frequent dosing, which results in severe side effects. Moreover, rIL-2 also activates CD4+ regulatory T cells, which suppress the immune response. To ameliorate the liabilities of the current rIL-2 drug, we have designed a long-acting IL-2 analog that selectively preserves immune response activation (CD8+ T, NK cells), without activating regulatory T cells and endothelial cells; thereby, minimizing immune suppression and vascular leak syndrome. We also propose to optimize combination rIL2 analog treatment plus checkpoint therapy in order to safely and effectively kill tumor cells by simultaneously activating anti-tumor pathways of the immune system and removing inhibitory mechanisms.  In this study, the Specific Aim is to use a syngeneic B16F10 mouse model to determine whether the combination of the proprietary IL-2 analog with checkpoint therapy (PD-1 blockade) is more effective in eradicating tumors without increasing side effects. Our long-term goal is to develop the proprietary IL-2 analog as a safe immunotherapy to cure cancer or extend survival of patients."
