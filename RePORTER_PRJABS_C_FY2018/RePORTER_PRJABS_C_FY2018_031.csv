"9546685","This TRD, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Multinuclear Imaging, has been actively involved in the development and evaluation of in vivo MRS and spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) technology for both protons (1H) and other nuclei from the founding of the CAMRTS P41 Research Resource Center in 1995 to the present. While some of our recent metabolic imaging studies involved a variety of organs including kidney, heart, and liver, our primary effort during the prior funding cycle was on the development of novel methods for measuring brain neurotransmitter levels and neurometabolic processes. Under this competitive renewal, we propose to build upon our successes in brain imaging technology with important refinements needed to translate hyperpolarized 13C MRSI techniques from animal to human applications, improve 1H MRS measures of steady-state neurotransmitter levels, and provide previously unavailable regional measures of neuroenergetic and neurotransmitter cycling rates throughout the human brain. These choices are based on meeting the current and future needs of collaborative projects ?Metabolic Therapy of GBM guided by MRS of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate? (PI: Lawrence Recht, Stanford University), ?1H MRS of GABA, Glu, and Gln? [PI: Brian Wandell, Stanford University), and Neuroimaging of Alcoholism (PI: Adolf Pfefferbaum, SRI International). Specifically, in vivo MRSI offers non-invasive identification, visualization, and quantification of brain biochemical markers and neurotransmitters, the assessment of abnormalities in injured or diseased brain tissue, the longitudinal monitoring of degenerative diseases, and the early evaluation of therapeutic interventions. 1H MRS is able to measure steady-state levels of GABA, glutamate (Glu), and glutamine (Glu), and infusion of 13C labeled substrates permits the measurement of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and neurotransmitter cycling rates. Furthermore, the ongoing development of hyperpolarized agents, i.e., MRIvisible compounds whose magnetization is four orders of magnitude higher than that normally achieved at in vivo temperatures, presents unprecedented opportunities to noninvasively monitor critical dynamic metabolic processes under both normal and pathologic conditions. New MRS technology will be developed in accordance with the following Specific Aims: 1) to develop optimized pulse sequences and hardware for clinical hyperpolarized 13C studies of the human brain and glioma treatment response, 2) to develop improved 1H MRS GABA, Glu, and Gln editing methods to robustly measure steady-state neurotransmitter levels throughout the human brain free from overlapping macromolecular resonances that limit current methods, and 3) to develop indirect-detection 1H-13C techniques to measure TCA and Glu/Gln cycling rates throughout the human brain."
"9460374","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer Genes and Pathways Research in the newly restructured Cancer Genes and Pathways (CGP) program focuses on the study of biologically significant genetic alterations and molecular pathways that underlie cancer development and immune surveillance. The primary goal of this basic science program is to better understand fundamental mechanisms of tumorigenesis and cancer immunology, thereby defining new molecular entities that can be exploited as disease biomarkers and/or innovative anti-cancer therapies. This is accomplished through three overlapping research themes centered on 1) genome organization, regulation and cancer gene expression, 2) cellular proliferation, survival and transformation, and 3) tumor immunosurveillance. Key scientific achievements over the prior funding period include advances in understanding mechanisms of damaged DNA repair and replication, identification and characterization of novel tumor-promoting genetic alterations and cancer gene networks, development of innovative animal models of cancer, and determination of pathways controlling B and T lymphocyte survival and activation. CGP membership includes 54 full and 6 associate members spanning 16 departments (10 basic science, 6 clinical) across 3 colleges. Annual CGP total funding for peer-reviewed research in the last budget year was $10.36 million ($2 NCI funding) and $1.99 million for non-peer-reviewed research projects. CGP members are highly collaborative having authored or co-authored 353 cancer-related peer-reviewed publications in the past 4 years, with 17% (n=59) intra-programmatic, 22% (n=77) inter-programmatic, and 32% (n=113) inter-institutional. 49 manuscripts appeared in high impact journals (Impact Factor >10). Productive intra-/inter-programmatic and multi-institutional groups are leading advances in mature B lineage tumors (myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas) and neuroendocrine tumor research, and making major contributions to other human malignancies including leukemias, breast cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and liver cancers."
"9546681","The purpose of this Technical Research and Development (TR&D) Project is the development and dissemination of technical tools for MR imaging pulse sequence development. This includes RF pulse design, pulse sequence waveform and acquisition design, and image reconstruction algorithms and software. Most of this technology is originally developed in either NIH or industrial supported projects. This TR&D provides the support for the refinement of these technologies, and translation into more general, widely useable toolboxes and software. In addition, data sets are provided, so that other investigators can reproduce the results from the original papers, and directly compare their work to our algorithms. This greatly expands the universe of investigators that can contribute to MR imaging research. The response has been tremendous, with many hundreds to thousands of downloads for each software package. For example, the sparse reconstruction matlab code has been downloaded 1840 times in the last year and half, and the paper describing these algorithms is the most downloaded paper over the last five years in Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, the leading journal for MR imaging research."
"9525411","Throughout a lifetime of an organism synapse addition and elimination is on-going to ensure proper function of neuronal circuits. Growing evidence have revealed complex interactions involving intrinsic and extrinsic factors in synapse refinement with temporal and neuronal-type specificity. Studies using C. elegans have continued to expand the understanding of molecular and genetic pathways with single- synapse resolution. The locomotor circuit consists of several classes of excitatory cholinergic motor neurons and two classes of GABAergic motor neurons, and is a highly tractable system to discover mechanisms underlying synapse formation and refinement. Each neuron forms stereotyped pattern and number of synapses, providing an accurate readout to examine how synapses are dynamically regulated. Moreover, the development of the mature locomotor circuit involves a precisely timed remodeling of the embryonically born GABAergic neurons, known as ?DD synapse remodeling?, in the absence of axonal morphological changes. We developed the first in vivo visualization approach to examine DD synapse remodeling. In our recent studies, we have defined critical roles of microtubule dynamics in promoting cargo and motor interaction in the formation of new synapses in DD remodeling. Our findings underscore the concept that microtubules are not passive tracks but play an active role in cellular signaling. In the specific Aim 1 of this renewal application we will leverage our expertise in genetic pathway dissection with in vivo imaging of microtubule components to dissect the roles of a novel kinase in DD synapse remodeling. In parallel, we have investigated the mechanisms regulating the cholinergic neuron synapses, and have uncovered roles of inter-tissue interaction mediated by a IgSF transmembrane domain protein ZIG-10. Our studies show that ZIG-10 regulates phagocytotic pathway via a SRC kinase in the adjacent non-neuronal tissues. In specific Aim 2, we will tackle the cellular action and the physiological impact of this pathway using innovative technologies. We will further examine how neuronal activity regulates this pathway. In Aim 3, we will investigate the role of a conserved MAGUK protein that may link the ZIG-10 pathway to phospholipid biosynthesis in synapse maintenance. Genetic mutations of homologous molecules in human have been linked to various neurological diseases. Together our findings will provide important insights to the underlying signaling network and advance our knowledge in the understanding of human diseases."
"9558408","The overall goal of this preclinical research program is to develop and evaluate the efficacy of targeted alpha therapy (TAT) using an alpha emitting radiolabeled peptide antagonist which targets the bombesin receptor (BB2r) expressed in human prostate cancer. The research program has four specific technical objectives:  ? Synthesis & Validation of 212Pb-RM2: The goals of this objective are to establish and optimize methods for synthesizing 212Pb-RM2 in high yield and purity starting with 212Pb obtained from commercially available 224Ra/212Pb radionuclide generators. Utilizing automated radiochemistry technology, we are proposing to develop routine SOP's for the efficient production of clinical grade 212Pb-RM2. This will also entail developing procedures for assessing the quality control to assure that the final product meets FDA requirements for pH, sterility, and bacterial endotoxins.  ? Evaluate Efficacy of 212Pb-RM2 In Vitro: We are proposing to assess the utility of 212Pb-RM2 across a panel of human PC cell lines representing the spectrum of androgen dependence/independence as well as a panel of chemotherapy resistant cell lines that are resistant to docetaxel, enzalutamide, and abiraterone. We will be creating several chemotherapy resistant cell lines during the course of this study. We plan to evaluate the effects of TAT on each cell line by assessing cytotoxicity, clonogenicity, DNA damage & repair, apoptosis, cell cycle, and protein expression of the targeted receptor, (BB2r), the androgen receptor (AR), and the most prevalent androgen receptor splice variant in PC,(ARV7).  ? Evaluate Efficacy of 212Pb-RM2 In Vivo: Initially, we will determine in vivo stability of 212Pb-RM2 followed by determination of individual organ, tissue, and tumor radiation dosimetry based on 212Pb-RM2 pharmacokinetic data obtained using prostate cancer xenograft models. We will then proceed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 212Pb-RM2. Employing a series of CRPC xenograft models (flank, tibial, and systemic), we will determine the efficacy of 212Pb-RM2 in controlling and reducing focal and systemic PC growth. Concurrent PET imaging using 68Ga-RM2 will be performed to assess BB2r expression concurrent with BB2r targeted treatment to validate the imaging biomarker as an accurate measure of treatment efficacy.  ? Perform FDA IND Enabling Studies: Data from these studies will be used to prepare a physician sponsored IND for submission to the FDA of the TAT agent, 212Pb-RM2. This objective will be carried out over the course of the funding period and will include obtaining commercially prepared cGMP product, determining internal organ radiation dosimetry, obtaining commercial single species toxicology evaluation data, development and refinement of a standard operating procedure for the routine automated clinical preparation of 212Pb-RM2, and performance of required preparative product scale-up runs to demonstrate that 212Pb-RM2 can be prepared in quantities and purity necessary to meet expected clinical demands."
"9463781","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Career Development Goal/Plan: The long-term goal of the applicant is to contribute to scientific knowledge and improve quality of life for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The overall objective of the applicant is to become an independent physician scientist specializing in pulmonary vascular immunobiology. To achieve this objective, the applicant has designed a career development plan that incorporates the following: a curriculum involving formal classes and other didactic teachings that enhance basic science background, writing skills, and critical analysis; at least 75% protected research time with hands-on laboratory experiences to develop new technical skills; and close mentoring by accomplished physician-scientists to ensure a successful transition into independence. The proposed research project combines the applicant's background in immunology and interest in pulmonary vascular biology and will serve as a platform to develop an independent line of research. Research: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a group of diseases caused by abnormal remodeling and narrowing of small pulmonary arterioles, leading to elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure, right heart failure, severe hypoxia, and eventual death. Even with known treatments, mortality remains high. Better understanding of PAH pathogenesis is needed to identify potential therapeutic targets. Substantial evidence suggests that the infiltration of pulmonary vessels by myeloid cells, such as monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, have a critical role in the development of PAH. However, neither the specific myeloid cell population that infiltrates pulmonary arteries, nor the activity of these cells has been deter- mined. Using chronic hypoxia models of PAH, my preliminary data demonstrates that resident monocytes accumulate around the pulmonary arterioles and promote PAH. My hypothesis is that resident monocytes infiltrate pulmonary vessels and, in response to hypoxic stimuli, initiate inflammatory responses and differentiate into cells with vascular remodeling activity, thereby promoting PAH development. To test this hypothesis, we will take advantage of a novel line of transgenic mice that expresses Cre recombinase specifically in resident monocytes. Using these mice, we have developed models of 1) resident monocyte- specific fluorescent reporters, 2) inducible resident monocyte ablation, and 3) resident monocyte-specific gene knockouts. In Aim 1, we will specifically delete hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), the central hypoxia- sensory molecules, in resident monocytes to determine the role of resident monocytes in sensing hypoxia and PAH pathogenesis. In Aim 2, utilizing our capacity to deplete resident monocytes in vivo, we will determine the contribution of resident monocytes to both the development and progression of this disease. We expect findings from the proposed experiments will improve our insight into monocyte biology, HIF regulation, and role of resident monocytes in PAH pathogenesis."
"9461022","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major function of the skin is to generate a protective barrier that shields us from our environment. This process is mediated by keratinocyte stem cells whose progeny stratify and differentiate, eventually forming an insoluble scaffold of dead cells and cross-linked proteinaceous material. Formation of this barrier is completed during embryonic development and is essential for life.  Although the skin's role in barrier function is well-established, whether the hair follicle also plays a role in this process hs not been studied. In particular, the hair follicle infundibulum is a poorly characterized domain of cells that appears continuous with the skin epithelium. Situated at the mouth of the hair follicle, infundibular cells are multi-layered and exposed to the outer environment. These characteristics suggest both the need and capacity for infundibular cells to form a barrier.  One of the missions of NIAMS is to support research that delves into the causes, treatment, and prevention of skin diseases. This proposal is concordant with that mission since our long-term objective is to characterize infundibular cells during embryonic development, adult homeostasis and disease perturbation. Indeed, a variety of skin disorders, including acne vulgaris, arises specifically at the infundibulum, and in more severe cases may cause rupture of this domain (and, presumably, disrupt barrier function), leading to inflammatory disease. This proposal seeks to shed light on the infundibulum, with an eye towards elucidating the mechanistic causes of acne.  In Specific Aim 1, we will isolate both nascent and adult mouse infundibular cells, and characterize their gene expression patterns by RNA-Sequencing. We will also analyze in detail the movement of these cells as they form the differentiated, suprabasal layers of the infundibulum. Results from this opening Aim will improve our understanding of this domain, and provide tools and markers for use in the subsequent Aims.  In Specific Aim 2, we will test the role of Notch signaling in the infundibulum by disrupting Notch pathway components specifically in the stem cells that give rise to the infundibulum in mice. Importantly, this will enable us to assess whether the hair follicle itself plays a role in barrier function, and may lead to the generation of improved mouse models of acne.  In Specific Aim 3, we will examine whether Notch signaling and differentiation defects underlie acne formation in humans. This will be accomplished by analyzing a panel of markers, both for Notch signaling and the infundibulum, in patients prior to and after acne therapy. These translational studies will complement our basic experiments in mice, and will hopefully provide mechanistic insights into the causes of this disease"

"9468428","Abstract Despite enduring high mental health burden, Pacific Islanders have received minimal research or clinical attention in the US. Due to our poor understanding of the issues surrounding Pacific Islander mental health, engaging Pacific Islanders in mental health services has been very difficult. For example, a Los Angeles County (LAC) Department of Mental Health program targeting Samoans only managed to enroll 4 patients in 2 years even using Samoan community providers. A pilot study of these 11 community providers by the Principal Investigator identified several factors including mental health stigma, poor mental health literacy, and a lack of culturally responsive services as contributing to poor Samoan mental health service engagement. This study draws from the Cultural Determinants of Help-Seeking Model to address this research and clinical gap by conducting focus groups and citizens' panels to obtain public input from 50 Samoans in LAC and 50 Marshallese in Arkansas on their unique mental health perspectives, needs, barriers and facilitators to services, and strategies to overcome these barriers. The citizens' panels will bring together lay public members, present multiple viewpoints about various mental health issues, and have members deliberate and reach a collective decision on these issues. All group materials will be translated into English, Samoan, and Marshallese, and interpreters will be present during the sessions. The groups will be audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed by the Research Team for themes. Numerical data will also be collected about levels of public awareness about mental illness, mental health stigma, acculturation, and underutilization of mental health services from 100 Samoan and 100 Marshallese community members to better understand these possible service barriers. Analyzed data will be used to develop a set of intervention components that are likely to increase service engagement among both Samoans and Marshallese. These components will provide the foundation for a universal service engagement intervention for Pacific Islanders that will be developed and tested in future research. Study findings will be disseminated via presentations and peer-reviewed manuscripts to the Pacific Islander, public mental health, and academic communities."
"9450545","Abstract The goal of this work is to apply novel neuroimaging methods in patients with Moyamoya syndrome to test fundamental hypotheses regarding hemodynamic compensation, stroke history, and symptomatology. Moyamoya disease (MMD) has unknown etiology and is characterized by steno-occlusion of the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries and proximal branches, development of collateral vessels, and a high risk of stroke. Idiopathic MMD is relatively rare, however moyamoya syndrome (MMS), which can arise secondary to Down syndrome, sickle cell disease, atherosclerosis, and radiotherapy shares many phenotypical characteristics as idiopathic MMD, yet is observed much more frequently. Patients with MMS are at high risk for stroke, and compared with atherosclerotic disease where preferred treatment regimens are outlined by recent clinical trial results, optimal MMS therapies are less clear and may comprise medical management and/or surgical revascularization. Owing to the dynamic course of MMS, which includes a wide variation of progressive steno- occlusion, abnormal expression of endothelial growth factors and inflammatory proteins, hemo-metabolic disturbances, intimal vessel wall thickening, and neoangiogensis, there is a pressing clinical need to understand the pathophysiology of these processes, how they relate to symptomatology and stroke incidence, and ultimately may be used to stratify patients for therapy or guide development of novel pharmaceuticals. The critical barrier to achieving this rests with a lack of optimal methods that can be implemented for mapping and surveillance. Here, in adults and children with MMS, we propose to implement new MRI methods developed in our center to test focused hypotheses regarding (Aim 1) relationships between endothelial dysfunction, stroke incidence, and symptomatology; (Aim 2) changes in vessel wall morphology, disease chronicity, and neurological symptoms; and (Aim 3) oxygen extraction fraction response to surgical revascularization therapy. The short-term significance of this work is that it will improve our understanding of the physiological processes that underlie how tissue responds to proximal non-atherosclerotic steno-occlusion and revascularization, which will serve as a prerequisite for utilizing functional neuroimaging to stratify patients with MMS for appropriate therapy. The longer-term goal is to use this information to guide the development of novel pharmaceuticals or early screening procedures that may enable therapies to be titrated to patients prior to irreversible tissue damage. Finally, methods implemented are translatable to other vascular diseases, and findings should have broader relevance for discerning pathophysiological differences between atherosclerotic and non- atherosclerotic hemodynamic compensation mechanisms."
"9598055","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lethal bone metastasis frequently develops in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Critically, the biology of this conditio remains uncertain. Our currently funded Program Project Grant (PPG) focuses on characterizing selected soluble factors, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) secreted by cancer cells and cells in the tumor microenvironment, to develop biomarkers to predict PC progression and treatment response. Our progress during the current funding period includes several patents and the development of multiple antibodies recognizing HSPG fragments for potential commercialization as diagnostic/ prognostic biomarkers. We also humanized a therapeutic antibody against ?2-microglobulin for clinical translation to treat PC bone metastasis. In this competitive renewal application, our long-term redefined goal is to pursue new concepts in the tumor microenvironment that redirect tumor cells toward a metastatic phenotype. These innovations include the discoveries that (1) metastasis can be coordinated by Metastasis Initiating Cells (MICs) (Project 1: Chung), (2) the HSPG perlecan and its degradative products are critical mediators of PC metastasis (Project 2: Farach-Carson); (3) cells with megakaryocyte and/or osteomimetic (MO-mimicry) properties reside in primary tumors and can be altered by stromal factors to metastasize to bone (Project 3: Bhowmick); and (4) epigenetic programming of the PC genome can affect cholesterol and sterol metabolism in a manner that promotes metastasis (Project 4: Freeman). To test these concepts, we will use approaches and resources unique to our team. We showed that MICs can reprogram non-metastatic dormant cells through a feed-forward action involving a RANK-mediated signaling network, provoking them to participate in bone colonization. This novel concept is supported by substantial data from animal models and a unique population of hormone-naïve PC patients with bone metastasis and pathologic specimens collected from patients with known overall survival. We will pursue the underlying biology of how circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) (Project 1- Chung), and endothelial and inflammatory cells (Project 2), are recruited to participate in the metastatic cascade. We propose to develop biomarkers to predict which patients will switch from indolent to aggressive disease. Our long range objectives will be achieved by identifying signaling pathways converging on critical nodes that can be targeted with drugs. Our team has developed a range of state-of-the-art methods and tools, including single cell methods of tumor cell isolation using NanoVelcro microfluidics, whole genome sequencing, quantitative IHC by multiplex quantum dot labeling (mQDL), ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses. We have demonstrated success in 3D culture of human DTCs, tissue recombinants comprised of engineered human and murine cells, and reliable models of human PC bone and soft tissue metastases."
"9460395","The goal of the Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) at the HCCC is to ensure the highest scientific quality of clinical oncology research is conducted at the HCCC. A two-step review process is used. Trial concepts are first reviewed by the disease-specific Multidisciplinary Oncology Groups (MOGs) and the Trial Resource Evaluation Committee (TREC) to assure there is adequate enthusiasm and resources for a concept before extensive effort is placed on development of a full protocol. Once the protocol is developed, it is reviewed by the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC) that rejects, approves, or defers the protocol for further development, and assigns a priority score. The PRMC also monitors accrual to ongoing clinical trials. The PRMC has the authority to close protocols that do not demonstrate scientific progress or that are no longer addressing a scientifically valid question. Studies which have already undergone rigorous peer review at the national level, such as NCI-approved NCTN studies, are reviewed administratively by the PRMC Chair."
"9460383","The Viral Vector Core (VVC) is integrated into multiple cancer projects directed at the study of the disease process, therapy and the pre-clinical development of vaccines. VVC staff is active participants in the development of gene transfer technologies in the cancer field. The interaction with multiple investigators from various disciplines allows for cross-fertilization of ideas, technical advancements, and innovations in vector designs. The VVC's overall objective is to support investigators in the use of gene transfer technologies, including consultation with the PI and staff, development of novel vectors, collaborative testing of vectors generated for function and purity, and finally routine preparation including quality control. VVC staff and investigators are in close contact through all phases of vector design and generation, and the VVC serves as both a research and development facility for gene transfer studies and a service facility for routine vector preparations. As a part of the service the VVC will provide purified and concentrated preparations of recombinant adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, vaccinia, baculovirus and retrovirus (including lentivirus). This facility provides access to standard cell lines, expression plasmids, and stock of recombinant reporter viral vectors. The main responsibilities of the VVC are to: prepare recombinant vectors; perform relevant quality control; disseminate vectors; maintain a database of vector stocks available for use; maintain a database of expression vectors; develop new expression vectors as needed; develop novel methods for vector production; and assist in the design and development of novel vectors. The VVC serves the needs of numerous outside cancer investigators interested in both basic and applied research with gene transfer vectors, and is important for several reasons. First, by keeping abreast of many different gene transfer vectors, approaches, and applications, the scientific expertise of the VVC staff is strengthened. Second, serving a broad scope of users improves and fosters inter-collegiate communication with focused efforts at developing improved vectors and delivery methods. Finally, a continuum of new ideas from both outside and within the university, and through our consultants, insures that the HCCC community has access to, or is aware of, the ?state of the art?."
"9650398","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     BACKGROUND: In primary care, where the majority of prescribing occurs, only 4% to 21% of patients achieve the optimum benefit from their medications. As experts in drug therapy, clinical pharmacists are well-positioned to improve the quality of medication use in VHA primary care. Under the Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) model, however, a single pharmacist is assigned to more than 5,000 patients and cannot possibly review each patient's medication regimen at each visit. Thus, the effort of PACT pharmacists must be targeted to patients for whom the likelihood of benefit is greatest. THE TRIAGE ALGORITHM FOR PACT PHARMACY SERVICES (TAPPS): TAPPS is a novel health informatics tool that we developed to provide PACT pharmacists with concise real-time clinical reports to facilitate decisions about which patients are most likely to benefit from their services. Our approach is consistent with key PACT principles, where pharmacists contribute to team-based care by directly taking responsibility for patient outcomes, practicing at the top of their license, enhancing access, and leveraging health information technology to increase efficiency. TAPPS may be particularly beneficial for rural veterans, as patients engaged in primary care at rural VHA clinics are nearly 50% less likely to receive clinical pharmacy services than patients in primary care at a VHA medical center. RESEARCH PLAN: Aim 1 will test the utility of TAPPS by independently evaluating its 3 key innovations in 3 separate projects involving real-world primary care patients. Aim 2 will determine TAPPS effectiveness using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design. The study will involve 25 PACT pharmacists across 5 medical centers. All pharmacists will begin in the control condition (no access to TAPPS clinical reports) and randomly selected groups of pharmacists will be switched over to the intervention condition (full access to TAPPS reports) in successive 10-week time blocks, such that all pharmacists will be in the intervention condition by the end of the study. Aim 3 will gather qualitative interviews from PACT pharmacists involved in the stepped wedge trial after they have completed their first 10-week block of TAPPS use, with a repeated interview after their third 10-week block. The goal of these interviews is to assess both positive and negative effects of TAPPS on patient care and identify potential barriers to implementation. If TAPPS is proven effective, our findings will be used to make refinements to the TAPPS system and to design a subsequent national implementation study. IMPLICATIONS: TAPPS has the potential for significant impact on the health of veterans by enabling PACT pharmacists to minimize risk for adverse drug events and seek the full benefit of prescription medications. If proven effective, national implementation of TAPPS could affect all VHA primary care patients, with particular benefits for rural veterans. Our experience with TAPPS also has important implications outside VHA, including how medication therapy management services are delivered to Medicare Part D beneficiaries."
"9593821","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression is essential to many aspects of nervous system development, function and plasticity. Among several classes of gene regulatory factors, non-coding RNAs have emerged as a rich potential source of regulatory mechanism in the central nervous system. In particular, microRNAs (miRs) provide sequence-specific control over target mRNA translation and stability that can tune the levels of downstream proteins quite precisely thus improving the stability and robustness of molecular networks. However, comprehensive analysis of miR function within the intact nervous system has been very challenging, leaving open key questions such as: How complex is the miR regulatory landscape for neural circuits that mediate essential behaviors? Are these miRs acting mainly during neural development or are they reused to manage ongoing neural circuit activity and adaptation to stimuli? To what extent are miR mechanisms utilized in many parts of the brain, or do they regulate distinct sets of target genes in different cell types and/or developmental stages? In order to address these questions, we have assembled a team of accomplished investigators prepared to work in unison using multiple robust behavioral and cellular assays as part of an integrated program. Our team includes Drs. David Van Vactor (Harvard Medical School), Leslie Griffith (Brandeis University), Ronald Davis (Scripps Institute), and Dennis Wall (Stanford University), who will each assume responsibility for key components of this joint program. We will use Drosophila as a model organism that offers many sophisticated genetic tools complementary to the innovative tools we will develop. Drosophila has proven to be particularly effective for identification and dissection of cellular and molecular  mechanisms underlying well conserved behaviors. This model is also accessible to a full range of techniques for determining the detailed cellular and physiological phenotypes of mutants in specific pathways, thus offering a system ideal for mapping out miR functions on a comprehensive scale followed by mechanistic dissection that will effectively leverage a wealth of tools and knowledge. Together, we will (i) build and apply new genetic tools, (ii) apply these tools to identify miRs required in multiple neural circuits, (iii) discover the mechanisms and regulatory strategies for miR function in each context, and then (iv) compare each model to distinguish general and specific strategies and examine their conservation. This will be the first analysis of its kind in the nervous system. Our preliminary findings already identify convergence between different circuits that will prioritize our detailed studies of several miRs: miR-13, miR-92, miR-190 and let-7. Preliminary analysis of miR-92 already points to a series of highly conserved downstream genes implicated in both neural circuit development and synaptic plasticity from insects to mammals, providing a set of specific mechanistic hypotheses that we will test in the three model circuits to define the regulatory logic for each validated target."
"9636634","PROJECT SUMMARY Disruption of ocular immune homeostasis in ocular mucosa, which includes the conjunctiva, leads to disease and potential impaired vision. The conjunctiva is a mucosal tissue of the ocular surface that is rich in immune cells. These immune cells can prevent disease by detecting antigen, producing cytokines, and secreting anti- microbials. Inflammatory cells and cytokines within the conjunctiva can regulate the outgrowth and subsequent pathogenesis associated with infectious ocular disease. It has been suggested that the ocular microbiome may augment this process, thus playing a prominent role in ocular disease. Clearly defining how ocular microbiota mediate ocular immunity will be crucial for the development of more effective therapies for ocular diseases. My preliminary data suggest that commensals expand a subset of ?? T cells within ocular mucosa, which facilitate the migration of inflammatory monocytes into ocular mucosa and the release of anti-microbial molecules within the tears. The overall goals of the proposed studies are to define how ocular commensals induce ?? T cells and to determine if this specific interaction truly limits infectious ocular disease. The overall hypothesis is that ocular ?? T cells are generated and maintained by commensals in an antigen-specific manner, which in turn protects the ocular surface from infection by pathogenic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. Rationale for the research planned is such that at its completion, new insights between the ocular microbiome and mucosal immune system will be revealed, which can then be exploited for the alleviation of disease. The K99 PHASE of this plan and Specific Aim 1 will use cell culture and fluorescence microscopy to identify how ocular ?? T cells are stimulated by ocular microbiota. Specific Aim 2 will use in vitro and in vivo techniques to assess whether innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) contribute to the generation and/or maintenance of commensal-directed ?? T cells. Lastly, during the INDEPENDENT R00 PHASE, in Specific Aim 3, I will use an in vivo model of ocular MRSA infection to show whether the described commensal/?? T cell axis protects the ocular environment from pathogenic infection. The training phase of this plan will be conducted mainly in the laboratory of Dr. Rachel Caspi (mentor). TRAINING OBJECTIVES include receiving advanced training in fluorescence microscopy by Dr. Robert Fariss (co-mentor) and the NEI biologic imaging core for the purpose of imaging T cell and antigen presenting cell (APC) interactions in situ and in cell culture. I will also receive training from Dr. Sandip Datta (co-mentor) and his laboratory for the purpose of understanding pathogenesis associated with bacterial infections. Data from the proposed studies will help define how commensal microbiota modulate ocular immunity, which may aid in the treatment of ocular disease while also providing me a foundation for a life-long career as an independent researcher in the field of ocular immunology. "
"9597150","A Brain Circuit Program for Understanding the Sensorimotor Basis of Behavior Abstract The Project team's long-term goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of animal behavior that explicitly incorporates neural processes operating across hierarchical levels ? from circuits that regulate the action of individual muscles to those that regulate behavioral sequences and decisions. Our innovative approach is guided by the notion that different brain regions are not linked within a single neuroanatomical tier, but rather constitute a series of hierarchically nested feedback loops. The effort is organized into four Research Projects, each focusing on a different processing stage related to: (1) muscle action, (2) motor patterns, (3) motion guidance, and (4) behavioral sequences. Demonstrating our commitment to team interaction, these Research Projects are not organized according to PIs laboratories, but rather each constitutes a collaborative multi- laboratory effort. The collective expertise of our research team spans the entire nervous system - from the sensory periphery to the motor periphery and was chosen to include experts in every experimental technique we require (molecular genetics, electrophysiology, optical imaging, biomechanics, quantitative behavioral analysis, control theory, and dynamic network theory). We will exploit mathematical approaches ? control theory and dynamic network theory in particular ? that are best suited to model feedback and the flow of information through and among different processing stages in the brain. The four complimentary and integrated Research Projects will focus on ethologically relevant natural behaviors, with an emphasis on recording methods that interrogate the functions of genetically identified neurons in intact, behaving animals ? a rigorous standard that is designed to have the broadest impact on systems neuroscience. Our research exploits a single, experimentally tractable model system (Drosophila melanogaster), in which we can easily study the functions of genetically identified cell classes in ethologically relevant behaviors. Our experiments emphasize methods that interrogate the functions of neurons in intact, behaving animals, a rigorous standard that is designed to have the broadest impact on systems neuroscience. Our research will be supported by an Instrumentation and Software Resource Core that will develop and support novel devices and software, so that we can continue to employ state-of-the-art experimental techniques and data analysis. Collectively, our research program constitutes a systematic attack on the neural basis of behavior that integrates vertically across phenomenological tiers. The result of our effort will be a new synthesis of how a fully embodied brain works to generate behavior.  "
"9442823","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several lines of evidence link the endogenous neuromodulator kynurenic acid (KYNA), a major metabolite of the essential amino acid tryptophan and antagonist of both a7 nicotinic and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, causally to the cognitive deficits seen in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ): 1) brain and cerebrospinal fluid KYNA levels are increased in SZ; 2) a7 nicotinic and NMDA receptors play critical roles in both neurodevelopment and cognition; 3) in animals, perinatal increases in brain KYNA cause an array of SZ-like abnormalities and vulnerabilities in adulthood; 4) experimental KYNA elevations cause cognitive dysfunctions reminiscent of SZ; 5) brain KYNA metabolism is stimulated by stress and immune stimulation during early development; and 6) first results indicate that inhibitors of KYNA biosynthesis (KAT II inhibitors) show efficacy in animal preparations that are believed to be informative for SZ pathophysiology. The proposed Center is based on three premises: 1) SZ is a complex psychiatric illness in which stress/immune challenges during pregnancy set the stage for the emergence of the disease in vulnerable offspring; 2) Stressful events during development precipitate the early presentation of cognitive impairments in susceptible individuals by disproportionally elevating brain KYNA levels; and 3) Pharmacological reduction of brain KYNA synthesis offers a promising new therapeutic target in SZ, especially for pro-cognitive interventions. Hypotheses derived from these insights and from supportive preliminary results in animals and humans will be tested in two pre-clinical and two clinical projects. All studies will be led by established and highly interactive laboratory-based and clinical faculty, and the host institution has the appropriate infrastructure to embark on this  overarching and highly synergistic translational project. Notably, the planned research strategy fits the Strategic Plan of the NIMH, which calls for a) discoveries of the causes of mental disorders, b) charting of disease trajectories to optimize treatment, and c) the development of new and better therapeutic interventions. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Deficits in cognitive functions are a core symptom of pathology in schizophrenia, a debilitating disorder affecting ~ 1 % of the world population. The proposed Center, organized in four highly complementary and synergistic projects in animals and humans, is designed to provide new insights into the role of the tryptophan metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA) in cognition, and to examine inhibition of KYNA formation as a novel strategy to overcome cognitive impairments."
"9461614","Impairments in attenfion and working memory are core disturbances in schizophrenia. The Central  Hypothesis posits that these arise due to molecular (Project 1) and morphological (Project 2) abnormalifies in  the layer 3 pyramidal cells that that interconnect the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and posterior  parietal cortex (PPC). The goal of Project 5 is use information from the normal properties of PPC-DLPFC  circuitry in monkeys (Projects 3 and 4) to determine how these cellular abnormalifies give rise to cortical  network and cognitive disturbances in medication naive, first-episode psychosis. We will use tasks that rely  to different degrees on 'bottom-up' or 'top-down' processing to determine how activity within and  communicafion between DLPFC and PPC are impaired, whether such disturbances are reflected equally or  differentially in 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' processing, and if cortical oscillations provide signatures for such  local and distributed circuit disturbances. We will employ a mulfimodal imaging approach taking advantage of  the high temporal resolufion of concurrent MEG and EEG (M/EEG) together with the high spafial resolution  of fMRI. M/EEG will evaluate the synchrony of frequency band-specific neural acfivity in local and distributed  circuits, including cross-frequency coordination, through integrated spectral and connectivity approaches.  fMRI will evaluate, with precise and definitive anatomic localization, activity of local and distributed circuits  using regional BOLD and funcfional connectivity approaches. Abnormalities in cortical layer 3 pyramidal cell  function are predicted to have a direct impact on both local and distributed circuit processing. These  abnormalities are refiected in impaired functional connectivity and cortical synchrony within and between  DLPFC and PPC. Our findings will provide novel insights into the local and distributed circuit  pathophysiology underlying executive control disturbances in schizophrenia, providing a systems-level link to  cellular abnormalifies, thereby identifying physiological biomarkers for future novel therapeutic approaches."

"9490325","Diabetes mellitus is a highly significant health problem, affecting more than 25 million people in the United States alone. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetes has benefited immensely from the molecular genetic analysis of the disease both in human and in rodent models. Advances in genomics technologies have enabled investigators in the fields of diabetes and endocrinology to simultaneously analyze the expression levels of thousands of genes, and analyze their epigenetic regulation. During the past grant cycle, we have dramatically expanded the capabilities of our well-utilized Functional Genomics Core to serve the DRC's membership needs. We have acquired four next generation sequencing instruments and established multiple applications, including ChIP-Seq for transcription factor occupancy and histone modifications, exome capture and sequencing, RNA-Seq, microRNA-Seq, HITS-CLIP, ATAC-Seq, and methylome analysis. During the next grant cycle, we will offer an expanded repertoire of next generation sequencing services, including library construction and bioinformatics analysis to the DRC's membership. We have recruited Dr. K.-J. Won, an expert computational biologist, to provide advanced bioinformatics analysis exclusively for DRC members. The Core will interact closely with the other DRC cores, for instance in correlating the phenotypic analysis performed on genetically altered or metabolically challenged mice with their expression profiles, including single cell RNAseq, and epigenetic regulation to greatly enhance the power of each individual analysis. Furthermore, similar assessments of the function of control and diabetic human islets from the same donor by the islet biology and functional genomics core will provide valuable functional information that may be integrated with changes in DNA sequence or genome-wide measurements of epigenetic regulation or gene expression. This core, in conjunction with the others, will help measure and understand the normal and pathologic genetic and epigenetic states of islets, adipose tissue, liver, and other important tissues types as it relates to the development and function of these tissues."

"9471601","SUMMARY Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the principal etiological agent of tuberculosis (TB), infects over one-third of humanity and is now the leading cause of infectious disease mortality by a single pathogen. Mtb requires iron for survival and obtains this essential micronutrient in vivo through the synthesis, secretion, and re-uptake of siderophores or small-molecule iron chelators known as the mycobactins. In preliminary studies using a genetic approach, we have shown mycobactin biosynthesis is essential for Mtb infection in mice. We have synthesized a selective nanomolar inhibitor of mycobactin biosynthesis termed Sal-AMS that targets the enzyme MbtA, responsible for the first and committed biosynthetic step of the mycobactins. The objectives of this application are: 1) to dramatically improve upon the in vivo efficacy of our lead compound Sal-AMS through the optimization of its pharmacokinetic parameters and potency, 2) to more deeply illuminate the mechanism of action and resistance in Mtb, 3) to determine the safety profile and potential drug-drug interactions, and 4) to identify interactive effects with other TB drugs (i.e. synergy). We will accomplish the overall objectives of this application by pursuing three specific aims. In aim 1, we will carry out an iterative structure-based medicinal chemistry program to concurrently optimize pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and whole-cell activity using a combination of approaches including fluorination, structural simplification of the nucleoside, and introduction of conformation constraints into the inhibitor. In aim 2, we will perform biochemical and cellular studies to evaluate enzyme inhibition, target engagement, cellular accumulation, and whole-cell activity against Mtb as well as drug-resistant strains. Generation of resistant strains followed by whole-genome sequencing will be used to characterize potential resistance mechanisms and determine the resistance frequency. Finally, combination studies with various first and second-line TB drugs will be undertaken to assess potential for synergy. In aim 3, the siderophore inhibitors will be assessed in vivo to determine their complete pharmacokinetic parameters with a goal to improve on the volume of distribution (Vd), intrinsic clearance (CL), and bioavailability (F). We will conduct chronic toxicity studies and evaluate compounds against a panel of assays (hERG, CYP inhibition, kinase panel) to ensure safety and selectivity. In vivo efficacy studies will be done using a murine model of TB infection."
"9474482","Use of heart transplantation is limited by severe shortage in donor organ supply, resulting in death of many heart transplantation candidates before a suitable donor heart becomes available.1, 2 In addition to the scarcity of total donor hearts, national transplant data collected by the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations indicates that nationwide approximately 70% of cardiac allografts were rejected for transplantation during 2009?2011. The majority of these hearts were discarded due to stringent acceptance criteria, one of which is the limited acceptable time between procurement and transplantation. This time correlates with progression of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and constrains the acceptable geographic distance between the sites of donor heart explantation and transplantation. Overall, there is an urgent need to develop effective approaches to increase transplantable grafts by improving the numbers of organs which will fulfill acceptance criteria. Amelioration of I/R injury despite prolonged transport times and in organs felt to be potentially marginal will improve preservation of graft function, thus expanding the donor pool and increasing access.  Human adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (hASC) represent a uniquely practical subtype of MSC, due to their abundance, the simplicity of isolation from adipose tissue and their rapid in vitro expansion capacity. We3 and others4 have shown that hASC produce paracrine factors that provide therapeutically beneficial effects in multiple pathological conditions. In the context of myocardial infarction, we have shown that hASC preserve myocardial function, inhibit apoptosis, and stimulate angiogenesis primarily through ASC-secreted factors.5 Moreover, we previously reported that pre-treatment of explanted hearts with hASC improved myocardial functional recovery following acute I/R injury in an ex-vivo heart perfusion system.6 Our preliminary data indicates that pre-ischemic infusion of ASC-derived paracrine factors also improves myocardial function during recovery from cold ischemia, with significant preservation of a normal molecular pattern ?fingerprint? of the myocardial transcriptome, as defined by deep RNA sequencing. These RNASeq experiments specifically indicate that cold ischemia leads to prominent disruption of a set of genes (Arnt/Bmal, Esrra, Per2, Per3, Cry2) governing the circadian clock within the myocardium, which in turn prompts a coordinated increase in transcription directing mitochondrial biogenesis; and that these disruptions are specifically counteracted by hASC factors.  Accordingly, we propose the hypothesis that infusion of hASC-derived factors into the cardiac circulation will ameliorate ischemia/reperfusion-induced functional deterioration of model donor hearts ex vivo as well as of human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes in vitro, by mechanisms mediated by soluble growth factors as well as exosomes, which limit damage to cardiomyocytes by preserving a normal pattern of circadian gene expression and mitigating the induction of deleterious mitochondrial biogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we will employ three specific aims:  Aim 1. Evaluate the protective effect of extracorporeal infusion of human adipose stem cell conditioned medium (ASC-CM), fractions, on normal mouse donor heart preservation during cold static storage.  Aim 2. Identify the specific cellular targets protected by ASC-CM as well as its exosomal and extra- exosomal fractions, using human iPS-derived human cardiomyocytes (iCM), iPS-derived endothelial cells (iEC) cultured individually as well as together using a three-dimensional human ?myocardium-on- a-chip? (MOC) model organ.  Aim 3. Determine the relative roles of selected molecular components of the exosomal and extra- exosomal fractions of ASC-CM in protecting the human iEC and iCM in the MOC organ construct."

"9489304","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project focuses on the role of signal transduction mechanisms in hippocampal neuronal plasticity and memory formation. In the most recent Project Period we have been exploring the role of the TET Dioxygenase family of signal transduction cascades in hippocampal neuronal plasticity and learning, focusing on the mechanisms through which this pathway controls memory-associated gene transcription. We initiated our studies in this area about 10 years ago by determining that epigenetic mechanisms including histone acetylation and DNA Methyltransferase activity are necessary for NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in area CA1. We then transitioned to studies in the behaving animal and discovered that epigenetic mechanisms are activated in the hippocampus with contextual associative conditioning, and that alterations in epigenetic mechanisms are necessary for fear conditioning and for spatial learning. Studies from a wide variety of laboratories have now shown that epigenetic signaling is involved in many forms of synaptic plasticity and learning, in essentially every species that has so far been examined including humans. Moreover, in the last Project Period, we as well as the Tsai lab discovered that TET1 Oxygenase is a controller of active DNA demethylation in the CNS, and that this pathway regulates memory capacity in the behaving animal. Given the clear importance of understanding the roles and regulation of TET Oxygenase-dependent epigenetic mechanisms in neural plasticity and learning, for the next Project Period we propose to continue our investigations into the genomic, epigenomic, and functional targets of TET Oxygenase regulation in the hippocampus. We will pursue the following three Specific Aims: 1: To test the hypothesis that TET1 drives active demethylation at memory-associated genes. 2: To test the prediction that site-specific gene demethylation is sufficient to alter gene expression and regulate memory formation. 3: To test the specific hypothesis that TET1 regulates memory capacity via controlling homeostatic synaptic plasticity and cell-wide excitability in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. By focusing on these important new targets for the TET Oxygenase pathway in hippocampus, we will continue to formulate a comprehensive model of epigenetic regulation of transcription-dependent molecular mechanisms in neuronal plasticity and memory."

"9557637","Project Summary Fulvestrant is the only FDA approved selective estrogen receptor downregulator (SERD) indicated for advanced metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after or during tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment. In July and August, 2017, fulvestrant was approved as a first line endocrine agent for breast cancer patients by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US FDA, respectively. However, the drug is not orally bioavailable; its high-dose monthly regimen of 500 mg as an intramuscular injection had limited drug exposure and ER turnover in patients. The low bioavailability of fulvestrant and its slow action presents clinical challenges because endocrine-resistant tumors require a significantly higher SERD exposure which is insufficient in the fulvestrant treatment. As a result, the clinical response rate to fulvestrant in the advanced metastatic setting remains below 20%. In the first line setting, an oral SERD with greater drug exposure and faster action would bring immediate clinical benefits to patients in numbers that far exceed those who are treated with fulvestrant only as a second line regimen. Thus, an urgent need exists for an orally bioavailable SERD that offers first-line therapy advantages over other endocrine regimens and higher clinical response rates in the second-line setting or beyond. Advances in oral SERDs development have been so far confined to nonsteroidal molecules, and all non-steroidal SERD candidates have yet to be advanced to phase II clinical trials. Zenopharm's lead compound, ZB716, will be the first oral steroidal SERD to enter clinical trials if we are successful in securing the funds to complete the proposed IND-enabling studies. ZB716 has shown promising preclinical data in bioavailability, efficacy, and toxicology. If clinically proven, ZB716 will bring substantial clinical benefits to advanced, metastatic breast cancer patients both as a first-line endocrine therapy and as ER-targeting treatment for recurring diseases after SERM and/or AI therapy. To bring this promising oral SERD candidate to clinical trials we propose to complete remaining FDA required studies both in the CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control) and Toxicology category. In Specific Aim 1, Zenopharm will collaborate with Avista Pharma Solutions, a GMP manufacturer on a fee for service basis to optimize process scale up and manufacture 500 g of the API for GLP toxicity studies, and prepare 1 kg GMP batch of API for clinical studies. In Specific Aim 2, Zenopharm will collaborate with Covance to implement the nonclinical development plan following the ICH S9 guidance for the Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals. The IND-enabling studies will be conducted to ensure approval for the First in Human study and support the confirmation clinical Proof of Concept study. Completion of the above proposed work will allow Zenopharm to prepare and file an IND application for ZB716 to be tested in the clinic for safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic studies. It will also enable the company to secure funds from venture capital firms to conduct the phase 1 clinical trial."
"9650536","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The VA has invested hugely in electronic medical records and has achieved a nationwide system that collects medical information from all patients. Currently, the textual information in the medical records is inaccessible to all but a small number of researchers. In order to obtain the highest value from this existing system, administrators and practitioners need to be able to access the textual information they need. It is our responsibility to get the most benefit from thi resource for biomedical and patient care. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) is an important part the solution.  The value of NLP has been recognized in the biomedical domain. Evidence of this includes funding for the following national initiatives focused on clinical NLP: Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), Consortium for Health Informatics Research (CHIR), VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI), Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP), and electronic Medical Records & Genomics (eMERGE). On the one hand, these efforts testify to the demand for NLP research. They have produced new NLP tools, created annotated datasets, developed common data models, shared semantic labels, and even piloted a prototype software ecosystem. On the other hand, the general consensus in the informatics community is that processing and utilizing textual data remains challenging due to lack of interoperability and collaboration. Unless the pace of research and development is accelerated in clinical NLP, we cannot meet the increasing NLP demand originated from the biomedical and health services research community.  Although synergistic development has the promise of advancing the science of NLP and accelerating the pace of NLP tool production, there lacks a vibrant collaborative environment attracting participation of a significant number of clinical NLP developers and researchers. Within the VA CHIR and VINCI efforts, we have created a prototype NLP ecosystem called V3NLP that supports the interoperability and integration of heterogeneous tools into VA research and operational initiatives. The environment needed to foster collaboration and a critical mass of users, however, is lacking. In the proposed project, we will study the needs of existing and potential users of the V3NLP ecosystem to increase its utility and ease of adoption and to facilitate collaboration.  The ultimate goal of an NLP ecosystem is to produce new and more accurate NLP methods for clinical text.  This requires a good understanding of the characteristics of various types of clinical text and the strengths and weakness of existing methods. Because most clinical NLP solutions have been driven by individual use cases and note collections, the resultant solutions are optimized for the characteristics of the specific NLP tasks and text corpora analyzed. Since there are numerous tasks and corpora, clinical NLP solutions tend to be difficult to re-use, especially by different developers. To remedy this, we will research characteristics of a very large and heterogeneous collection of VA text records to understand and model sublanguages in VA clinical notes. This systematic and comprehensive sublanguage analysis will play a critical role in the proposed ecosystem. It will guide the development of new clinical NLP methods as well as the customization of existing solutions.  Our general goal is to accelerate clinical NLP research and development. The specific aims are as follows:  (1) Collect and analyze the needs of NLP developers, health informatics researchers and health services researchers to inform the design of a collaborative NLP ecosystem that will facilitate development of more accurate methods.  (2) Design and implement a clinical NLP ecosystem that fosters collaboration and accelerates research and adoption of accurate and generalizable NLP methods.  (3) Conduct a comprehensive sublanguage analysis to guide the creation of adaptable NLP tools and methods based on VA text notes to support text processing and information extraction across multiple clinical domains."
"9652301","RFA-AT-11-001; Mechanistic Research on CAM Natural Products (R01) Title: Rapid Identification of Active Agents and Metabolomics of Botanical Supplements Summary: This application addresses the unmet need for high-throughput methods to identify active components inbotanical dietary supplements and to determine their mechanisms of action through metabolomics studies. Ultrafiltration mass spectrometry (PUF-MS), which was invented in this laboratory, is more efficient than conventional bioassay-guided fractionation for the screening, characterization, isolation, and identification of pharmacologically significant ligands contained in botanical dietary supplements or other natural product mixtures. We propose to enhance the productivity of this technology 100-fold using a new ultrafast PUF-MS (UPUF-MS) approach and to develop new validated assays for the standardization of botanical dietary supplements based on UHPLC-MS-MS that are at least 10-fold faster than previously possible. We will incorporate UHPLC-MS into metabolomics studies of archived serum and urine samples from clinical trials of the effects of botanical dietary supplements black cohosh, red clover, hops, Prempro, and placebo on hot flashes in menopausal women. It is our hypothesis that this metabolomics approach will facilitate the discovery of biomarkers indicative of vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats. Then, these biomarkers may be used for the objective, quantitative determination of the effects of botanical dietary supplements on hot flashes instead of relying on subjective self reporting of hot flashes by subjects in clinical trials. Overall, these studies will address the central hypothesis that botanical dietary supplements contain pharmacologically active compounds that can be identified using UPUF-MS, used for chemical standardization with UHPLC-MS-MS and that the in vivo effects of these active constituents can be detected using UHPLC-MS-MS in combination with metabolomics."
"9452109","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Timing-dependent dopamine (DA) release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been critically implicated in emotion-cognition interaction as well as reward-associated learning. A shift in the timing of DA release in the NAc has been shown to accompany different stages of reward conditioning. However, despite its apparent physiological significance, the cellular mechanisms by which timing-contingent DA release regulates NAc synaptic transmission have not been directly assessed. To address this knowledge gap, this application focuses on the excitatory synaptic input from the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh), a key brain site involved in the integration and expression of emotional and motivational behaviors. Our preliminary results show that mPFC-to-NAcSh synaptic transmission undergoes long-term potentiation (LTP) by synchronized dopamine signaling from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Our central hypothesis is that this LTP is DA timing-dependent and glutamate pathway-specific; it is achieved by augmented presynaptic glutamate release, and is regulated by co-activation of presynaptic dopamine and GABA receptors. To test this hypothesis, we will use whole-cell patch-clamp techniques combined with pharmacological, optogenetic, and viral-mediated gene transfer to determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie this novel form of LTP. Results from the proposed experiments will advance our knowledge of timing-dependent DA action in regulating synaptic plasticity, provide a mechanistic understanding of the mPFC-VTA-NAcSh circuitry mechanisms underlying emotion-cognition interactions, and identify molecular targets for the clinical corrections of certain cognitive, psychological, and psychiatric disorders."
"9461607","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional outcome in individuals with schizophrenia and related disorders is primarily determined by the degree of impairment in certain core cognitive abilities. For example, subjects with schizophrenia exhibit deficits in visual working memory and attention, and altered patterns of cortical activity during tasks that tap these abilities. These patterns of activity depend on the proper temporal firing of neurons distributed across a network that includes primary visual (VI), posterior parietal (PPC) and dorsolateral prefrontal DLPFC) cortices. These findings highlight an unanswered critical question: What are the cortical cellular, circuitry and connectivity bases for the impairments in visual working memory and attention in schizophrenia? To answer this question, the complementary studies in the proposed Center are designed to test the following Central Hypothesis: Intrinsic molecular disturbances in layer 3 pyramidal cells of the neocortex give rise to morphological abnormalities in these neurons. The severity of this cellular pathology is moderated across cortical regions as a function of normal regional differences in the properties of layer 3 pyramidal cells. This cellulr pathology alters cortical circuitry within and between regions, impairs functional connectivity across regions, and results in disturbances in both bottom up and top down processes during visual working memory and attention in individuals with schizophrenia. The five inter-related projects (P) of the proposed Center provide convergent tests of this hypothesis at the molecular, cellular, laminar and local circuitry levels in postmortem human brain (P1&P2), and at the regional and distributed circuitry levels through imaging and neurophysiological studies in never-medicated subjects with a first-episode of psychosis (P5); these studies are both informed and constrained by parallel studies in monkeys (P3&P4). A key innovation of this approach is the integration of studies with multiple levels of resolution, from molecules to behavior, that provide a translational assessment of both bottom up and top down explanations of cortical dysfunction in schizophrenia. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed studies have high clinical relevance as the combination of molecular-cellular-circuit level analyses with in vivo indices of brain function offers a platform for subsequent identification of novel, pathologically-based targets for therapeutic interventions that are accompanied by pathophysiologically informed biomarkers that can be used to predict and monitor the efficacy of such interventions."
"9452745","Limited English proficient (LEP) patients who struggle to understand their care providers report difficulty navigating both administrative and clinical procedures, leading to poorer outcomes than their English-proficient counterparts. Despite numerous federal and state mandates requiring adequate language assistance, healthcare organizations have had limited success in implementing appropriate services. Facing a shortage of certified medical interpreters, hospitals frequently utilize ad hoc or ?dual role? interpreters, many of whom are bilingual staff with self-reported medical fluency. While convenient and sometimes unavoidable, such ad hoc interpreters are more likely to make critical translation errors that can potentially lead to preventable clinical complications; in fact, it has been found that 20% of dual role interpreters are unfit to perform medical interpretation. Despite the increasing reliance on personnel with self-reported bilingual fluency to deliver critical health information to vulnerable patient populations, there is no rigorous and scalable method for assessing bilingual communicative competence in healthcare. This deficit not only renders improvements upon language services difficult, but also deprives qualified bilingual personnel the due recognition and career-advancing credentials they deserve for their skills. This Topical Assessment of Language Knowledge (TALK) initiative aims to deliver a comprehensive support ecosystem for the bilingual healthcare workforce, consisting of a medical bilingual proficiency exam, a scorer workflow management portal, and a searchable directory of credentialed bilingual healthcare personnel. Further, based on proficiency exam results, TALK will offer recommendations for additional language training matched to a test-taker's areas of weakness, creating a mechanism for continued improvement of their valuable skillset. This systematic approach will provide the necessary support for fostering standardization, increased transparency, and quality assurance in instances of bilingual medical communication. The effectiveness of this approach will be evaluated through implementation with administrators, healthcare workers, assessment test scorers, and other pertinent stakeholders."
"9463462","Pilot Project Program Abstract The Pilot Project Program is a key component of the Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) and is aimed at funding new directions in environmental health research. Emphasis is placed on funding studies by Young Investigators, studies that will develop new technologies or advances that may benefit other CEET investigators, studies that can generate pilot-data for multi-investigator initiatives, and studies that will take the CEET in new-directions. The Pilot Project Program has established a Mentored Scientist Transition Award (MSTA) which is the center's primary mechanism for funding Young Investigators in the Career Development Core so that they can gain independent grant funding. The Pilot Project Program also encourages applications that will seed patient and population-based research that will use the resources of the Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC) or the Translational Biomarker Core (TBC). A unique feature of the Pilot Project Program is to fund inter-EHS CC pilot projects when Center investigators and investigators from partnering Centers would benefit from each other in terms of complementary scientific expertise to address an important environmental health question. The aims of the Pilot project program are to: (i) support career development of Young Investigators in environmental health science through the Mentored Scientist Transition Award; (ii) attract established investigators into environmental health science; (iii) develop technologies that may benefit other CEET investigators; (iv) fund collaborative research that may lead to multi-investigator grant applications; (v) stimulate interdisciplinary research themes in environmental health science; (vi) fund community based research projects identified by COEC members; (vii) fund patient and population based exposure research that will utilize the IHSFC; and (viii) fund inter-EHS CC pilot projects to build teams across the Center Program. These aims are accomplished by funding pilot-projects in one of four categories: Mentored Scientist Transition Award; Opportunity Award (any faculty member with a relevant environmental health science question); Focused Awards (co-sponsored in the next cycle by institutional funds to support epigenetics and children's environmental health research); and inter-EHS CC pilots. In the last funding cycle we received 57 applications, funded 25 of which 15 went to Young Investigators which resulted in 17-fold return on investment in terms of grant support. We also funded two inter-EHS CC pilot projects."
"9645779","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The Biostatistics, Bioinformatics & Computational Biology Core (BBCB; Core E) will assist CFAR members with the management, analysis, modeling and annotation of complex and massive data generated by laboratory and clinical studies. The overall objective will be to provide a comprehensive solution that integrates expertise and resources in biostatistics, bioinformatics, computation, mathematical modeling and data management.    Since its inception in 2010, Core E has developed and refined an innovative approach to optimally address investigator needs. This combines an integrated service model (one stop shopping) with an  active and novel outreach strategy. Thus, rather than taking a traditional approach, in which requests for  data analysis services are often initiated too late (after data are already generated, when one can no  longer modify study design). Core E proactively engages with researchers. It does so by assigning core  members to attend lab meetings (house calls) and to assist at the very earliest stages of study planning.  Building on this innovative approach, five Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will provide biostatistics support  for experimental design and data analysis. Aim 2 will provide bioinformatics and computational biology  support, and will also promote interdisciplinary collaborations by supporting new applications of  computationally-intensive methods to HIV/AIDS research (e.g., analyses of imaging data for our CNS  Reservoirs/Aging SWG, and structural modeling for our RNA Biology SWG). Aim 3 will provide data  management and informatics services, and Aim 4 will provide education and training services. Finally,  Aim 5 will leverage other available resources (including methodological research grants/projects and  institutional support) to create novel statistical, computational, modeling and bioinformatics tools for  HIV/AIDS research."

"9442827","Schizophrenia pathology has long been associated with stress and/or immunity, although their etiological  paths to the disease are far from clear. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation is a strong  candidate for the missing link because enzymes that gate the first step of the conversion of tryptophan to  kynurenine are influenced by stress, glucocorticoids and the immune system. However, the downstream  mechanisms connecting increased kynurenine synthesis and pathological events in schizophrenia involve  multiple chemical changes, which are not necessarily identical in the periphery and in the brain. In other  words, in spite of the attractiveness and plausibility of the hypothetical link between kynurenine pathway  metabolism and schizophrenia, and especially the presumed prominent etiological role of the pathway  metabolite kynurenic acid, the field lacks a coherent explanatory model, hindering meaningful pre-clinical-  clinical translations. The difficulty may be due to the inherent complexity of the system and its interactions  with other systems, but also to the lack of a comprehensive clinical effort to understand the connection  between the kynurenine pathway and the core features of schizophrenia patients. The present effort is  designed to change that by examining the impact of stress and cytokine mechanisms on kynurenine pathway  metabolites in schizophrenia patients, and by evaluating the relevance of these new findings to  pathophysiology. Based on the strong pre-clinical evidence for causality and embracing the complexity of  the system, the project is designed to test the trajectory from stress/cytokines to kynurenine pathway  metabolites to clinical and brain abnormalities in schizophrenia using an array of state-of-the-art imaging,  electrophysiology, and modeling approaches. This study will therefore comprehensively investigate the  extent of the involvement of the kynurenine pathway in mediating the effects of stress and immune function  on core clinical and biological abnormalities in schizophrenia, and define the key biomarkers associated with  the kynurenine pathway in schizophrenia. This new knowledge regarding the involvement of kynurenine  pathway metabolism in schizophrenia patients will lead to more specific and better treatment targets for drug  development."
"9438910","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetically-encoded technologies that enable the construction of systems that receive, process, and transmit molecular information are essential to advancing basic biological research, applied biomedical research, and biotechnology. RNA switches are a class of ligand-responsive genetic controllers that are being implemented in diverse biological systems to transform our ability to monitor, interface with, and program the dynamic cellular state. While the application of synthetic regulatory RNAs has grown remarkably over the past decade, current approaches to the design of new RNA regulatory elements are inefficient, laborious, and typically do not yield insight into the sequence-structure-function relationships underlying the activities of these molecules in complex biological systems. The goal of the proposed project is to develop new strategies for approaching the measurement, analysis, and design of an important class of RNA switches that incorporate ribozymes as the gene-control element. The goal of the project will be achieved through three specific aims. The first specific aim will focus on developing and validating new data-rich, massively-parallel measurement strategies that leverage next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assays to obtain gene-regulatory and cleavage activity information on millions of RNA switch sequences in a single experiment. The second specific aim will focus on developing new computational methods to perform analyses of large NGS datasets on RNA switch activities to gain and apply new insight into the sequence-structure-function relationships of functional RNA molecules. The third specific aim will apply these new measurement and analysis methods to specific libraries and cellular systems to advance our understanding of the sequence-activity landscape of RNA switches.  The successful execution of the project will transform our capacity to rapidly and reliably build these genetic tools for diverse biological systems. In addition, the rich datasets generated through the newly developed methods will be leveraged to uncover new insight into the sequence-activity landscapes underlying this important class of functional RNA molecules and answer long-standing questions in the field. These insights will more broadly advance our understanding of RNA sequence-structure-function relationships and ultimately dramatically improve our capacities for rational design of functional RNA molecules. The assay and analysis methods developed through this project will change the paradigm by which the research community approaches functional RNA design, thereby having a substantially broader impact on the field."
"9517097","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human civilizations are hallmarked by communicating magnitude, time, and space in the form of numeral symbols. Humans learn to speak a certain language and read its symbols depending on the culture they live in. All brains are known to have specialized group of neuronal populations in the visual system that, through education and culture, are pruned to recognize these visual symbols, and be able to feed them to specific networks of the brain where they are processed. The existence of neuronal populations in the brain's visual system to respond selectively to numerals is a fascinating example of how nurture affects our nature, i.e., how cultural experience and education change the brain's biological function. Yet, relatively little is known about the way these specialized populations of neurons operate in the visual system and with the networks of language and numerosity. The proposed work will be the first multimodal approach to combine direct recordings from the surface of the human brain (electrocorticography, ECoG) as well as causing reversible functional perturbations by electrical brain stimulation (EBS). The proposed work aims to provide a comprehensive map of the location and functional properties and connectivity of the specialized areas of the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) for numerals (i.e., visual numeral area (VNA). Lastly, we propose to study how the neuronal population activities change in the VTC when human subjects learn to associate foreign symbols with their categorical and semantic identities. We are hopeful and confident that our novel multimodal approach will provide unprecedented spatiotemporal information to clarify the outstanding questions about the functional contributions of VTC subregions to how numbers are processed in the human brain."

Core services derive from the broad  expertise of Core investigators, encompassing studies in clinical physiology, clinical trials involving diabetes  and obesity as well as patient-centered outcomes research, thus spanning the spectrum of translational  research. The unique strengths of our TRC position us to promote the continued growth of diabetes-related  translational research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Einstein) and to expand our reach to include  the expertise of diabetes investigators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (Mount Sinai) and other  regional partners. We provide resources for diabetes research via faculty consultation and collaborative efforts  for other programs and projects. Importantly, the TRC also leverages resources of the recently renewed  Einstein Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA, known as the Institute for Clinical and Translational  Research, ICTR) and the Mount Sinai Institutes for Translational Sciences (Conduits). Further, the TRC also  receives substantial Institutional support, which further extends our reach and capabilities. The Einstein and  Mount Sinai CTSAs provide critical research infrastructure and facilitate access to other institutionally  sponsored services, while the TRC in partnership with the CTSAs will focus specifically on support of the  unique diabetes, obesity and metabolism research needs. We view the CTSA programs as an important  partner in our efforts and have developed this Core to fill critical gaps in the resources needed to promote the  broad range of diabetes clinical and translational research. The TRC therefore has the following specific aims:  1) To facilitate the development of novel diabetes-related ?T1? translational research programs based upon  novel collaborations between basic scientists and `translational' researchers; 2) To provide specialized  expertise in the design and implementation of diabetes ?T2-T3? research programs; and 3) To provide  consultation, infrastructure and training to build capacity for diabetes community-based (?T4?) research at the  local, regional and national levels."
"9475212","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In patients with very-late-stage non-dialysis dependent (NDD) CKD (eGFR <25 ml/min/1.73 m2) the optimal transition of care to renal replacement therapy (RRT, i.e., dialysis or transplantation) is not known. Major uncertainty and significant knowledge gaps have persisted pertaining to differential or individualized transitions of care across different age and demographics and different pre-RRT comorbid conditions and events in several key areas including:  (1) the best timing for RRT initiation; (2) the optimal RRT type (dialysis vs. transplant); and in the case of dialysis, the best modality (hemo- vs. peritoneal), format (in-center vs. home), frequency (daily vs. infrequent) and vascular access preparation; (3) the post-RRT impact of pre-RRT comorbid conditions and events including blood pressure and glycemic control, acute kidney injury episodes, and management of CKD specific conditions such as anemia and mineral disorders; and (4) the impact of the above pre-RRT conditions on end-of-life care and decision-making. Given the enormous changes occurring in our health care system and given the high costs of dialysis therapy with persistently poor outcomes, there is an urgent need to answer these important questions related to CKD transitions to RRT.  Given the inherent limitations of the USRDS that lacks most core data prior to the RRT transition intercept, we propose a highly innovative linkage approach between the USRDS and two exceptionally rich and large longitudinal databases of very-late-stage NDD-CKD patients, i.e., the national (entire US) Veterans Affairs (VA) database and the regional (Southern California) Kaiser Permanente (KPSC) database, each consisting of millions of people including over 20,000 NDD-CKD patients with eGFR<25 ml/min who transitioned to RRT over the 5-year period 1/1/2008-1/1/2013. These cohorts will also provide annual linkage to projected (2013- 2016) data from over 4,000 incident ESRD patients including several hundred kidney transplant recipients each year for 4 years, hence adding over 16,000 linked patients who will transition to RRT. We hypothesize that (1) a pre-RRT data-driven individualized approach to the transition of care into RRT in very-late-stage CKD is associated with more favorable outcomes including greater survival, fewer hospitalizations and reduced costs, if the decision is based on pre-RRT factors such as clinical and lab variables including the CKD progression rate and comorbid conditions combined with demographics, and (2) that a scoring system derived from these pre-RRT data can determine the timing, preparation and modality of RRT to achieve better outcomes. Upon linking the national VA and regional KPSC data with the USRDS to identify those who have transitioned to dialysis or transplantation, we will examine the predictors of short- (first 6 months) and long-term mortality, hospitalizations and costs by generating pertinent de novo variables including pre-RRT eGFR slope, laboratory data trends and comorbidity indices; and these pre-RRT variables on >36,000 transitioned patients will be linked and reported annually and eventually become available to the USRDS to share with researchers."

"9442825","Pathological events during eariy brain development are believed to hold the key to the emergence of  schizophrenia (SZ) in adulthood. Deficits in memory, attention and executive function, i.e. core domains of  the psychopathology of SZ, might be causally related to dysfunctional glutamatergic and nicotinergic  transmission. Kynurenine acid (KYNA), an astrocytic metabolite ofthe kynurenine pathway of tryptophan  degradation, is an endogenous inhibitor of a7nACh and NMDA receptors in the brain and has been  implicated in the pathology of SZ. Studies using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or post-mortem brain tissue of  patients with SZ suggest that an excess of KYNA might play a causative role in the disease. As an  endogenous antagonist at a7nAChRs and NMDARs, which are both critically involved in cognitive functions,  increased KYNA levels in the brain might be especially involved in the cognitive deficits that are seen in  individuals with SZ.  The connection between KYNA and SZ may have a developmental dimension as several ofthe risk factors  associated with SZ, including prenatal infections, result in the activation of a cytokine-responsive enzyme  that catalyzes an increase in the formation of kynurenine, the direct bioprecursor of KYNA. The proposed  project is based on recent studies showing that elevating brain KYNA from embryonic day (ED) 15 to  postnatal day (PD) 21 results in impaired cognitive function in the adult offspring. The planned experiments  are centered around the fundamentally new concept, supported by preliminary data included in this proposal,  that elevating KYNA during the prenatal developmental period alone may serve as a model to study the  etiology of cognitive dysfunction in SZ. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that elevated KYNA  formation during prenatal development, produced from its bioprecursor kynurenine, influences the  development ofthe brain and, as a result, alters kynurenine pathway dynamics, extracellular glutamate  levels, and modulates hippocampal-mediated cognitive behavior in adulthood. It follows, and will be tested  here, that inhibition of KYNA synthesis is a valuable therapeutic strategy to combat cognitive deficits in SZ."
"9461612","Visual working memory and attention depend on coordinated neural activity between the posterior parietal  cortex (PPC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). These two regions are directly linked by projections  from layer 3 pyramidal cells (PCs) that are predicted to mediate their functional connectivity (Project 4).  Consequently, cell-autonomous abnormalities in the neurons furnishing these projections are posited to  impair functional connectivity between PPC and DLPFC in schizophrenia (Project 5), leading to deficits in  WM and attention. A key element ofthis Central Hypothesis is that region-specific properties of layer 3 PCs  moderate the severity of the molecular (Projecti) and morphological (Project 2) pathology of these neurons  in schizophrenia; specifically, the pathology of layer 3 PCs is predicted to be more severe in DLPFC than in  PPC, and thus the projections from DLPFC-to-PPC are predicted to be more impaired than those from PPC-  to-DLPFC (Project 5). This project serves as a critical bridge between Project 1&2 studies of all layer 3 PCs  in human PPC and DLPFC and the Project 4 studies that focus on the layer 3 connections between PPC and  DLPFC in monkeys as follows: Aim 1 provides key assessments of our translational strategy for testing the  Central Hypothesis. First, it tests the idea that regional differences in layer 3 PC gene expression between  human PPC and DLPFC are conserved in monkeys. Second, by focusing on the layer 3 PCs that  interconnect PPC and DLPFC, it provides a robust test of the idea that region of origin accounts for  differences in gene expression by controlling for other factors known to be associated with differences in  certain molecular features or dendritic morphology of PCs. Thus, Aim 1 provides a key transition from Project  1&2 studies in humans of all layer 3 PCs (which cannot currently be divided into subsets based on their  principal axon projection) to studies of the subset that interconnect PPC and DLPFC in monkeys. These  region-defined differences in gene expression are predicted to be associated with differences in  morphological (Aim 2), and neurophysiological (Aim 3) properties of layer 3 PCs that provide the cellular  basis for the functional connectivity between monkey PPC and DLPFC studied in Project 4."
"9460398","During the past two decades a significant body of evidence has accumulated showing that metabolic oxidation/reduction reactions represent a significant underlying mechanism contributing to promotion and progression of malignancy, as well as a therapeutic target for selectively sensitizing cancer cells to therapeutic interventions. Evolving in parallel has been the recognition that advanced medical imaging techniques, measuring metabolic changes in cancer versus normal tissues before and during therapy show great promise in allowing non-invasive quantitation and monitoring of fundamental differences in cancer cell metabolism to improve cancer therapy. The Free Radical Metabolism and Imaging (FRMI) Program (32 full members and 9 associate members) representing 3 colleges and 10 departments was formed by a merger in 2014 of former programs in Free Radical Cancer Biology and Tumor Imaging to take full advantage of the convergence of the science in these two disciplines. The FRMI program has four research themes: 1) Free Radical Cancer Biology, the study of fundamental differences in redox biochemistry and its impact on cell signaling, genetics and epigenetics in cancer biology and therapy; 2) Redox-Based Therapeutics, the development and testing of novel cancer therapeutics based on exploiting fundamental differences in free radical metabolism to selectively eradicate cancer cells while protecting normal tissues; 3) Patient Outcomes and Molecular Imaging, the development of novel image- guided therapy approaches for enhancing and predicting patient outcomes in cancer therapy using molecular and metabolic imaging techniques; and 4) Novel Approaches to Diagnostic Imaging, the development of novel approaches that integrate state-of-the-art functional and anatomic imaging techniques into cancer biology and therapy. FRMI members were highly collaborative during the last period of support with a total of 250 cancer relevant publications (2011-2015) including 53% (n=133) involving collaborations between 2 or more members of the HCCC. Of the collaborative publications, 66% (n=88) were intra-programmatic and 60% (n=81) were inter- programmatic. In addition, 30% (n=76) were interinstitutional with members of the program co-authoring 45 publications with faculty members at other cancer centers in the United States. Ten manuscripts were published in high impact journals (impact factor ?10). The program members were supported by $5,857,820 of total peer-reviewed funding and $2,699,266 of NCI funding in the last year of CCSG support. The successful completion of the research initiatives pursued by FRMI would involve preclinical and clinical verification of a paradigm shifting approach for targeting oxidative metabolic processes in cancer cells as indicated by selective enhancement of therapeutic outcomes, and implementation of new image-based approaches to predicting clinical outcomes, monitoring response and guiding decision-making."

There are 4 specific aims in the project, the first is to consolidate the TMRC-supported  KAMRC as a center of excellence for surveillance and monitoring of L.donovani transmission and VL  incidence. We plan to continue the registration of new VL cases and vital events that occur in the  study population we have enrolled in the Health and Demographical Surveillance Site (HDSS) in  Muzaffarpur district. In a subset of this HDSS population we will conduct a repeat sero-survey to allow  us to compare the current prevalence of L. donovani infection with that in the 2007 survey, conducted  in the early years of the VL elimination initiative.  Other aims of Project 1 are (1) to use global metabolomic profiling to understand the role of  asymptomatic individuals in transmission (cross reference to Project 2) and progression to disease,  especially those that fall into different classes according to parasite load in the blood and/or ability to  make antigen-specific antibody versus T cell responses, (2) to study co-infections with other neglected  tropical diseases (NTDs) as a determinant for progression to VL, and opening up to a wider scope for  understanding NTDs in the project area, and (3) to use gut metagenomics to determine the  contribution of the gut microbiome, and the broader burden of gut pathogens, as risk factors for  progression to clinical VL.

"9461540","PROJECT SUMMARY This grant deals with Emission Computed Tomography (ECT), defined broadly as three- dimensional imaging of molecules or cells that have been labeled so that they emit light, high- energy photons or charged particles without significant alteration of their biological function. The labeling can use radionuclides or light-emitting molecules, so the emissions can be nuclear decay products, including electrons, positrons and high-energy photons, or visible or near-infrared photons. The main application of ECT, and the focus of this grant, is molecular imaging in clinical medicine and biomedical research. The basic premise of the proposed research is that common theoretical and computational challenges recur in all forms of ECT.  Five Specific Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will provide dedicated parallel computing systems and associated algorithms optimized for image science as applied to ECT. The systems will combine field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with a cluster of graphics processing units (GPUs) and fast interconnects.  Aim 2 is on imaging the radiance, a function that describes any radiation field in terms of six variables: 3 spatial coordinates, 2 variables specifying direction of flux and an energy or wavelength. We give particular attention to photon-processing detectors, which use advanced statistical methods to estimate as accurately as possible some subset of the six radiance variables for each detected photon or particle. Tools will be developed for analyzing all steps in the imaging chain in terms of radiance.  Aim 3 deals with a critical but often neglected issue in imaging: null functions, which are components of an object that make no contribution to the image data. We will develop methods to compute these invisible components and determine how they influence the ability to extract information from ECT images.  Aim 4 relates objects of interest in molecular imaging to the underlying physiology of the patient or animal subject being imaged. New mathematical tools, never before used in biology or medicine, will be applied to the analysis and optimization of ECT systems.  Aim 5 will develop task-based measures of image quality, which are crucial to any rigorous science of imaging. We will develop the theory and computational tools needed to assess image quality of ECT systems in terms of therapeutic efficacy as well as diagnostic efficacy, and we will develop algorithms to search efficiently for configurations of ECT systems that are optimal in terms of task performance."

Notably, our studies identified  inflammation as an early and critical step that links Ap to tau pathology and cognitive decline. Supporting  GWAS-derived evidence further reinforces the importance of inflammation, as single nucleotide  polymorphisms in many immune-related genes significantly increase the probability of developing AD.  Although inflammation is critical to disease progression, a detailed molecular analysis of specific  mechanisms of the inflammatory response is greatly needed. Among numerous inflammatory pathways  associated with AD, interleukin-ip (IL-ip) plays a critical pathogenic role. We hypothesize that AQ> alters  intracellular protein clearance and trafficking, exacerbating IL-ip-mediated inflammation, eliciting tau  pathology and synaptic and cognitive deficits. Our goal is to elucidate the impact of Ap on IL-ip signaling  with emphasis on fiie relevance of protein clearance for IL-ip synthesis and protein trafficking for IL-1  receptor 1 (IL-1 Rl) levels. We developed several new and exciting transgenic models and viral approaches  that add significantly to the field and enable us to dissect the molecular pathways by which Ap, IL-ip and tau  interact and the mechanisms by which they adversely impact cognition during different stages of the disease  process. Because a better understanding of these pathways is critical not only for academic reasons but  also for helping to identify novel drug targets, the translational impact of this work is quite significant.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Inflammation plays both a protective and damaging role in Alzheimer disease (AD), so to identify a long  lasting and effective treatment, it is important that we better understand its underlying processes. Our studies  implicate a critical cytokine called interleukin-ip (IL-1P) as a factor that accelerates AD pathology. Here we  propose to study the molecular mechanisms by which this cytokine alters basic cell biological functions and  how these changes affect AD pathogenesis."

"9650538","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The burden of prostate cancer among Veterans is substantial with over 200,000 survivors and  12,000 new diagnoses annually. Most men live with rather than die from this common disease  making prostate cancer survivorship care especially important. Because of its leadership in  chronic disease care and the proportion of older men served, the Veterans Health  Administration (VHA) is well positioned to become one of the national leaders in prostate cancer  survivorship care. However, the quality of Veteran prostate cancer survivorship care is largely  unknown. In addition, there is poor consensus about whether primary care providers or cancer  specialists should have primary responsibility for ongoing cancer surveillance and management  of treatment-related side effects (e.g., incontinence, osteoporosis). Ultimately, the design and  implementation of tools to optimize prostate cancer survivorship care rests upon understanding  how responsibility for survivorship care is managed and the barriers to good survivorship care.  This research program will improve our understanding of Veteran prostate cancer survivorship  care and seek to improve it using state-of-the-art implementation science methods. This  program has three aims. Aim 1: To examine variation in 2 key quality indicators of prostate  cancer survivorship care. Using national VHA data (2005-2011), we will examine variation in  the quality of prostate cancer survivorship care for cancer surveillance and bone density testing.  Aim 2: To assess barriers and facilitators to delivering high quality prostate cancer  survivorship care. Guided by theory, we will perform focus groups and interviews with primary  care providers and prostate cancer specialists to better understand how to improve survivorship  care. Aim 3: To develop, implement and pilot a theory-based intervention to improve the  quality of prostate cancer survivorship care. We will use our findings to pilot an intervention  that addresses quality gaps in cancer surveillance and bone density testing uncovered in Aim 1,  in preparation for a randomized trial. Due to the expanding population of Veteran prostate  cancer survivors, optimizing their quality of survivorship care is of the utmost importance. Our  findings will inform models for cancer survivorship care across VHA and guide future  implementation efforts to improve the quality of cancer care."
"9395721","Background: Primary care physician (PCP) shortages are a significant and growing problem confronting the US healthcare system. An overall shortage of up to 53,000 PCPs is projected in the US by 2025, due in part to increased demand for primary care services because of an aging population, growing disease burden and a declining interest in primary care careers among medical residents. A shortage of PCPs in VA has recently come under increased focus due to the emphasis on improving Veterans? access to high quality and timely healthcare. Providing timely access to primary care requires a sufficiently large PCP workforce. However, as of May 2016, VA was reported to have been trying to fill up to 500 PCP positions, reflecting roughly 12% of the current VA PCP workforce. Prior research has not examined several important individual, economic, job and system-level factors associated with the recruitment and retention of PCPs by health systems. These understudied factors include components of pay and compensation, academic affiliation, elements of the patient-centered medical home model and workplace climate, which represent areas where VA data offer unique contributions. In addition, no prior research has examined the relative importance of factors in explaining PCP recruitment and retention. Identifying and prioritizing key factors associated with PCPs? employment choices will help VA and other health systems with the strategic recruitment of PCPs and the development of evidence-based strategies to retain high quality PCPs. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to: 1) identify and prioritize individual, job, economic and system- level factors associated with the choice of VA for employment and selection of rural practice (i.e. recruitment) using existing VA data as well as new qualitative and survey data collected for this study and 2) identify and prioritize individual, job, economic and system-level factors associated with long-run retention of PCPs within VA and in rural VA clinics using administrative data and existing survey data. Methods: This mixed methods study will examine VA administrative data, existing VA employee survey data, public health resource data and new qualitative and survey data collected for this project. To measure factors associated with VA recruitment and choice of rural practice setting (Aim 1), we will conduct structured interviews with current internal medicine residents exposed to VA settings during their training and new PCPs with a permanent VA position. We will then develop and administer a new survey instrument using key factors identified in qualitative interviews and factors of particular interest in this study. Triangulation will then be used to assess whether key factors and themes established in qualitative analyses generalize to the larger population of internal medicine residents and new VA PCPs. We will perform descriptive analyses to compare influential factors identified in interviews and surveys between residents and new PCPs. Multivariable analyses will be used to identify factors that are significantly associated with consideration of VA employment and rural practice among internal medicine residents. For Aim 2, we will use VA administrative databases to track the employment status of VA PCPs longitudinally. We will identify all PCPs assigned to a panel of primary care patients who met a minimum clinical full-time equivalent (FTE) threshold and were employed by VA at any time during the period 2003-2016. We will link administrative data with VA and public survey data to examine key factors of interest. Statistical methods for survival data analysis will be applied to assess the influence of hypothesized factors on quarterly retention probabilities and PCPs? expected duration of VA employment. Parallel analyses will assess PCP retention in rural VA facilities. Secondary analyses will examine the longitudinal profile of clinical FTE using an extended two-part model. In both aims, we will apply econometric methods including Shapley value decompositions to partition the variation in PCP recruitment and retention explained by key explanatory factors and factor combinations."
"9657408","Abstract ? Project 1  Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer. Lung cancer is among the best examples of a disease resulting  from a complex interaction between environmental exposures and genetic factors. Germline genetic findings make  an important contribution to the definition of high-risk individuals and provide key insights into LC etiology. LC  genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified informative loci that have influenced our approach to  tobacco control and provided new insights into tumorigenesis. We have identified 24 loci with involved in cancer  susceptibility. However, the interplay between inherited susceptibility and effects from demographic and  environmental factors has not been elucidated. We hypothesize that genetic variation influences both smoking  behaviors and cellular processes that jointly lead to lung cancer development. Our specific aims are: Aim 1  of this project will characterize the contribution of common genetic variation to lung cancer etiology. We  will analyze GWAS of lung cancer from 47,506 lung cancer cases and 63,687 to identify factors influencing lung  cancer risk according to histology and host-characteristics. Mechanisms by which these variants influence cancer  risk will be explored using eQTL based procedures and through annotation of existing databases. Aim 2 will  investigate uncommon genetic variants for LC susceptibility. We will analyze exome germline sequencing  information from over 2,500 lung cancer cases and 2,000 controls use these for imputation and rare variant  analysis. Aim 3 will identify genetic effects on smoking behavior. For this aim, we will integrate the large-scale  genetic studies we have conducted with extensive phenotyping performed through the lung cancer cohort  consortium (LC3) and project 2 to identify the specific impacts of SNPs on smoking behaviors. Aim 4 will  characterize joint effects of environmental and genetic interactions on lung cancer risk. This extensive data  and information from cohort studies we have assembled will allow us to model joint effects of smoking and genetic  factors on lung cancer risk over time. Supported by the biostatistical core we will perform mediation analyses to  partition risk among multiple smoking phenotypes and genetic factors. We will also use the genetic data to perform  Mendelian randomization to evaluate the relevance of biomarkers in predicting lung cancer risk, to assist project 2.   "
"9443441","Abstract  There is renewed awareness of the importance of the renal epithelium generally, and the proximal tubule specifically, as both a target and a mediator in chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Numerous studies have highlighted the importance of tubulointerstitial injury as an ultimate driver of progression of kidney disease. There is also increasing evidence that effective recovery of epithelial integrity following acute kidney injury (AKI) is vital to prevent development of CKD (1). Furthermore, recent studies indicate that the proximal tubule is an important target and contributor to development of diabetic nephropathy.  Our previous studies have implicated regulated activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) in the proximal tubule as an important mediator of recovery from AKI (3) (4) and persistent aberrant EGFR activation as a significant contributor to pathologic development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in response to hypertension and diabetes (4, 5). Although our previous studies have identified classic signaling pathways, such as the MEK/ERK1/2 and PI-3K/AKT pathways, immediately downstream of EGFR activation in mediation of these responses, the ultimate effectors of EGFR signaling that mediate the regeneration following acute injury and the aberrant responses leading to tubulointerstitial fibrosis have not been adequately elucidated. In this regard, we have recently found evidence for an important role for the HIPPO/YAP pathway in the mediation of EGFR's effects in both proximal tubule diabetic injury and in recovery from AKI (2) and preliminary data). Aims 1 and 2 will utilize in vivo studies with both genetically modified mice and specific pharmacologic inhibitors and targeted in vitro studies to elucidate roles and mechanisms of EGFR-dependent proximal tubule YAP activation and function in both AKI (Aim 1) and CKD (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will employ novel models of proximal tubule- directed tubulointerstitial fibrosis to investigate the crosstalk between the tubule epithelium and renal fibroblasts. We hypothesize that aberrant proximal tubule production of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) plays an important paracrine role to transform quiescent renal fibroblasts into active myofibroblasts. We also hypothesize that renal fibroblasts develop a dependence upon aerobic glycolysis (?Warburg phenomenon?) and that inhibition of glycolysis in these cells will prevent myofibroblast transformation and decrease development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis.  There are three specific aims: Aim I Determine the Role of EGFR Activation of the Hippo/YAP Pathway in Recovery From Acute Kidney Injury Aim 2 Determine the Role of Hippo/YAP Signaling in EGFR-Mediated Tubulointerstitial Fibrosis Aim 3 Determine the Role of EGFR in Mediating Myofibroblast Transformation and Proliferation  The ultimate goal of these studies is to understand physiologic regulation of proximal tubule regeneration and the pathophysiologic mechanisms mediating the development of progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis and to identify new targets for prevention and treatment of renal fibrosis."
"9488229","PROJECT SUMMARY Fatty liver disease (FLD) is a major public health issue affecting millions of people worldwide. Chronic FLD is defined by excess liver fat (hepatic steatosis) and can lead to a more profound disease state of steatohepatitis (SH) that may be reflected in hepatic fibrosis (including severe cirrhosis at the extreme). SH can lead to liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Multiple risk factors predispose individuals to the development of FLD including biological factors (obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes) demographic characteristics (e.g. sex, age and ethnicity), behavioral and lifestyle-related variables (e.g., alcohol intake, dietary behavior and physical activity), and both endogenous (e.g., infectious agents such as hepatitis viruses, microbiome variability) and exogenous environmental factors (e.g., exposure to pollutants/contaminants/toxins). Mexican Americans are disparately impacted by nonalcoholic FLD with some of the highest observed prevalences in the world and exhibit a prevalence of cirrhosis that is 9 times the national average. Although there is a heritable component of FLD risk, the dramatic increase FLD and HCC prevalence over the past 20 years clearly points to a major role for environmental factors since genetic variation is effectively constant on such a timescale. In this project, we will use high-dimensional omic characterization of Mexican Americans living in South Texas to assess the FLD-relevant environmentally determined exposome. We will recruit 1,000 participants from the longitudinal San Antonio Mexican American Family Study (SAMAFS) to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to obtain measures of liver fat and liver fibrosis. Each participant has previously been completely genetically characterized by whole genome sequencing, and the WGS data will be employed to optimally identify the exposome for FLD risk in a minority population. To achieve these objectives, we will: (I) perform MRI-based measures of liver fat/fibrosis and omic characterization of 1,0000 individuals from large extended SAMAFS pedigrees, including metabolomic profiling, lipidomic profiling, epigenomic analysis, and transcriptomic sequencing; (II) detect environmental effects on FLD risk using a novel statistical genetic approach to maximize systematic environmental signals and search for environmental factors reflected in high-dimensional metabolomic/lipidomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic biomarkers that are correlated with FLD risk; (III) characterize/classify environmental signals with regard to major environmental domains through the identification of non-random spatial distribution, or correlation with known components such as dietary behavior, socioeconomic factors, exogenous exposures, etc.; (IV) detect genotype x environment interactions using the omic data to detect genetic factors involved in the differential response of FLD risk to novel environmental factors. Overall, the ability to identify novel environmental determinants of chronic liver disease risk in an ethnic minority population provides a major opportunity to speed the development of improved targeted treatments."
"9461616","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing evidence from epidemiology, genetics and clinical neuroscience implicates neuroimmune mechanisms in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ) and other developmental psychiatric disorders. A new class of animal models of maternal immune activation (MIA), expressing developmentally phenotypic features related to SZ, has been developed; however, little is known about the mechanisms by which MIA results in changes to brain development, connectivity and behavior. The UC Davis Conte Center seeks to bridge that gap. Supported by pilot funding for the past three years, this team has worked together to develop hypotheses, design experiments and collect preliminary data to develop the present application. The Center comprises an accomplished group of investigators from molecular and cell biology, systems and behavioral neuroscience, biomedical engineering, neuroimaging, and clinical neuroscience and a highly integrated set of studies conducted across species and scale to test the hypothesis that MIA contributes to SZ by altering immune molecules in the brains of offspring, which, in turn, alters cortical connectivity, function and behavior during development. Synaptic changes, gene expression, structural and functional connectivity, neural inflammation and behavior will be measured in mouse and non-human primate (NHP) models at multiple ages to determine the timing and hierarchy of the effects of MIA. When possible, parallel studies in humans will be conducted to establish the clinical relevance of the MIA animal models. The Center will pursue two Specific Aims to determine: 1) if MIA increases risk for neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders in offspring by altering neural circuitry through dysregulated signaling of immune molecules and gene networks throughout development; 2) the timing of the appearance and progression of structural and functional changes in the brains of MIA offspring relative to the onset of dopamine dysregulation, neural inflammation, and SZ-related behavioral disturbances in the MIA NHP and compare these data to those seen in first-episode SZ. The projects will measure changes in synaptic connectivity, gene expression, structural and functional connectivity, neural inflammation, and behavior in parallel mouse and NHP MIA models at multiple ages to determine the relative timing and hierarchy of these changes and understand the underlying mechanisms. These studies in the mouse and NHP model will be complemented by novel analyses of synaptic connectivity and gene expression in post mortem human tissue from SZ."
"9452958","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and health complications related to obesity, including diabetes, impact a significant proportion of the population in the United States, and projections indicate that the number of obese and overweight individuals will continue to rise in the future. The costs of health care due to the physical and psycho-social problems caused by obesity and related complications, coupled with the associated loss of productivity, is staggering. Improving strategies to induce lifestyle changes among the obese and overweight population is a necessary step toward alleviating this problem, but this approach should be complemented by the development of interventions to control the physiological processes regulating weight gain. Such interventions may include small molecules that modulate regulators of adipose formation and function. Development of such tools will depend upon continued basic research addressing the physiological processes regulating adipogenesis and adipose function. We provide evidence that two enzymes that function as coactivators of adipogenesis, Prmt5 and Jmjd6, drive adipogenesis in a manner that is independent of their catalytic activity. This means that these regulators employ novel and undefined mechanisms to promote adipogenic differentiation. We propose to globally define the functions of these regulators in adipogenesis and to perform structure/function analyses to identify the protein domains that are responsible for the functions that contribute to adipogenesis. The work will address how these regulatory proteins influence both higher-order and local chromatin structure, binding of other regulatory proteins to chromatin, and gene expression. The results of these studies will shed new insight into the regulation of adipogenesis and potentially provide new targets for therapeutic interventions that may be of future use for the treatment of obesity and obesity related disease."

"9538808","PROJECT SUMMARY - CLINICAL CORE The prevalence of HAND in HIV+ individuals with advanced infection remains around 40-50%, and HAND may now be the most common form of young-age neurocognitive impairment globally. Currently there are no uniformly accepted clinical, neuroimaging, or laboratory outcome measures for clinical trials for the treatment of HAND. This Core provides the support necessary to evaluate new outcome measures of CNS function including both neurocognitive assessments (e.g., screening tests for HAND) and performance based functional assessments. In addition, the Core will provide well-characterized individuals for developmental projects such as novel neuroimaging outcomes which may be more sensitive to CNS dysfunction and response to treatment than neuropsychological test measures. The Clinical Core will also provide well-characterized individuals for evaluating novel laboratory markers identified in the Biomarker Core. Specifically, we will examine markers of cell stress, neuronal injury, and energy metabolism, which are also being used as platforms for therapeutic targets in our Therapeutic Core. The goals and objectives of this Core are as follows: 1) To maintain a clinical cohort of well-characterized HIV+ and demographically-matched HIV- individuals to improve the efficiency of accruing and conducting clinical trials, 2) To liaise with other NIMH Centers, other funded IPCPs, the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG), the Johns Hopkins University Center for AIDS Research (JHU CFAR), Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR), and the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Drug Discovery unit to assist in the development of interventional therapeutics for HAND, 3) To provide the infrastructure and resources necessary to conduct small early phase studies to evaluate therapeutics for HAND including novel drugs, neuromodulation and behavioral strategies, 4) To maintain a data infrastructure to allow for efficient querying of clinical and laboratory data, 5) To provide statistical support for all studies involving the Center Grant resources."
"9490327","The accelerating incidence of diabetes and metabolic disorders and the continuing high prevalence of endocrine disorders in the American population demands continued exploration of a broad array of corresponding mechanistic pathways, pathophysiologic sequelae, and potential therapeutic approaches. In many cases these investigations can be accomplished most efficiently using model systems established in intact animals. The use of mouse models in these pursuits is now well established for its power, feasibility, and enormous potential. Creation of such models, by directed alterations of the mouse genome, is an essential component of an overall research effort in diabetes, obesity, and metabolic disorders. The Transgenic and Chimeric Mouse Facility (TCMF) provides investigators of the University of Pennsylvania Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center (DRC) with the ability to carry out these studies in a cost effective and efficient manner. The TCMF applies state-of-the-art equipment and technology by a group of dedicated and highly skilled technical staff to this effort. The major services of the Core include generation of transgenic mice by DNA pronuclear injection, creation of chimeric mice by ES cell blastocyst injections, direct genome mutation/editing/modifications by targeted endonuclease (TALEN and Crispr-CAS) technologies, assisted (in vitro) fertilization, cryopreservation, long-term cryostorage, and shipping of frozen embryos or sperm to/from other facilities. The Core uses multiple microinjection platforms, laser-assisted technologies, state-of-the-art cryopreservation of gametes and embryos, and in vitro fertilization based line re-derivation to facilitate these goals. The facility consists of a microinjection suite, an adjacent dedicated cage room, and an off-site and highly secure cryopreservation storage facility.

"9462127","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to identify and characterize new genes, pathways and molecular mechanisms that contribute to elevated IOP and glaucoma. This is a critical step for rationally improving the care of patients. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) isa major risk factor for glaucoma. The mechanisms underlying IOP elevation and glaucoma are largely unidentified. We study the genetics of glaucoma using both the human and mouse. Using mice to discover glaucoma pathways is an important approach, as mice are experimentally tractable, and it remains difficult to identify many glaucoma genes in patient populations.  (Aim 1) We will use the power of mouse genetics to identify novel genes and mechanisms that induce IOP elevation in new glaucoma-relevant mutants that we have discovered and started to study. We will characterize the genetic pathways involved and carry out more detailed investigations into the molecular pathogenesis. We will collaborate to assess the human orthologs of the identified genes in human patients.  (Aim 2) The limited availability of useful mutants remains a major factor hindering glaucoma gene discovery using mice. Thus, we will conduct a phenotype driven mutagenesis screen to identify novel genes and molecular mechanisms involved in IOP elevation and glaucoma. We propose a sensitized ENU screen for glaucoma mutations. We will sensitize the screen in various ways including a mutation in the mouse ortholog of a human gene that predisposes people to high IOP and glaucoma, a predisposition that we have repeated in mice. To hasten the discovery of glaucoma-relevant genes and mechanisms, we will complement genetics with state-of-the-art sequencing and genomic approaches. Continuing to use the power of a phenotype-driven mutagenesis screen, in parallel with our proven experience in determining disease mechanisms and in examining ocular phenotypes, will enable us to identify and characterize new genes and molecular processes that contribute to elevated IOP and glaucoma. The new mutants will have great potential to transform our understanding of glaucoma."
"9461620","SUMMARY: PROJECT 2 There is a lack of understanding in the field of mental health of the mechanisms by which environmental or maternal factors influence disease susceptibility, specifically with neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ). The long-term objective of Project 2 is to connect the molecular pathways disrupted in the offspring after maternal immune activation (MIA) in the mother to cellular, circuit and neurobehavioral alterations that lead to SZ and perhaps other allied neurodevelopmental disorders. To accomplish this objective, the project will undertake four specific aims. First, the Geschwind lab, in collaboration with the Nonhuman Primate (NHP) Core, will identify the transcriptional signature of MIA in the PFC, ACC, HC and VC in an extensively characterized NHP model. The lab will use advanced, next-generation sequencing methods to measure genome-wide transcriptome changes in four relevant brain regions in a well-characterized 4-year-old cohort of NHPs exposed in utero to MIA and compare this with matched controls. Second, the research team will characterize and integrate the transcriptional signature caused by MIA in the PFC, ACC, HC, and VC in a validated mouse model at four developmental ages to compare to changes observed during psychosis and to determine the developmental progression of changes in gene expression. The work will focus on the same 4 regions as in the NHP using RNAseq methods, but have the additional advantage of spanning the full time course over the development of molecular and behavioral alterations so as to develop causal models and identify changes shared across species. Third, the project will identify changes in the transcriptome in the PFC, ACC, HC, and VC in well-characterized individuals with SZ and matched controls. The same RNAseq methods used in Aims 1 and 2 will be applied so as to ensure direct comparability between the species, SZ patients and controls for the first time. In the fourth aim, a systems biology framework (WGCNA) will be used to integrate NHP, mouse and human transcriptional data. Using a powerful network analysis, WGCNA, the project will identify key co-expression modules associated with MIA across species and time, as well as the regulatory network that drives these changes, and determine whether these changes in gene expression correlate with the magnitude of cortical inflammation (Project 1), dysregulation of subcortical DA (Project 1), changes in anatomical and functional connectivity (Project 2), changes in synaptic connectivity (Project 4), and changes in expression of immune molecules in the brain (Project 4). This will enable development of true causal models that connect molecular pathway alterations at the level of gene expression to the ontogeny of cellular changes, anatomical changes and behavioral changes that follow in utero exposure to MIA. The single-platform, cross-species design will enable a more-definitive determination of the relationship of these changes to SZ in humans and provide a framework for assessment of other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Austism Spectrum Disorder."

"9474614","Project Summary Currently, 86 million Americans have prediabetes, but 9 in 10 of them remain unaware. Randomized trials have demonstrated that more than half of all new cases of type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed when high risk adults are offered resource-intensive lifestyle intervention programs, such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). While numerous organizations have engaged in efforts to expand screening and subsequent access to interventions for adults with prediabetes, those services are far from routine in clinical and public health practice. However, implementation efforts in this arena are expected to accelerate rapidly during the next 3 years as several forthcoming policies will catalyze efforts to identify and intervene upon prediabetes. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently issued a grade B recommendation that all overweight or obese adults with cardiovascular risk conditions (including prediabetes) be offered intensive lifestyle interventions, specifically referencing the DPP as a case example. This recommendation, together with Affordable Care Act (ACA) legislation requiring commercial and public payers to provide coverage of USPSTF A and B recommendations, has led payers to begin structuring coverage policies that will include a mix of clinical and community intervention services. In parallel, key stakeholders such as YMCA of the USA and the American Medical Association (AMA) have engineered a series of strategic regional initiatives to strengthen healthcare-community linkages for the screening and diagnosis of prediabetes, as well as the coordination of referrals to community-based interventions, and the billing and payment for delivery of those interventions. In close collaboration with these stakeholders, we propose this natural experiment, employing a mix of qualitative and quantitative research methods, and leveraging available data from the Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI), OptumHealth Care Solutions, and other accessible sources to evaluate the reach, implementation, effectiveness, and costs of these interrelated policies likely to impact the prevention of type 2 diabetes for potentially several million Americans over the next 5 to 10 years. Our proposal aims to: (1) evaluate and compare the impacts of large-scale, regional healthcare-community linkages on changing rates of prediabetes screening, diagnosis, and National DPP intervention attendance following enactment of USPSTF recommendations for those services; (2) describe implementation features and elicit barriers and facilitators of implementation, replication, and future scaling of large-scale regional initiatives; and (3) compare the effects of exposure to the YMCA?s DPP on healthcare costs and utilization for different subgroups of patients with prediabetes. This evaluation will provide critical information about whether particular strategies should be discontinued, refined, or replicated on a larger scale to achieve maximal impact over the coming decade."
"9462870","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of this research is to determine the molecular basis of membrane traffic in mammalian cells. The focus is on mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) that deliver newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes from the Golgi to pre-lysosomes, and then return to the Golgi to pick up more cargo. We have shown that the protein, GCC185 is needed for tethering of MPR-containing vesicles at the trans Golgi. To verify how GCC185 is anchored and to define the molecular composition of the microdomain where GCC185 functions on the Golgi surface, we will use a novel biotinylation approach to tag nearest neighbors. This will help us understand the difference between the distinct domains occupied by GC185 and Golgi-245 on the trans Golgi. To investigate the mechanism of MPR vesicle tethering at the Golgi, we will analyze the structure of GCC185 using atomic force microscopy and tracking fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, to analyze the importance of core flexibility for tethering function. We will also carry out rescue experiments to test the function of mutant proteins that may not be flexible. Our structural data suggest that the protein may collapse on the Golgi rather than bend in the middle. To distinguish directly between tether bending and tether collapse, we will attempt to biotinylate only GCC185 peptides that are in close proximity to the Golgi surface and map these onto the GCC185 protein sequence. If GCC185 lies down on the Golgi, all peptides should be biotinylatable. Finally, we will isolate fluorescently labeled, mannose 6-phosphate receptor-containing vesicles and monitor how these engage the GCC185 tether. Where do the vesicles bind? What models best explain how GCC185 tethers vesicles at the Golgi? In summary, these experiments open up entirely new areas of investigation in the area of MPR trafficking and will provide fundamental information regarding the mechanisms of vesicle tethering at the Golgi in human cells. The work has broad application to our understanding of a number of disease states including diabetes, cancer, heart disease and neurological disorders."
"9470651","Abstract  To advance regenerative medicine towards recapitulating the structures and functions of human tissues at physi- ologic length scales and with relevant cell densities, strategies must be developed to meet their unrelenting metabolic demands. In order to effectively and ef?ciently oxygenate functional engineered tissues, we must understand how changes in oxygen tension modulate cell viability, proliferation, and phenotype. Decades of studying cell cultures incubated under low oxygen levels have unveiled some aspects of the hypoxic response and many key in- sights into its mechanism. Separately, an astonishing array of biomaterials have been developed which can support cells in 3D environments and can recapitulate native cell morphologies and functions to a much greater extent than 2D culture. However, as emerging areas such as regenerative medicine have sought to incorporate cells within these materials, new questions have emerged regarding the roles played by oxygen transport and hypoxia in directing the density and function of the cell populations. Currently, we lack a comprehensive framework to describe and pre- dict how cell populations will alter their densities and functions over time in the presence of spatiotemporally heterogeneous oxygen gradients. We need to extend our knowledge of cellular responses to hypoxia into 3D and we need to pro?le how tissue-speci?c cell functions are impacted by local oxygen cues. In this proposal, I and a sup- porting team of experts in biomaterials, computational modeling, and liver biology will unify computational models of hypoxic response with engineered model tissues to link oxygen transport with tissue function in 3D. Our ?ndings will be incorporated into an experimentally validated model capable of predicting how cell popula- tions change in density and function in response to speci?ed oxygen gradients. Cellular responses to hypoxia will be parameterized by cell-speci?c response functions and integrated with oxygen transport equations in an agent-based computational model. We will ?t parameters using advanced volumetric imaging and image segmentation along with biochemical assays to map cellular markers of viability, proliferation, hypoxia, and phenotype within 3D hydrogels containing HepG2 liver cells, a well-de?ned model cell type from a highly metabolic tissue. I hypothesize that our closed-loop computational and experimental work?ow will yield a scalable model of cell behavior at the tissue level which captures previously unstudied functional responses to hypoxia. Finally, to broadly pro?le the phe- notypic landscape of cells growing in the presence of oxygen gradients, we will use RNA sequencing to map spatial zonation of cell phenotypes along axial and radial oxygen gradients in perfused hydrogels. Controlled encapsulation of cells within hydrogels of reproducible architecture will enable us to evaluate these spatial patterns in gene expres- sion with a degree of experimental control and reproducibility beyond the capabilities of in vivo approaches. Taken together, these studies will provide fundamental insights into how cells respond to local oxygen gradients in 3D environments. Analysis of the spatial heterogeneity introduced by oxygen gradients is also expected to inspire new paradigms for engineering zones of cell function within tissues."
"9462026","ABSTRACT We propose that extracellular vesicles (EV) released from compartments along the endosomal-lysosomal (EL) pathway both reflect and contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We further hypothesize that AD-related dysfunctions in the EL pathway causing mistrafficking or preventing efficient degradation affect exocytosis and brain EV levels. These ideas are supported by our preliminary findings showing significant changes in the levels and content of brain EV in Down syndrome and with apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) expression, both of which cause EL alterations. We will investigate the mechanism(s) of neuronal and glial secretion of exosomes ? the better understood EV subtype ? by late-endosome/multivesicular bodies (LE/MVB) and the impact of endosome dysfunction on exosome, and more broadly, EV biology. Important mechanistic drivers of EL pathway pathology in AD that we will examine for their impact on brain EV are the ?- site cleaved carboxyl-terminal fragment of the amyloid ? precursor protein (?CTF), hyperactivation of rab5, and altered cholesterol trafficking/metabolism. Highlighting the integrative nature of this Program across the entire EL pathway, we will examine the novel idea that lysosomal exocytosis is altered by lysosomal hydrolytic and pH impairments associated with AD-risk factors including cholesterol perturbation, ApoE4, and loss-of-function mutations in presenilin 1 and 2. Aim 1 will use genetic models and crosses (Core B) and a high cholesterol diet (P1) to test in vivo the hypothesis that factors increasing endocytic drive promote EV release from the LE/MVB, while factors promoting lysosomal dysfunction will have a greater impact on exocytic release from lysosomes. We will characterize various brain EV types and their differential origins from neurons and glia. We will determine the molecular mechanisms underlying altered EV secretion, changes in EV uptake, and alterations in EV clearance from the brain in AD-relevant pathological conditions resulting from i) altered early endosomal function (with P1) and/or ii) lysosomal dysfunction (with P2). We will examine the proteome, lipidome (with Core C) and RNA content (with P4) of EV and of the intracellular compartments contributing to EV generation to identify pathogenic changes altering exocytosis. In Aim 2, using direct manipulation of EV generation and release relevant to disease mechanisms, we will identify manipulations that normalize EV levels, testing our hypothesis that restoring EV secretion can reduce cellular pathology. As a rescue paradigm, we will test cystatin C-derived small peptides to identify molecules with established cystatin C-like protective effects that, in addition to augmenting EV secretion, can alleviate endosomal pathology, induce autophagy and lysosomal degradation, and confer protection against neuronal loss and memory deficits. Thus, this Project will define the mechanisms regulating EV generation, secretion, and their content, test our hypothesis that pathogenic alterations of the EL pathway in AD disrupt brain EV release, and demonstrate that restoring normal EV production may be an innovative therapeutic approach for reducing EL pathway pathology in AD."
"9459424","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this program is to provide a 12 week mentored research experience for veterinary students at the University of Wisconsin. The 2014 NIH Physician-Scientist Workforce Working Group Report indicated a lack of critical mass among non-MD scientific clinicians. As traditional veterinary curriculum lacks research- related training, this summer research exposure experience is an essential way to expose DVM students to both the research process but also to encourage them to consider research-oriented careers. This program will also help recruit veterinary medical students with specific interest in this program to pursue the DVM at the University of Wisconsin, increase the number of minority students pursuing research training at the University of Wisconsin, inform veterinary medical students of careers in research, and provide participating students with an introduction to ethics, responsible conduct of research, and skills for successful careers in research. The over-arching objective of this program is to introduce veterinary medical students to research and provide them with at least a working knowledge of how to identify a problem of significance to the health and welfare of animals and/or humans, develop a hypothesis to test the question selected, identify and validate appropriate techniques to pursue the research, and analyze and report (orally and in writing) data. Trainees participate in regularly scheduled laboratory meetings and weekly seminars conducted specifically for students in the 12 week summer program. Trainees will either present the results of their research at the summer veterinary research scholars' symposium (typically the NIH-Merial Veterinary Scholars Program Symposium held annually in August) or present their research at seminars or symposiums held at the University Of Wisconsin School Of Veterinary Medicine. The University of Wisconsin in general, and the School of Veterinary Medicine in particular, has an ideal environment to support short-term research training of veterinary students. We anticipate that the proposed program will integrate smoothly with current training programs to provide a continuum of support for research training of veterinary students in Wisconsin."
"9487256","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A major problem in the field of eukaryotic infectious diseases remains unsolved: why are some parasites pathogenic but other closely related ones relatively benign? Here we propose to address this problem by studying malaria, a diverse suite of pathogens where some cause severe morbidity yet others can be asymptomatic. By studying the gene expression of malaria parasites that infect birds, we will elucidate the evolution of pathogenicity and identify genes that cause morbidity. We will test the hypothesis that certain genes are differentially expressed between virulent and benign pathogens. Using a bioinformatics approach, we will compare the transcriptomes of avian pathogens and identify whether different genes are expressed, and/or if they are expressed at different levels between the virulent and non-virulent Plasmodium species. By selectively mutating avian malaria genes, we will verify the alleles responsible for pathogenesis. The CRISPR/Cas9 approach has been used recently to disrupt genes in Plasmodium falciparum. This will be the first use of this approach in a non-mammalian malaria system. The proposed research is timely and significant in that it will advance the field of malaria research by providing an important new model system to identify factors contributing to malaria pathogenicity. This work is innovative because birds provide the only model system where two highly related malaria parasites cause such fundamentally different outcomes to both laboratory and naturally occurring wild hosts. The long-term and cross-disciplinary goal of this research agenda is to elucidate the evolution of pathogenicity and identify conserved virulence mechanisms that may be overlooked using mammalian model systems. The aims of the proposal are to: 1. Sequence the complete transcriptomes of select avian malaria parasites. 2. Characterize differences in gene expression between virulent and non-virulent parasite strains. 3. Use a CRISPR/Cas9 approach to disrupt virulence genes and confirm effects through the infection of laboratory birds. The project will support the education of future scientists through an integrative approach to research and education. It will train students in cutting edge technologies associated with infectious disease research, and provide valuable experiences for graduate and undergraduate students at an urban university serving large numbers of underrepresented minority students. The developmental objectives of the PI will be met by working with outstanding collaborators, which will further his training in the genomics of malaria."

"9456805","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mood disorders (MD) affect nearly 15% of youth and are severely debilitating. Mood impairments are often expressed through difficulties with adaptive emotion regulation that present clinically as persistent hyper- or hypo-reactivity of emotions (i.e., increased elation, irritability or anhedonia), and excessive approach or avoidance behaviors, resulting in significant psychosocial difficulties. Consistent with strategies set forthby the NIMH Research Domain Criteria, this project aims to characterize symptoms ...based on dimensions of observable behaviors and brain functions with a particular focus on biomarkers and behaviors associated with the positive and negative valence systems, such as approach motivation and response to reward/non-reward. This proposal aims to use neurophysiological markers (electroencephalography [EEG] and event-related potentials [ERPs]) of approach motivation and reward/non-reward sensitivity, as well as behavioral response (distress tolerance), to predict mood stability in 60 youth with MD. Identifying markers of symptom maintenance will elucidate intervention targets and aid in treatment selection. The study involves a single laboratory assessment and two symptom follow-up assessments at 3- and 6-months. This proposal provides the optimal training for the applicant to gain expertise in EEG methods and analysis needed to conduct independent, patient-oriented, neurodevelopmental research on neural mechanisms associated with approach motivation and reward sensitivity."
"9546683","This Technology Research and Development (TR&D) project aims to provide advanced, quantitative body MRI methods that can quickly be integrated into clinical testing or research studies. The development of MRI methods that have clinical impact demands substantial iteration based on feedback from human studies.

This proposal is primarily focused on techniques to image cancer, renal function and osteoarthritis-related conditions, though numerous other applications will likely emerge from the broad array of collaborations and service projects. The overall goals of this project are divided into 3 specific aims: (1) to offer a complete quantitative volumetric dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) acquisition, reconstruction and post-processing suite that is robust to motion, static and radiofrequency magnetic field variations and the presence of fat, (2) to develop highresolution quantitative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) methods that are robust to the challenges of motion in the body, and (3) to disseminate advanced musculoskeletal methods including a 5-minute 3D morphologic (fat and water) and quantitative (T2, T2* and diffusion) imaging method as well as a novel, rapid approach to distortion-corrected imaging near metallic implants. Collaborations will include numerous investigators who lead research projects and clinical services that utilize all methods in the aims. The project will leverage technology development within the Biomedical Technology Resource Center as well as other funded projects, including advanced sampling, compressed sensing, novel motion correction, multiband imaging, rapid steady-state imaging, quantitative signal model fits, and new approaches to imaging near metal. The main focus will be to combine technologies into robust implementations that can be used routinely in research studies and clinical settings."
"9458210","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this three-year postdoctoral training program is to empower the applicant with the necessary skills and network to establish an independent laboratory in the United States studying regeneration in newts (salamanders). Newts are critical components of the regenerative research landscape due to their ability to replace complex body parts after loss. Limb regeneration is an important model in this regard. Central to newt limb regeneration is the formation of a blastema; a heterogeneous mass of cells that develop into the new limb. Despite its centrality, we have a minimal understanding of the blastema and lack any specific expression markers. The applicant will identify the genes and cis-regulatory elements that regulate blastema formation in the Iberian newt and develop fluorescent expression markers to identify blastema cell types in vivo. This will be accomplished through the following research plan. First, functionally relevant genomic regions will be sequenced and assembled by a combination of whole genome sequencing and selectively sequencing open chromatin (Aim 1). Second, using single-cell transcriptomics, the cell types contributing to the blastema at will be classified and marker genes identified. Additionally, by integrating this single-cell transcriptomic information with obtained genomic sequences, cis-regulatory elements that are over- or under- represented in blastema markers genes will be identified (Aim 2). Third, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, transgenic newts expressing fluorescent blastema markers will be developed (Aim 3). The identified genes, cis-regulatory elements and transgenic newts will offer unprecedented knowledge and tools to further understand the regulation of regeneration, thereby enabling the applicant to begin a promising independent career in regeneration research."
"9460985","ABSTRACT Data Science and Applied Technology (DSAT) Core (RC4), a recent addition to the University of Florida (UF) Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC), provides an interactive data and technology ecosystem aimed at preserving mobility and preventing disability. Big data initiatives, applied technologies, and new methodological approaches for data science have grown rapidly in many various environments, and the world is moving toward a connected system of computing and sensing components. The broadly used term ?Internet of Things? refers to an environment in which detailed data are collected on health, activity, location, and other aspects of the participating entities. Flexible control of the different interconnected and frequently communicating components can provide a rich set of applications that can adapt dynamically to their environment. Additionally, mobile health (mHealth, smartphones and smartwatches) technologies are changing the landscape for how patients and research participants communicate about their health in real time. These possibilities have led the NIH to put forth large initiatives (Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) and The Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program) for meeting this new demand for knowledge. DSAT investigators provide OAIC leadership to assure that researchers in Geriatrics in general, mobility and disability are prepared for the rapid advances in these expanding technologies. The RC4 provides many unique attributes, such as: developing software for interactive mobile technology (e.g., wearable sensors that are programmable in real time); validating new sensing technology; warehousing data; repurposing data; and applying machine learning techniques to domain problems. DSAT provides a central hub of expertise in computer science, biomedical engineering, biomedical informatics, data science, applied technology, epidemiology, and content expertise in the assessment of mobility to:  ? Support OAIC cores, train Junior Scholars, and provide outreach to researchers and practitioners;  ? Advance interactive monitoring for assessing mobility phenotypes;  ? Warehouse and integrate multimodal data;  ? Conduct machine-learning and pattern-discovery analyses;  ? Harvest electronic health record (EHR) data to identify and recruit participants;  ?

"9648683","The purpose of this project is to study how the Fc portion of anti-influenza antibodies regulates host immunity during virus infection. The specific activity within the Fc of IgG molecules is determined by both protein sequence and the specific saccharide components within an N-linked, complex, biantennary glycan that exists on all IgG Fes. The titer of neutralizing antibodies present in host serum is the major correlate of protection against influenza virus infection. Historically, neutralizing antibodies have been defined as those that bind the globular head of the viral hemagglutinin (HA), thereby blocking attachment to host cells. More recently, the definition has been expanded to include antibodies that bind the highly conserved stalk domain of the HA and prevent viral entry by blocking fusion with the host cell. We have recently shown that the Fc portion of influenza-specific antibodies can be a critical determinant of the concentration at which antibodies gain neutralizing activity against influenza viruses. The first two aims of this study are designed as a detailed investigation into the role of Fc-FcR engagement in broad-spectrum neutralization of influenza viruses. We will study the role and mechanisms of FcR mediated effector pathways in protection conferred through both anti-HA and anti-neuraminidase (NA) antibodies.     The final aim of our study will investigate the role of the Fc glycan in human immunity against influenza viruses. The IgG Fc glycan is a powerful regulator of antibody effector function and its specific saccharide composition can determine whether an antibody has pro- or anti-inflammatory activity in vivo. It has been observed in mice and in humans that exposure to novel immunogens results in various modifications of IgG glycans; however, little is known about how this process is regulated or the biological consequences of such modifications. Our studies, to be conducted with human samples, are designed to address three fundamental questions related to Fc glycosylation as a determinant of immunity against influenza viruses: 1) does influenza virus vaccination induce a change in glycan composition, particularly in sialylation or fucosylation of flu specific IgG Fes in humans, 2) do the route of exposure and age of the patient affect patterns of post-vaccination Fc glycosylation , and 3) how does Fc glycosylation regulate immunity against influenza viruses in in vitro and in vivo models of infection?"

"9619477","Project Summary This project investigates the neurobiological mechanisms of sensory symptoms in patients with obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) and their unaffected siblings using task-based fMRI, resting-state functional connectivity, and diffusion MRI approaches. OCD is a chronic disorder presenting a high public health burden. Treatment presents a particular challenge because OCD is extremely heterogeneous, with clusters of symptoms likely derived from differing neural etiologies. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach seeks to address this problem by investigating dimensional components of behavior that more closely align with brain circuitry. This application focuses on the dimensional symptom of sensory phenomena (SP), which are uncomfortable or aversive sensory experiences that drive repetitive behaviors in OCD, including ?not just right? sensations, physical urges, and sensations of disgust. SP are very prevalent, occurring in 60-80% of OCD patients, and experienced as highly distressing. Unfortunately, SP are not well addressed by standard treatment approaches, which may be in part because their neurobiological mechanisms are not well understood. Our preliminary data indicated that severity of SP in OCD patients was associated with activation of the insula, somatosensory cortex, and motor regions ? areas previously associated with the detection of body sensation and physical urges ? during two different fMRI tasks. Furthermore, greater severity of SP was related to greater resting-state functional connectivity between somatosensory regions, insula, and prefrontal cortex. This project builds on these promising preliminary data to (1) investigate the neural mechanisms of SP in a larger OCD cohort showing the full range of SP severity and (2) probe for familial risk markers in unaffected siblings. For Aim 1, SP will be measured in 100 OCD patients using the Sensory Phenomena Scale. Diffusion and fMRI data will be acquired during rest and three fMRI tasks previously validated to recruit insula and sensorimotor regions. In order to identify familial risk markers, Aim 2 will compare sensory phenomena and neural circuitry between OCD probands, 50 of their unaffected biological siblings, and 50 unrelated healthy controls without a family history of Axis 1 disorders. Secondary analyses will investigate the relationship between neuroimaging measures and other dimensional symptoms relevant for OCD (perseverative thought, harm avoidance, perfectionism) to compare with results from the primary analysis of SP. This proposal investigates a significant and highly prevalent cluster of symptoms whose neurobiology remains elusive. Our use of complementary neuroimaging techniques will comprehensively assess the neural circuitry underlying SP and probe for markers of risk that could be targeted by future treatments."
"9451337","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurons have unique roles for lipids that are distinct from other cell types and are equipped with specialized machinery for regulating intracellular lipid metabolism. Although it is widely appreciated that the lipid composition of neurons is criticl for human development and defects in lipid metabolism result in severe and debilitating neurological disease, there is a dearth of understanding about how neurons regulate intracellular lipid metabolism at a fundamental level. Using tissue specific transgenic and knockout mouse models we have discovered that neurons regulate fatty acid flux and prevent lipotoxicity by hydrolyzing long chain acyl-CoAs to free fatty acid and CoA. This is mediated by the neuron-specific Acyl-CoA Thioesterase 7 (ACOT7). The loss of ACOT7 in mice and humans results in behavioral deficits and neurodegenerative disease. We have developed a new model describing the coordinated metabolism of fatty acids within the nervous system between neurons and astrocytes. We hypothesize that this is mediated by acyl-CoA hydrolysis within the neuron and fatty acid ?-oxidation within the astrocyte. Because of the critical importance of fatt acids to brain function and pathophysiology, a deeper understanding of fatty acid metabolism in the nervous system is greatly needed. The studies described herein will detail these fundamental unanswered questions. To test these hypotheses we propose two specific aims: 1) Determine the neuroprotective role and regulation of ACOT7. 2) Determine the roles and requirements for brain fatty acid oxidation. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms employed by the nervous system to regulate the metabolism of fatty acids. The expectation is that our proposed studies will describe new mechanisms for how fatty acid metabolism is regulated in the nervous system and more broadly, advance our understanding of the role of lipid homeostasis in neurological disease."
"9517122","Project Summary Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal, costly, autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease with no available disease-modifying treatments. While genetic testing can identify the presence of the mutant HTT gene, there are no markers to document the initiation of pathological changes or demarcate when preventive interventions are optimal to maximize quality of life. While clinical trials to slow progression and delay or prevent onset are beginning, methods to assess their efficacy are lacking. The proposed research will fill these gaps in our ability to design preventive clinical trials for HD. First, we will use the legacy PREDICT data to develop statistical models of onset, progression rate and phenotypic heterogeneity and then we will recruit 250 participants to complete the field's best Clinical Outcome Assessments (COAs) for premanifest HD and subject them to clinimetric tests of reliability, validity and responsiveness so future preventive trialists can utilize the information to design well-powered and efficient trials to delay the onset or slow the progression of HD"
"9541982","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problem in youth and are associated with significant disability and risk of recurrent and new onset psychopathology. Although strong evidence exists for the efficacy of CBT and antidepressants for anxiety, there are significant barriers impeding uptake of these interventions in clinical practice, contributing to lowest rate of treatment for this disorder for any youth diagnostic category (fewer than 1 in 3 youth). In order to address the public health need for low-cost, effective, accessible, and easy-to-disseminate services for youth anxiety, this application tests computerized Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) as a novel, alternative treatment with few or none of the barriers to uptake associated with extant evidence-based treatments. We will conduct a large (N = 498 ), randomized efficacy-effectiveness trial of CBM in youth ages 12 to 17, examined against the background of underlying treatment as usual (TAU). In this RCT, we test the level of support (scaffolding) needed to adequately deliver a self-administered variant of CBM to anxious youth, in preparation for future deployment- focused trials. Youth are randomized to either: a minimally effective attention-control version of the CBM program (Arm 1); self-administered active CBM that is downloaded and installed on participants' home computers (Self-Administered CBM-only; Arm 2), or to self-administered active CBM paired with an adherence promotion (AP) component delivered via brief telephone calls from study coaches, including brief motivational enhancement and/or technical assistance (Self-Administered CBM+AP; Arm 3). CBM sessions occur 3 times weekly over 4 weeks (12 total). Follow-up assessments occur at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post- enrollment. Compared to the control condition, we hypothesize that both active CBM conditions will yield greater anxiety diagnosis remission, and greater improvement for secondary outcomes anxiety and depressive symptoms and functioning. We also hypothesize that CBM+AP (Arm 3) will yield greater anxiety diagnosis remission and greater improvement in secondary outcomes, compared to CBM-only (Arm 2). We also will conduct cost effectiveness analyses and hypothesize that the incremental cost per unit of anxiety- free days and health-related quality of life will be lower for active CBM (Arm 2 + Arm 3) relative to the control condition (Arm 1). We will explore moderation and fidelity factors to inform future dissemination efforts; e.g,, whether CBM is robust to variation in youth clinical and demographic characteristics. We will test whether the CBM+AP condition results in higher participant engagement and compliance compared to the conditions without AP (Arm 3 vs. Arms 1 + 2). Finally, we will examine the mediating role of attention-bias change in producing CBM effects. Should CBM prove efficacious for anxiety and easily deliverable in this at-home, self- administered format, it will permit the broader deployment of a novel anxiety EBT to youth in great need."
"9461077","Riboswitches are dynamic RNA machines that detect and respond to metabolites, second messengers and ions. In most cases, binding invokes a conformational change in the ligand binding, or aptamer, domain that interfaces with the expression platform to regulate production of the downstream genes.  This proposal explores five riboswitch systems including: the second-messenger-signaling riboswitches that respond to c-di-GMP, c-di-AMP and c-AMP-GMP, the dual-aptamer glycine riboswitch that regulates genes involved in glycine metabolism, and the pfl riboswitch that regulates genes involved in purine biosynthesis and the folate cycle. This project will undertake structural, chemical and genetic approaches to understand these RNA machines, their aptamer domains, their small molecule effectors, and the genes whose expression they regulate.  The cyclic dinucleotides c-di-GMP, c-di-AMP and c-AMP-GMP control medically important phenotypes, including biofilm formation, sporulation, motility and virulence factor production. c-di-GMP analogues have been identified that bind their riboswitch targets but are resistant to nuclease degradation. Phenotypic effects of treating bacteria with these second messenger mimics will be explored and the cellular uptake properties of the analogues improved. The biochemistry and structure of the recently discovered c-di-AMP riboswitch in complex with its dinucleotide effector will be explored and analogues developed to target this signaling system. Similar work will be done on the c-AMP-GMP riboswitch using studies of the c-di-GMP riboswitch as a starting point.  The glycine riboswitches control genes responsible for amino acid homeostasis. They have a complex dual aptamer architecture with a single downstream expression platform. The molecular circuitry and regulatory wiring of this dual aptamer riboswitch will be investigated.  The pfl riboswitch commonly regulates expression of enzymes involved in the folate cycle. It is controlled by the purine biosynthetic intermediate 5-aminoimidazole 4-carboxamide monophosphate (ZMP or AICAR), which may serve as an alarmone in bacteria and is a signaling molecule in humans. The project aims to determine the X-ray crystal structure of the RNA aptamer-ligand complex and biochemically characterize the kinetics, thermodynamics and specificity of the interaction.  In addition to the riboswitch work, three new classes of catalytic RNAs have been discovered and the structure of the first, the Twister ribozyme, has been determined through the ongoing work of this program project. Nucleotide Analog Interference Mapping will be used to explore the chemical basis of catalysis by these widely-distributed and previously unknown self-cleaving RNAs."
"9611999","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We previously demonstrated that our early intervention model system, which was centered on using the CSBS to screen all babies at the 1-year check-up as standard of care, resulted in a mean age of 12 months for screening, 14 months for evaluation, and 18 months for treatment participation. These are far younger ages than is common in the U.S. Our 3-stage model system, Get SET (S=Screen; E=Evaluate; T=Treat) Early, screened >10,000 1 year olds in our first trial run1 detecting over 100 ASD and other developmental delayed toddlers. We will build on this highly effective model by implementing a new version in two major cities: San Diego and Phoenix; Los Angeles, Irvine, and Phoenix will provide baseline control data. In Phoenix, we test the feasibility of establishing the Get SET Early model in a city with one of the lowest median incomes and oldest age of first diagnosis in America. In AIM #1, the Screen and Refer Early stage, we will create a Pediatrician Network with 100 members. In San Diego we will utilize our existing Pediatrician Network and test new innovations such as a repeat triple screen at 12, 18, and 24 months to ensure that no toddlers are missed. Speed of referral for evaluation will be compared and contrasted using parent (self) and automatic (referral i- Pad App) options. We will track every toddler with an eventual ASD diagnosis within circumscribed medical groups to determine the true sensitivity and specificity of the screening tool and the percentage of ASD toddlers detected by our model. Anonymous survey data regarding screening habits will be administered to parents and pediatricians. AIM #2 implements the Evaluate and Refer Early stage. Its key attribute is an ASD Early Evaluation Clinic that specializes in the rapid scheduling and evaluation of every referred screened positive toddler. Toddlers will enter the program at the age they fail the screen (i.e., 12, 18 or 24 months) and will be thoroughly diagnostically evaluated and tracked once per year until they turn 3 years. This specialty Clinic is at our Autism Center in San Diego and will be developed at SARRC in Phoenix. Automated versus optional self-referral for treatment will be tested and compared. AIM #3 implements the Treat Early stage. Its key attributes are a network of providers of empirically based treatment and the innovative use of an inexpensive and readily available web-based treatment tracking system to document engagement. Treatment Networks will be created in San Diego and Phoenix. Primary outcome measures include rates and ages of screening and referral, evaluation and referral, and treatment engagement; sustainability across years; diagnostic, clinical and demographic characteristics of subjects; professional and parent satisfaction at each stage. We hypothesize that providing screening tools with clear cut-off scores and guidelines for automatic referral for evaluation and treatment, will result in dramatically lowering mean age of diagnosis and treatment in Phoenix from 4-5 years down to 1-2 years; San Diego will likewise have mean ages of 1-2 years for diagnosis and treatment making them significantly earlier than Los Angeles and Irvine control sites."
"9462798","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major health problem, resulting in a substantial increase in diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and heart disease and severe strains on healthcare systems. Reducing obesity demands an in-depth understanding of its causes at the cellular, molecular and organismal level. In an exciting new development, rare human variants in the scaffold protein SH2B1 have been identified that associate with profound childhood obesity, insulin insensitivity, and in some individuals, maladaptive behavior and speech and language delay. Some of these mutations are unique to specific SH2B1 isoforms. In vitro, isoforms of SH2B1 have distinctly different subcellular localization and ability to enhance neurite outgrowth and gene expression. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how SH2B1 regulates the neuronal circuitry that regulates, body weight, insulin sensitivity, behavior and learning. Our long-term goal is to identify pathways regulated by the SH2B1 isoforms that are critical for the establishment and/or maintenance of neural circuits important for normal feeding behavior and energy balance. Novel mouse models, primary cultured neurons and well characterized cultured cells will be used to test the central hypothesis that each SH2B1 isoform makes a unique and crucial contribution to the establishment and maintenance of neural circuits important for normal feeding behavior and energy balance. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing 3 specific aims: 1) Use novel in vivo mouse models to determine how the unique C-terminal tails of SH2B1 isoforms impact the function of LepRb-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus; 2) Determine at the cellular and molecular level how the C-terminal tails of SH2B1 isoforms regulate the function of SH2B1 in neurons with a particular focus on brain-specific SH2B1?; and 3) Define the role for SH2B1 isoforms in the regulation of body weight and insulin sensitivity. This research is innovative because: 1) SH2B1 was only recently implicated as a human obesity gene; 2) newly identified SH2B1 mutations in a unique cohort of obese individuals provide useful tools for studying causes of obesity; 3) the concept of coordinating an integrated response to neurotrophic factors by movement of scaffold proteins between the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus and nucleoli is novel; 4) present knowledge and tools now make it possible to study the mechanistic basis for the neuronal function of the various SH2B1 isoforms, their ability to regulate energy homeostasis in vivo, and their regulation of the transcriptome and neuronal circuitry of LepRb neurons; and 5) many of the proposed techniques and mouse models are cutting edge. These include CRISPR/Cas9 methodology to edit Sh2b1; novel mouse models to study the effect of SH2B1 on neuronal projections and gene expression of LepRb neurons relevant to feeding behavior and energy expenditure; and novel mouse models lacking specific isoforms of SH2B1 to study the impact of the specific SH2B1 isoforms in intact mice and isolated neurons."
"9524007","This resubmission is in response to the program announcement PA-16-088, with the title ?Oocyte Mitochondrial Function in Relation to Fertility, Aging, and Mitochondrial Diseases? by NICHD. Whether paternal mitochondria or paternal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are transmitted to offspring in humans is controversial. Maternal transmission of mtDNA results from the elimination of paternal mitochondria, which is controlled by gene products encoded by the nuclear genome. Due to maternal mtDNA transmission, a woman carrying a mtDNA mutation can pass this mutation to all of her children, with potential clinical consequences. The severity of clinical symptoms in affected children depends on the level of mtDNA heteroplasmy (coexistence of mutant and wild-type mtDNA). Our laboratory has identified two unrelated families with autosomal-dominant inheritance and multiple,high levels of mtDNA heteroplasmy. We have unequivocally demonstrated the existence of biparental mtDNA inheritance in humans. Our results challenge the central dogma of the maternal inheritance of mtDNA. Hereafter, we propose the following: 1) to recruit additional families with potential biparental mtDNA inheritance and examine the possibility of recombination of mtDNA; 2) to investigate gene(s) associated with biparental mtDNA inheritance; 3) to create a CRISPR knock-out mouse model and characterize gene(s) associated with biparental mtDNA inheritance in this model. At least one in every 5,000 people in the general population has an mtDNA mutation that may cause mitochondrial dysfunction and maternally inherited disease. Current clinical options to prevent transmission of mtDNA mutations to offspring are limited. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis to detect pathogenic mtDNA mutations is highly unpredictable. Nuclear transfer (mitochondrial replacement therapy) techniques seem to prevent mutant mtDNA transmission, but are very expensive and not performed clinically due to regulatory constraints. Elucidation of the molecular mechanism of paternal mtDNA transmission may provide an alternative approach to reduce transmission of mutant mtDNA to offspring by carrier women, thereby providing potential treatment options."
"9463632","Abstract Obesity and associated metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes is a current epidemic in the US and worldwide. There are no current safe anti-obesity drugs available and bariatric surgery, in combination with dietary and physical activity regimens, is considered the best option to treat obese patients. Thus, there is an urgent medical need to identify new therapeutic targets and develop new and safer drugs to treat obesity. Defects in energy expenditure in response to diet or lower temperatures cause obesity. A major site of energy expenditure is the brown or beige adipose tissue that contains thermogenic mitochondria equipped to uncouple respiration and produce heat. The presence in humans of these thermogenic adipocytes opens up the possibility to activate them and protect against obesity. In the previous funded period we have found that deficiency of the protein Clk2, a kinase downstream of feeding signals and insulin, in adipose tissue decreases energy expenditure and exacerbates body weight upon high fat diet feeding. Clk2-deficient brown adipocytes exhibit a failure in thermogenic function associated with low levels of Uncoupling protein 1. However, the regulatory components and mechanisms of how the feeding-regulated Clk2 kinase activity affects cold- and diet-induced thermogenic activity in brown and beige adipose cells and control whole body energy expenditure are unknown. The major goal of this grant renewal is to identify and analyze the molecular and regulatory mechanism whereby the protein kinase Clk2 activates thermogenic function in brown/beige adipose tissue in response to cold and diet and increases energy expenditure to protect against obesity and diabetes. The research strategy is focused on three central aims: 1) Molecular and functional analysis of how Clk2 kinase controls thermogenic gene expression programs in brown/beige adipose cells (Specific Aim 1), 2) Cellular, metabolic and bioenergetic analysis mediated by Clk2 kinase action in adipose cells and fat tissues ex vivo (Specific Aim 2) and, 3) In vivo metabolic and energetic analysis driven by Clk2 kinase in cold- and diet- induced thermogenesis (Specific Aim 3). The outcomes from these studies will identify novel molecular mechanisms and regulatory components by which brown and beige adipocytes control rates of energy expenditure and protect against diet-induced obesity. Since insufficient energy expenditure is a hallmark of obesity and associated pathologies, our studies may translate into potential therapies."
"9442828","People with schizophrenia are characterized by marked cognitive impairments, including abnormalities of  attention, processing speed, verbal and visual learning and memory, and working memory. Despite  treatment with first or second generation antipsychotics, they continue to exhibit these impairments. The  development of effective treatments for the enhancement of cognition remains a central therapeutic  challenge. The elucidation of metabolic pathways that are disrupted in schizophrenia provides a novel  approach for the identification of new drug development targets. There is emerging evidence to suggest that  kynurenine pathway disturbances may be related to schizophrenia pathophysiology. In particular, clinical,  genetic, and post-mortem studies have shown that the disruption of key regulatory pathway enzymes results  in increased CNS production of kynurenic acid (KYNA), a major tryptophan metabolite. KYNA is a known  antagonist of the a7 nicotinic and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors. Increased inhibition of  these receptors by KYNA is hypothesized to be a critical mechanism in the development ofthe cognitive  impairments observed in schizophrenia. The purpose of the current project is to examine the impact of  elevated KYNA formation on performance of cognitive tasks hypothesized to be impaired by the actions of  KYNA on a7 nicofinic and NMDA receptors. The study design will be a double-blinded, placebo-controlled,  cross-over tryptophan challenge study to examine the effect of increased KYNA on neuropsychological test  performance; fMRI activation and connectivity at rest and during the performance of a relational memory  task; 1 H-MRS measures of anterior cingulate/medial prefrontal glutamate; and peripheral markers of the  kynurenine pathway, HPA axis and inflammatory system activity. Tryptophan loading will be used to  increase KYNA levels. Participants will include people with DSM-5/DSM-IV-TR schizophrenia,  schizophreniform, or schizoaffective disorder and healthy controls. The study will provide critical new data  on the role of abnormal KYNA metabolism in schizophrenia, markedly enhance our understanding of the  pathophysiology of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia, and guide new drug development."
"9456821","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly one third of HIV-infected individuals develop neurocognitive deficits despite adequate cART and excellent virological control in the blood. This range of neurocognitive deficits is collectively referred to as HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Virus may also enter the brain again in the later stages of infection when there is a general immune failure. The ability of the virus to replicate depends on the cell type and its state of activation. Once inside the brain parenchyma, it resides in perivascular macrophages and microglial cells that provide the site of productive replication and evolution for HIV. Recent studies suggest that there is a substantial viral load in the meninges as well where there is a rich collection of macrophages. Within these regions, HIV infects the macrophages/microglia and astrocytes most commonly located in the perivascular regions where they constitute the blood-brain barrier. Perivascular and meningeal macrophages have been shown to be sites of active viral replication in the human brain. Exosomes are membrane-bound vesicles produced by a variety of cells that contain classical membrane marker proteins such as tetraspanins, adhesion proteins and metalloproteinases. They are considered to play an important role in intercellular communication either by target cell uptake or by inducing cell signaling via membrane receptors. In addition to membrane proteins, exosomes carry mRNAs as well as non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs that are thought to affect gene regulation in the target cells. Research by our group and others has shown that HIV-1-infected cells produce exosomes that activate naïve target cells through a dsRNA called TAR. Our long term goal is to understand the role played by exosomes originating from HIV-1 infected cells in regulating host-virus interactions. We hypothesize that unique viral RNA present in the exosomes of infected cells will alter recipient cells impacting regulation of gene expression and establishment of inflammatory response. Our aims include: To characterize the biogenesis and function of exosomes from infected donor cells under cART (Aim I); To characterize exosomes from infected cells treated with inhibitors and their cellular origin (Aim II), and defining the mechanim of TAR effect on TLR modulation and cytokine production in recipient cells. Collectively our data indicates that infected cells under cART still secrete TAR associated exosmes and that these exosomes activate the naïve recipient cells resulting in unwanted proinflammatory signals. These activities will be reversed with use of inhibitors and tested in both an in vitro BBB model and humanized latent model of HIV infection."
"9654985","Project Summary/Abstract Treating the immune response within tumors is a major focus of new therapeutic development. Much of the focus has been place on T cells, in particular via checkpoint therapies such as anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1. Little is currently known of how individual populations of myeloid cells can be partners for T cells. We have recently isolated rare populations of myeloid cells that appear critical for robust responses but we don't yet fully understand how they work. We hypothesize that rare stimulatory dendritic cells traffic antigens and stimulate T cell according to specialized rules and that harnessing and modulation of this pathway is part of the reason that checkpoint blockades may work. We further hypothesize that specific tissue-based cells are responsible for upregulating the critical cytokine to make stimulatory dendritic cells but that tissue production is dysregulated in cancer and possibly improved with checkpoint therapies. In this proposal we will be vastly extending an approach that my lab has been pursuing over the last few years. Specifically we will be extending our cell-biology based studies of these critical cells (Aim1) to understand how they play a fundamental role in antigen trafficking. Additionally, we will seek to understand how they hand off antigen to other antigen-presenting cells in the lymph node to engage T cells (Aim2) and how both of these processes are affected by checkpoint blockades. Finally, in aim 3, we will seek to understand the normal and intratumoral production of the cytokine Flt3L, a key player in regulating the number of these rare cells. At the end of this work, we will understand how these intratumoral myeloid cells function on their own and in concert with T cell therapies."

The candidate has received training in Physics; her research has focused on fMRI at low and high magnetic fields, on the development of research tools for the fMRI community, and on the investigation of brain function in health.  The K01 award proposal was designed to allow the candidate to become an expert bio-imager of the ascending arousal system (AAS). The candidate's objective for this K01 award period is to receive training in the neuroanatomy, neuroscience and patho-physiology of the AAS, an area different from her previous training and research focus. To conduct the proposed research, she will also gain new research skills in imaging and computational methods for neuro-anatomy. Further, the candidate seeks to strengthen her ability of formulating clinically relevant hypotheses, of using a diversified set of skills and tools to test these hypotheses properly and promptly, and of grant writing. This will be achieved by regular meetings with her mentors, her research and clinical collaborators, by attending to specific didactic courses / workshops / conferences, and by hands-on training during the development of the proposed research project.  Gray matter brainstem nuclei (Bn) of the AAS play a crucial role in regulating arousal, a key component of human consciousness. Because an in vivo identification of brainstem Bn of the AAS has been elusive so far by current imaging techniques, the neuro-anatomic and functional basis of arousal in health (sleep/wake conditions, anesthesia) and in disease (disorders of consciousness, sleep disorders) is poorly understood. The candidate's main research objective for this K01 award period is to develop and validate a novel procedure to delineate an in vivo probabilistic structural atlas of 13 human Bn of the AAS in MNI space. The procedure will use a newly developed set of methods to acquire multi-contrast echo-planar-images with exactly matched geometric distortion and resolution at 7 T, and semi-automatic segmentation procedures. Finally, this research project proposes to apply the developed tool to identify in vivo which Bn of the AAS are affected by hemorrhages in traumatic coma, and to evaluate the AAS connectivity in health and traumatic coma. Our preliminary results show the feasibility of generating a probabilistic template of four Bn of the AAS by 7 T multi- contrast imaging, of evaluating at 3 T the percent of injured tissue of these Bn in traumatic coma, and of mapping their functional connectivity in health. We share our enthusiasm with our collaborators that study the AAS in coma, sleep and anesthesia because the development of an in vivo atlas of Bn of the AAS might greatly advance the knowledge of the mechanism of arousal, improve the accuracy of prognostication in the early stage of coma, and facilitate the development of pharmaceuticals for altered states of arousal."

By monitoring the electrical activity of identified projection  neurons and by examining the impact of blocking projections between the two areas, the experiments will  test the specific prediction that direct projections are critical for functional connectivity (Aim 3). Results  obtained in Project 4 will have direct relevance to the Central Hypothesis regarding the origin of cognitive  deflcits in schizophrenia. This hypothesis states that cognifive deficits arise because pathological changes in  layer 3 pyramidal cells interfere with functional connectivity between prefrontal and parietal cortex. Projects  1-3 will focus on the properties of layer 3 pyramidal cells in the healthy brain and in schizophrenia. Project 5  will focus on funcfional connectivity in the healthy brain and in schizophrenia as measured with coherence  and causality analyses.

The Vanderbilt Diabetes Research and Training Center (VDRTC) was asked to lead this program because of its experience with a long standing medical student research program. This application, in response to the RFA for creating a National Enrichment Program, proposes an enhanced DK-MSRP that engages medical students from around the country in research and excites them about careers in discovery related to diabetes and its complications. The DK-MSRP consists of: 1) Nation-wide application process available to students from all US medical schools; 2) Matching of selected students with one of 15 NIDDK-supported Diabetes Research Centers; 3) Student-conducted research at a NIDDK-supported Diabetes Research Center; 4) Enrichment activities to educate students about diabetes and research opportunities; 5) National Research Symposium at the end of the summer; 6) Robust program evaluation; 7) Short and long-term career follow up of student participants; 8) Experienced administrative supervision, educational support, and advisory panel oversight; and 9) Synergy with other NIDDK-funded programs. Since its inception in 2009, 550 students from more than 100 medical schools have conducted research at one of the 15 NIDDK-supported Diabetes Research Centers during the summer between their first and second years of medical school. This program, with its considerable diversity in geography, ethnicity, and scientific area of research, has become a way to initiate research exposure for students who might not otherwise pursue this career path. The VDRTC and the DK-MSRP propose these specific aims: 1) Create and maintain an organizational structure that provides medical students with an in- depth experience in scientific discovery; 2) Provide access to online educational materials and seminars on bench, translational, and community research in diabetes and its complications; 3) Organize and host a National Research Symposium for DK-MSRP students to present their work and engage with leaders in diabetes research; 4) Develop networking skills and coaching for career development of DK-MSRSP students to nurture future researchers in diabetes, obesity, and metabolism; 5) Develop a social media platform to track students, monitor program outcomes, and create resources for trainees' continued involvement in clinical and research careers in diabetes. Thus the DK-MSRP generates significant enthusiasm about diabetes research and creates momentum toward a research career and is a key example of NIDDK-supported Diabetes Research Centers and other NIDDK programs working together to train future leaders."
"9458729","The mission of the Stable Isotope & Metabolomics Core (SIMC) is to provide guided metabolite and substrate  flux determinations in complex in vivo metabolic rodent models and for human clinical investigation for  members of the Einstein-Mount Sinai Diabetes Research Center (ES-DRC). The SIMC provides an array of in  vitro metabolic methodologies that augment in vivo investigations. These services provide investigators with  specialized assays to determine substrate flux dynamics and metabolite profiles at the organelle, cellular,  tissue and whole body level thereby elucidating the integrative network of disorders in glucose, protein and  lipid metabolism. Through these collaborative efforts with the other Cores of the ES-DRC, the effects of defined  pharmacological, dietary, environmental and genetic alterations are thoroughly characterized for their effects  on glucose and lipid homeostasis, insulin action, and metabolism. The role of candidate molecules in relevant  tissues (i.e., neurons, hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, adipocytes and beta cells) that are related to glucose  homeostasis can be specifically delineated by thorough and definitive analyses using in vivo and in vitro  experimentation with a step-wise guided approach in rodents and humans as well as in cell lines. To  accomplish these goals, the SIMC will: 1) perform in vivo stable isotope substrate flux assays for the  determination of rates of protein synthesis, lipogenesis, peripheral glucose disposal, hepatic glucose recycling,  glucose-glycerol cycling and glucose-lactate cycling; 2) determine glycolysis (extracellular acidification rates)  and mitochondrial oxygen consumption (mitochondrial respiration) in isolated cells, tissue explants or tissue  culture, using Seahorse Biosciences Flux Analyzers, as well as more comprehensive stable isotope flux  assessments; 3) perform targeted hypothesis-driven assessments of plasma and tissue metabolite profiles for  key metabolites in the glycolytic/gluconeogenic, pentose phosphate, and tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle pathways,  and lipid metabolism, including fatty acid, fatty acyl CoA and fatty acyl carnitine profiles; 4) provide mentorship  and assistance with protocol development , which uses mass spectrometer-based flux and metabolite profiling  methods for the evaluation of molecular biochemical targets relevant to the control of glucose and fatty acid  homeostasis; and 5) coordinate these efforts with other ES-DRC and Institutional Core facilities at Einstein and  Mount Sinai.

"9472878","Project 4: Neuroprotection and neuroinflammation induced by the complement proteins and receptors  In order to increase the successful identification of novel therapeutic targets for degenerative disorders  commonly seen in the elderiy, the interrelations between new discoveries in genetics (GWAS identified risk  association genes), cell biology (autophagy), immunology (inflammasomes) and neurobiology must be  delineated using a combination of experimental approaches. One rapidly emerging area is the link between  the immune system and cellular homeostasis in neurobiological systems, consistent with a role for the  immune system components in normal and pathological brain function. The complement system is a  powerful effector mechanism of the innate immune system that contributes to protection from infection and  resolution of injury. Complement component deposition has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD),  macular degeneration, Parkinson's disease and other age-related neurodegenerative disorders. While the  activation of the complement cascade may be detrimental in these diseases, C l q , the initiator molecule of  the classical complement pathway, has anti-inflammatory effects in the absence of the other components of  the complement system. Unexpectedly, it has become apparent that in the brain C l q synthesis is induced in  response to a variety of insults and injury initially in the absence of synthesis of other complement  components. In addition, our lab made the novel observation that in vitro C l q improves neuronal survival  under nutrient stressed conditions and suppresses amyloid beta-induced neuronal death suggesting that  C l q may have a neuroprotective role. This novel neuroprotection triggered by C l q was associated with  induction of expression of neuronal genes which if suppressed abrogated the C l q neuroprotective effects.  Here we will collaborate with other members of the Program Project to identify the mechanisms of this C l q  neuroprotection/survival, determine if this coordinates with a GWAS identified risk polymorphism in CRI, and  create new animal models to elucidate the significance of this pathway in in vivo models of  neurodegenerative diseases in aging populations. The molecular delineation of this novel pathway should  uncover a number of potential therapeutic targets which have not been explored which can then be  translated into innovative strategies (perhaps in combination with other therapeutic targets) in the clinic for  the enhancement of neuron survival to improve the quality of life for individuals suffering from  neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental disorders.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project will identify key signaling pathways and molecular interactions that are required for a novel  neuroprotection mechanism discovered in our laboratory and determine if this pathway improves neuronal survival  in an animal model of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In a complementary approach the biological basis of the AD risk  association of a polymorphism in an immune regulatory protein, CRI, will be determined. These results will  provide the first step in design of novel pharmacologic interventions for degenerative diseases in humans."
"9607347","Deciphering neural coding will require deconstructing the complex and intertwined signaling mechanisms that drive cellular excitability, synaptic plasticity, and circuit dynamics in the brain. This fundamental objective has been extremely challenging because unraveling the temporal and spatial interactions of multiple signaling pathways requires coordinated observation of multiple networks within individual cells and multiple neurons within intact circuits. Large gaps in knowledge remain because our current tools for tracking the dynamics of molecular activity are poorly suited for investigating more than one reporter at a time. Here, we propose to tackle this constraint through development of a novel methodology for simultaneous optical imaging of multiple quantitative FRET biosensors within single neurons, using FLuorescence Anisotropy Reporters (FLAREs). Numerous FLAREs targeting canonical signaling pathways, including calcium, cAMP, and the MAPK cascade, have been constructed in several colors allowing simultaneous imaging of up to three sensors in a single preparation, either in the same or complimentary pathways. We propose three aims to validate and further develop this technology to tailor it for studying cells and circuitry in acute and cultured slices from the mouse brain during neural coding. We will first adapt an optical sectioning microscopy method that is highly advantageous for fluorescence polarization imaging, known as dual-inverted Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (diSPIM), for FLARE imaging. We will also expand the FLARE palette to include key regulators of synaptic function (Rac, CaMKII) and membrane excitability (voltage). Construction of the FLARE-SPIM instrument will enable proof of principle studies on two high-value neuronal circuits. First, pushing the limits of subcellular spatial resolution, FLARE-SPIM imaging will be performed on key signaling molecules in single dendritic spines in acute hippocampal brain slices during induction of long-term potentiation. Second, pushing the limits of cellular temporal resolution, we will track the rhythmic fluctuations of voltage, calcium, PKA and ERK activities during circadian oscillations of neuronal activity exhibited in organotypically-cultured suprachiasmatic nucleus brain slices. Together, these studies will lay the foundation for systematic exploration of neuromodulation within cells and neuronal circuitry, providing critical and unprecedented new insights for the spatial and temporal interactions between signaling pathways. Through collaboration with other Brain Initiative groups working on similar problems, this foundational work will be scalable to add suites of sensors that visualize nodes of coordinated cellular activity and reveal and measure the complexity of neural coding within intact brain circuits."
"9454573","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Airie Kim is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician who is greatly interested in the pathophysiology of sepsis and overwhelming inflammation in intensive care units (ICUs). One facet of this problem that is particularly amenable to laboratory study is anemia of inflammation (AI), a prevalent condition with strongly associated morbidities and mortality. Her long-term goal is to become an expert and academic leader in the field of AI, and eventually in other inflammation-related aspects of critical illness She will be supported by her primary mentor, Dr. Tomas Ganz, a leader in the field of anemia and iron metabolism, as well as her co- mentors and advisors who will provide their multidisciplinary expertise in training Dr. Kim in the theoretical and technical aspects of hematopoiesis and inflammation. Through UCLA's Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI), Dr. Kim will have access to numerous career development seminars that address such topics as grant writing, manuscript preparation, and ethical research. She will also take graduate courses to obtain further training in immunology, pharmacology, hematopoiesis, and biostatistics. Dr. Kim is fortunate to have the full support of her institution, as well as the man advantages of carrying out her research project at UCLA, a renowned research center. This proposal outlines a 5-year research and career development plan that will prepare Dr. Kim to become an independent physician-scientist engaged in high-level scientific research. This project aims to elucidate the mechanisms of acute and severe AI, and to test novel therapies and their mechanisms of action in a mouse model. Dr. Kim recently characterized a mouse model of AI induced by heat-killed Brucella abortus (BA) that mimics the characteristics of human ICU anemia, including rapid onset, hypoferremia despite preserved iron stores, shortened erythrocyte lifespan, and depressed erythropoiesis. Using the BA mouse model of AI, Specific Aim 1a seeks to comprehensively investigate the underlying mechanisms, including potential contributions of reduced erythropoietin (EPO) production, decreased EPO receptor activity, and altered erythropoietic differentiation. One specific inflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in the development of AI is interferon-? (IFN-?). Using IFN-?R1-/- mice, Specific Aim 1b seeks to examine the mechanisms of IFN-? involvement in erythroid progenitor differentiation, macrophage activation, and erythrocyte lifespan. Two promising candidates for the treatment of AI are an orally bioavailable prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor that has been shown to improve anemia in patients with chronic renal failure, and erythroferrone (ERFE), a hormone newly identified by Dr. Kim's group that is induced by EPO and suppresses hepcidin expression. For Specific Aim 2a, Dr. Kim will test the PHD inhibitor in the BA mouse model in order to investigate its mechanistic and potential therapeutic effects in acute and severe inflammatory anemia. For Specific Aim 2b, Dr. Kim will use murine recombinant ERFE in the BA mouse model in order to investigate the effects on erythropoiesis and recovery in acute and severe AI. This project seeks to answer important mechanistic questions about AI, and investigate the use of novel therapies. With this work, Dr. Kim aims to advance our knowledge and potential treatments of the common but poorly understood condition of ICU anemia."
"9632239","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the most common disorder of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), affecting 400-600 per million people in various populations. It is caused by autoantibodies against muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is critical for Agrin-induced AChR concentration at the NMJ. However, some MG patients do not carry AChR or MuSK antibodies (Abs) (hereafter referred to as double seronegative MG, DNMG). The pathological mechanisms of DNMG are not well understood, leaving a void that hinders diagnosis and efficient treatment of inflicted patients. Recent studies including ours demonstrate that Agrin and LRP4 Abs are present in DNMG patients, identifying potential pathological mechanisms. However, the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. The prevalence of the Abs in DNMG is either unknown or extremely variable in the literature. Due to limited number of DNMG patients and inconsistent inclusion criteria and limited patient follow-up in previous studies, little is known about epidemiology and clinical features of Agrin or LRP4 Ab+ MG. Whether and how these Abs are pathogenic remain poorly understood. In this study, we will collaborate with 27 MG Centers in the United States that routinely see > 4,500 MG patients including 789 DNMG. We will determine the prevalence of Agrin and LRP4 Abs in this large cohort of DNMG patients and characterize the epidemiology, clinical feature and responses to treatments of DNMG patients with Agrin and LRP4 Abs. We will determine whether Agrin and LRP4 Abs are pathogenic and investigate molecular and cellular pathological mechanisms of Agrin and LRP4 Abs. This multicenter proposal will allow us to identify two new causes for MG. It will provide valuable information regarding the prevalence of Agrin and LRP4 Abs in DNMG patients, the epidemiology of these new forms of MG and association with clinical features, severity, diagnostic tests and responses to treatments, and pathological mechanisms. It will contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies against this devastating disease."
"9454466","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Diabetes Prevention Program was a landmark randomized controlled trial that demonstrated the efficacy of a structured and comprehensive lifestyle intervention in preventing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Due to its large success, it was adapted for use in community settings by changing the intensive, individualized (one-on- one) lifestyle intervention to a facilitated, group-based intervention (Group Lifestyle Balance? [GLB]). While the GLB program has been associated with modest improvements in weight management and a reduced incidence of T2D in various community-based settings, reach has been limited. Healthcare system settings hold great potential for implementing behavioral lifestyle interventions due to the clinical resources and access to patients at risk for T2D. Natural experiments resulting from the spontaneous and organic implementation of evidence-based interventions, such as GLB, into a real-world clinical practice provide a rare and exciting opportunity to examine effectiveness in a truly pragmatic context.  In the proposed study, Evaluation of a Lifestyle Intervention Adopted for Clinical Practice for Diabetes Prevention (ELEVATE-DP), we seek to evaluate the GLB program after its integration within a large, healthcare delivery system, Sutter Health (SH) of Northern California. SH is a mixed payer environment and operates as a fee-for-service organization, much like the U.S. healthcare system as a whole. In 2010, two of the five regional affiliates independently launched GLB programs. This allows for the unique opportunity to rigorously evaluate the real-world effectiveness of the GLB program after integration within a healthcare system, with high potential for the generalizability of findings to other similar health systems in the U.S. This study will employ a rigorous mixed-methods evaluation approach, using a large, comprehensive electronic health records (EHR) system, GLB program records, and prospectively collected primary data from past and present GLB administrators, facilitators, and participants, as well as eligible non-participants. We will use the EHR to retrospectively identify GLB participants (N=5,000) and a matched usual-care cohort (non-GLB participants; N=10,000) between 2010 and 2016, and will add four years of additional data (2017-2020). The Specific Aims are to: 1) Evaluate the clinical effectiveness of GLB relative to usual-care; 2) Evaluate the impact of GLB on healthcare resource utilization and costs relative to usual-care, including a formal cost-effectiveness analysis; and 3) Evaluate the implementation and fidelity of GLB within and across SH regional divisions and clinics using a comparative mixed-methods process evaluation. This study will identify important barriers to and facilitators of translating an efficacious diabetes prevention intervention into routine clinical practice, outside of a research setting."
"9559508","Osteocytes play a critical role in bone homeostasis by regulating the production and activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts; but less is known about osteocyte function in bone pathophysiology. Work by the PI during the previous funding period of this Merit award showed that activation of parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R) signaling in osteocytes inhibits the expression of Sost/sclerostin, the osteocyte-derived inhibitor of bone formation, and increases in osteocytes the expression of RANKL, the master inducer of osteoclast differentiation. Moreover, deletion of PTH-regulated domains in the RANKL promoter abolished resorption driven by PTH1R activation in osteocytes. Further, mice with osteocytic deletion of PTH1R exhibit decreased resorption and defective anabolic response to PTH. Work leading to this application also established that mice with diabetes mellitus induced by streptozotocin (S-DM) exhibit low bone mass and inferior mechanical and material properties; increased resorption, decreased formation, and increased bone marrow adipocytes (BMAT); as well as increased osteocyte apoptosis and high expression of Sost/sclerostin. Further, treatment of S-DM mice with a PTH related protein (PTHrP)-derived peptide (1-37), which acts through the PTH1R, corrected these changes, and activated survival signaling preventing osteocyte apoptosis. The long term goal of this research is to determine the potential of targeting osteocytes and their products for treating bone maladies. The specific goal of this proposal is to unveil the mechanisms underlying protection of skeletal deterioration by PTH1R signaling in DM. We hypothesize that PTH1R signaling in osteocytes activated by PTH or abaloparatide (FDA-approved bone anabolic agents) counteracts the damaging actions of DM in bone by regulating osteocyte-derived factors, thus maintaining bone mass and strength, preserving osteocyte viability, and reducing BMAT. This hypothesis will be tested using two murine models of established type 1 and type 2 DM, S-DM and high fat diet (HFD-DM), associated with low versus high insulinemia, respectively, and using pharmacologic and genetic tools to activate or inhibit PTH1R signaling, and to interfere with osteocytic gene products. We will pursue the following aims: Aim 1 will examine whether pharmacologic activation of PTH1R signaling with PTH or abaloparatide restores bone mass and strength in S-DM or HFD-DM mice (in inbred C57BL/6 and outbred Swiss Webster strains); and reveal underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Aim 2 will examine osteocyte contribution to PTH1R signaling protective action on DM bone disease, by investigating the effect of PTH or abaloparatide in S-DM, HFD-DM and control mice with deletion of the PTH1R in osteocytes (DMP1-8kb-Cre). And Aim 3 will examine the role of osteocyte-derived Wnt/?catenin antagonists on the skeletal deterioration induced by S-DM or HFD- DM, by investigating whether mice lacking Sost, Dkk1, or both in osteocytes (Sostf/f; Dkk1f/f; DMP1-8kb-Cre) or mice expressing the LRP5 high bone mass mutation pG171V (resistant to Sost- and Dkk1-mediated inhibition of Wnt-?catenin signaling) are protected from S-DM and HFD-DM induced effects on bone."
"9463456","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)          This is a competing continuation for the Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET), the P30 Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC) at the University of Pennsylvania. The Center is comprised of 61 members from 20 Departments and 6 Schools, with equal representation of basic and clinician scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists places the CEET in a strong position to conduct high-impact, translational EHS research. The CEET is the only EHS CC in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and has built a research agenda that is responsive to the environmental health needs of the region knowing that the solutions can be translated elsewhere. The CEET mission is to elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national  and global communities. Our theme in Translational Environmental Health will be accomplished as follows. The CEET will utilize its affinity group structure in Lung and Airway Disease to address diseases associated with poor air quality, ozone, PM2.5 and asbestos exposure; in Oxidative Stress and Oxidative Stress Injury to elucidate how environmental exposures exacerbate oxidative stress and inflammation; in Reproduction, Endocrinology & Development to determine how environmental exposures act at windows of susceptibility to cause defects from conception to adulthood; and in Gene-Environment Interactions to determine how environmental exposures confer disease risk due to differences in genotype and epigenotype. Translation of these findings on an individual bases will lead to Precision Environmental Medicine (PREEM). The CEET builds integrated research teams to study topics that transcend affinity group (e.g. endocrine disrupting chemicals and epigenetics) and translational research teams to tackle environmental health challenges identified by its Community Outreach and Engagement Core (e.g. asbestos exposure in Ambler) with the goal of disseminating findings back to the affected communities. The CEET provides the tools required for PREEM by maintaining an Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core for human subject studies, a Translational Biomarker Core to measure biomarkers of exposure and effect, and a CEET Informatics Core to integrate omics data to capture the exposome. The CEET builds capacity in EHS by funding pilot-projects and career development. This structure enables the CEET to inform the decisions of policy makers and to improve public health in the citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania now and in the future."
"9469877","Platelets play an important role in the initiation and propagation of atherosclerosis and, more so, in the ensuing atherothrombotic complications. Although the standard antiplatelet drugs reduce the risk of atherothrombotic complications in high-risk patients, they are not very effective in diabetes mellitus (DM) subjects. The reasons for this remains unclear but likely due to increased production/release of reticulated platelets (RP) from the bone marrow (BM). The RPs are immature, larger in size, hyperreactive, and less responsive to standard anti- platelet drugs. Platelet production is tightly regulated by the hormone thrombopoietin (TPO) and its receptor, c- MPL, which is found on several BM progenitor cells. While TPO is constitutively produced from BM stromal cells and the kidney, the liver becomes their major source during inflammation where hepatic TPO production is increased through the actions of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Our preliminary data suggests that hyperglycemia enhances platelet biogenesis via mechanisms that involve neutrophil-derived S100A8/A9, a Damage Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP) complex, Kupffer cell (KC)-derived interleukin-6 (IL-6), and hepatic TPO. Studies in humans have also found a positive correlation between plasma S100A8/A9, IL-6, and platelet aggregation. Most importantly increased serum S100A8/A9 is associated with reduced anti-platelet effects of aspirin. Based on our preliminary data and the clinical evidence, we hypothesize that hyperglycemia-induced IL-6 production from hepatic KCs elevates plasma TPO and initiate thrombocytopoiesis resulting in higher proportion of RPs in the blood. The newly formed RPs, being hyperreactive, enhance platelet-leukocyte interactions and contribute to atherothrombotic complications. In order to test this hypothesis, firstly, we will examine how glucose enhances the production of RPs in diabetes. We will specifically identify the cross talk between circulating neutrophils and KCs by manipulating blood glucose, neutrophils, serum S100A8/A9 and RAGE/IL6 signaling in KCs and study how these manipulations affect RP production. Secondly, we will assess the atherogenic and thrombogenic properties of RPs in diabetes by performing various platelet function assays both in mice and type 2 DM subjects. The findings from these studies will have a broader impact on the current anti-platelet therapy particularly in DM subjects as there is a great potential for discovery of novel targets to treat cardiovascular disease."
"9461560","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Signaling through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has critical roles in development and in diseases such as cancer. All ligands of the EGFR are made as membrane-anchored precursors whose ectodomain must be proteolytically released or shed to trigger EGFR-signaling. EGFR-ligand shedding is therefore crucial for EGFR-signaling. The membrane-anchored metalloproteinase ADAM17 has emerged as the principal regulator of the bioavailability of EGFR-ligands. Mice lacking ADAM17 phenotypically resemble those lacking the EGFR, providing genetic evidence for the essential role of ADAM17 in EGFR signaling and establishing ADAM17 as an important potential target for the treatment of EGFR-dependent cancers. ADAM17 activity is highly regulated and is influenced by numerous signaling pathways. How these pathways functionally intersect with ADAM17 and how ADAM17 is activated are key questions that are the subject of this application. Previously, we had found that ADAM17 is regulated by its transmembrane domain (TMD), but the underlying mechanism remained enigmatic. In a major breakthrough in the last funding period, we identified the seven-membrane spanning iRhoms1 and 2 (iR1, iR2) as novel regulators of ADAM17. We showed that iR2 controls the maturation and function of ADAM17 in immune cells, and that inactivation of iR1 and iR2 abolishes all functions of ADAM17 in mice, thereby providing biochemical, cell biological and genetic evidence that iR1 and iR2 are the long sought-after regulators of ADAM17. The main goals of the current proposal are to understand how iR1 and 2 integrate and interpret the signals that drive the activation of the ADAM17/EGFR pathway and to understand the functional consequences of these interactions in the context of ADAM17-dependent pathological neovascularization. We propose the following specific aims:  Aim 1 is focused on understanding how iR1 and iR2 interact with and regulate ADAM17, with an emphasis on the TMD and juxtamembrane domains of both interacting partners. In addition, we will characterize the intracellular maturation and subcellular localization of the iR2/ADAM17 complex. The main goal of aim 2 is to understand how the C-terminal TMDs of iR1 and 2 control their substrate selectivity and to identify what makes a substrate such as HB-EGF selective for iR2. Moreover, we will search for cytoplasmic proteins that interact with and regulate iR2/ADAM17 but cannot bind to the iR2-cub cytoplasmic deletion mutant that inactivates iR2/ADAM17, and will combine these efforts with an analysis of iR1-/-iR2-cub mice. Finally, aim 3 will rigorously test the role of the iR1/2/ADAM17 signaling axis in the context of pathological angiogenesis in mouse models for cancer and proliferative eye diseases.  Together, these aims will resolve the most pressing current questions regarding the regulation of ADAM17, a major cellular sheddase that is a critical molecule in EGFR signaling and a target for treatment of cancer, by the newly discovered upstream regulators iR1 and iR2."

The Core will administer the CFAR's pilot grant program, conduct mentoring and career development of young investigators, and provide seminars and scientific symposia that create an outstanding scientific and intellectual environment for HIV/AIDS research at the UR. The Core will use its pilot program to support young faculty and to also promote overall CFAR objectives, including the establishment of new multidisciplinary collaborations and the promotion of innovative studies that support the mission of the CFAR's Scientific Working Groups (SWGs) and leverage unique institutional assets. During our funding cycle as a Developmental CFAR (D-CFAR), this Core has funded 26 pilot awards in an aggregate amount of $641,606, which have yielded a 10:1 return on investment in terms of new grant awards. Its pilot and mentoring programs have also had a profound impact on the career development of young HIV/AIDS researchers. This has included 2 KL2 awards from the UR CTSI; 2 awards from the national Creative New Ideas in HIV Research (CNIHR) program (out of only 22 total awards made between 2010 and 2012); 4 CFAR supplement awards in 2011 (including 1 of only 2 nanotech supplements awarded nationally); and the academic promotion of 6 young faculty members. Three Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will stimulate new research on HIV/AIDS by funding pilot awards targeted to: young faculty members; innovative studies with potential for high impact; and multidisciplinary collaborations that span different departments and schools, including projects that leverage unique institutional assets. Aim 2 will provide comprehensive, structured mentoring support for the early career development of young faculty, and a grant pre-review service intended to enhance the quality of extramural grant applications from new investigators.

"9461610","Project 1 (P1) provides molecular tests at the cell type-specific level for the following aspects of the Central  Hypothesis: 1) a core cortical pathology in schizophrenia affects layer 3 pyramidal cells, and 2) the impact of  this pathology on gene expression is moderated by factors that differ across cortical regions. Layer 3  pyramidal cells will be collected using laser microdissection in postmortem samples from subjects with  schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and healthy comparison subjects (Aim 1). Within-region analyses  will inform on the cell autonomous pathology of layer 3 pyramidal cells in schizophrenia. Across-region  analyses will characterize molecular regional specificities in control subjects and how they impact the  pathology of layer 3 pyramidal cells in schizophrenia. A secondary goal is to gain insight into potential  molecular targets to restore functional balance along the visual working memory and attention network.  Accordingly, since layer 3 pyramidal cell alterations are predicted to induce transcriptional responses in the  parvalbumin (PV)-containing GABA neurons that they innervate, similar analyses will be performed in PV  neurons (Aim 2). To provide a comprehensive molecular perspective on coordinated local circuit alterations,  expression of genes (mRNA) and gene regulatory micro-RNAs (miRNA) will be investigated in parallel (Aims  1-2) and biological modules implicated in healthy control and pathological conditions will be identified by  changes in coordinated expression across cell types, regions and cohorts (Aim 3). Results from PI will  inform all other Center projects on the molecular and cellular bases in regards to the Central Hypothesis that  regional differences moderate the serverity of layer 3 PC alterations in schizophrenia. PI will also provide  molecular leads for protein marker studies in P2, and for layer 3 PC regional differences in  electrophysiological properties in P3. Together Projects 1-3 will provide the molecular, cellular and circuitry  bases for the functional connectivity studies in monkey (P4), and in imaging studies of healthy controls and  subjects with schizophrenia (P5)."
"9497758","SUMMARY  The visceral leishmaniasis (VL) elimination strategy in the Indian subcontinent, that has a current goal of reducing the incidence of VL to below 1/10,000 people by 2017, consists of rapid detection and treatment of VL cases to reduce the number of human infection reservoirs, and vector control using indoor residual spraying (IRS). To achieve sustained elimination of VL, an appropriate surveillance program is needed to detect the emergence of insecticide resistant populations of P. argentipes, as well as studies to define the contribution of individuals from across the infection spectrum, and of possible non-human reservoirs, to the maintenance of the L. donovani transmission cycle.  To address these issues, we have proposed a series of cutting edge studies that will exploit the exceptional resources now available to carry out vector related research in Bihar. These resources include 1) a new, fully functional insectary that will permit containment, rearing, infection, and manipulation of field caught sand flies, 2) an established working colony of P. argentipes that has been certified for use in xenodiagnostic procedures, and 3) an entomological field team that has extensive experience in the capture, taxonomic identification, and colonization of sand flies in Bihar. Studies are proposed to survey insecticide resistance in field populations of P. argentipes, establish a pyrethroid resistant colony, and develop biomarker-based assays to quickly identify emergent populations of insecticide resistant sand flies in Bihar. Vector competency studies will be conducted on wild caught P. argentipes captured from different peridomestic settings and associated to their midgut microbiota profiles. Methods for metagenomic sequencing and analysis will interface with the studies of the human gut microbiome proposed in Project 1. Cultivable bacterial flora that appear to negatively or positively impact Leishmania development will be used in bacterial feeds in attempts to manipulate vector competence in colonized flies. The colonized flies will also be used in xenodiagnostic assays to identify possible non-human reservoirs that may be playing a greater role in the maintenance of the L. donovani transmission cycle as a consequence of IRS. Finally, the metabolic and immunologic profiling approaches proposed in Projects 1 & 3 will be applied to the ongoing human xenodiagnostic surveys sponsored by the Gates Foundation in attempts to identify biomarkers in plasma and localized sand fly bite sites that are associated with transmission potential in infected people."
"9490329","The mission of the Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) Program of the Penn DRC is to foster the development of new investigators and to provide seed support for innovative high-risk diabetes related projects, with an increasing emphasis on clinical and translational science. Over the past 2 funding periods (10 years), the Pilot and Feasibility Program has been highly successful in this regard. 46 investigators received P&F awards and, of these, 83% have garnered independent NIH support, the majority as R01s directly related to their P&F awards. During the previous funding period 28 traditional P&F grants were awarded among 89 applications submitted by investigators representing 27 Departments spanning multiple Schools and Institutes on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania as well as other Philadelphia Institutions. Of the funded grants, 80% were to new investigators and more than 15% were dedicated to clinical and translational projects. During the next funding period we propose to continue this core mission of the Pilot and Feasibility Program. Given the past successes of the program, the increasing cost of performing research in the setting of an ever more competitive general funding environment, and the clear need based on the steady influx of applications from both within and outside the diabetes research community, it is critical to continue the mission of the P&F Program."
"9461075","Summary Messenger RNAs are typically thought of as passive carriers of genetic information that are acted upon by protein- or small RNA-regulatory factors and by ribosomes during the process of translation. We have discovered that the 5´- untranslated regions (UTRs) of numerous bacterial mRNAs serve a more proactive role in metabolic monitoring and genetic control. RNA genetic switches called riboswitches selectively bind metabolites without the need for proteins, and subsequently modulate gene expression by several distinct mechanisms. Riboswitches exhibit striking complexity in structure and action, and our findings indicate that cells from all three domains of life use these metabolite-sensing RNAs to control fundamental metabolic pathways. Furthermore, we have evidence that riboswitches can be targeted with small compounds that disregulate gene expression and thereby function as antibiotics. We will establish the basic functions of ?orphan? riboswitches whose ligands remain mysterious. Particular emphasis will be focused on the most widespread classes of these noncoding RNAs such that our discoveries will have the greatest impact on improving our understanding of bacterial pathogens. We will also validate the functions of several new ribozyme classes. These analyses of the structural and functional characteristics of novel riboswitch and ribozyme systems are intended to establish the basic principles of riboswitch molecular recognition and function. Our findings will increase our understanding of bacterial gene control mechanisms, facilitate atomic-resolution structural analyses of riboswitch and ribozyme RNAs, and provide new targets for antimicrobial drug development."
"9442826","Complications due to infections during pregnancy are a significant risk factor for the emergence of  schizophrenia (SZ) in the offspring. Animal models of prenatal immune challenge provide support for the  idea that developmental immune abnormalities promote specific vulnerabilities of the disease. Conversion of  the amino acid tryptophan to kynurenine (KYN) and its associated metabolites (collectively referred to as  kynurenines) is one ofthe mechanisms activated during viral and bacterial infections. In particular, kynurenic  acid (KYNA) is known to have neuroactive properties and is also elevated in the cerebral cortex of SZ  patients. The purpose ofthe present project is to evaluate the involvement ofthe kynurenine system in the  established animal model of prenatal infection. The central hypothesis is that activation ofthe enzyme  indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in response to the viral RNA mimetic poly l:C in the mother leads to  increased production of kynurenines, including KYNA in the brain of embryos. This increase in KYNA will in  turn be responsible for promoting microglia to adopt an alternative activated state also known as M2  activation. It is further hypothesized that this shift in activation state will be maintained throughout  development, at least in a proportion of microglia, and that it will be exacerbated in response to stressors  resulting in enhanced production of KYNA in the brain. In concert with the central hypothesis ofthe center  grant, an increase in KYNA levels in the brain is believed to be responsible for cognitive impairments. We will  test these hypotheses using rats prenatally challenged with poly l:C and subjected to a series of studies  including a) documenting the trajectory of changes in the kynurenine pathway during pre and post- natal  brain development and in relation to microglia activation; b) evaluating peripheral and central kynurenines  and microglial responses to social stressors during peri-adolescence; and c) testing whether timed KAT II  inhibition (reduction of KYNA production) prevents and/or reverses the neurobehavioral deficits seen in peri-  adolescents. The present project will also involve the study of peripheral and placental cytokine and  kynurenine responses in the mothers, as well as peripheral and central immune responses in the offspring."
"9471383","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Two out of every three adults is overweight or obese. Overweight and obesity is associated with significant medical and psychological comorbidities. To date, the most successful weight loss treatment is behavioral weight loss (BWL), which includes nutrition and physical activity education, as well as behavior therapy techniques. Although many adults lose weight in these programs, studies suggest that one third to one half do not respond. Additionally, for those who do lose weight, weight loss maintenance becomes a significant challenge. We have developed a new model for the treatment of obesity, called Regulation of Cues (ROC), which is based on Schachter's Externality Theory. The ROC program targets two theorized mechanisms for overeating in Schachter's Theory; decreased sensitivity to appetitive cues and increased sensitivity to external food cues. We have tested the ROC model with overweight adults who binge eat in a pilot trial. Our initial data showed that participants significantly decreased their BMI during treatment and continued to decrease their BMI at the three month post-treatment time-point. The objective of this proposed study is to further evaluate the ROC program with overweight and obese adults. Considering that BWL has merit for some people, but fails to facilitate maintenance, we propose a 4 arm randomized controlled trial that will compare ROC, BWL, ROC+BWL combined and an attentional control (AC). We will recruit and randomize 280 overweight/obese adults and will assess them at baseline, mid-treatment (month 6), post-treatment (month 12), mid-follow-up (month 18) and follow-up (month 24). Primary and secondary aims are as follows. Primary Aim 1: Compare ROC and ROC+BWL to AC on body mass index (BMI), body composition, and binge eating over the course of treatment and follow-up. Primary Aim 2: Compare ROC and ROC+BWL to BWL on body mass index (BMI), body composition, and binge eating over the course of treatment and follow-up. Secondary Aim 1: Compare ROC, ROC+BWL, BWL and AC on sensitivity to appetitive cues, sensitivity to food cues, inhibition, restriction, caloric intake, overeating, and physical activity over the course of the treatment and follow-up. Exploratory aim 1: Evaluate mediators (sensitivity to appetitive cues, sensitivity to food cues, inhibition, restriction, binge eating, overeating in response to food cues) and moderators (demographics, baseline BMI, binge eating status) on BMI over time in each treatment arm. This program of research is an important next step in the development of treatments for overweight and obese people, and could change the paradigm of obesity treatment. This study will contribute to the study of basic behavioral mechanisms and food intake, could provide a novel model for the treatment of obesity, and could inform clinical decision making regarding obesity treatment."
"9548135","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Aphasia is a communication disorder that affects 80,000 people per year and estimates suggest that VHA outpatient clinics see 2000 new cases of aphasia each year. As in other healthcare disciplines, speech-language pathologists are increasingly called upon to document the impact of their interventions with respect to functioning, activities, and social participation. One response has been the development of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures for a range of health conditions. The goal of this proposal is to enhance the validity and clinically utility o a new PRO measure for veterans with aphasia, the Aphasia Communication Outcome Measure (ACOM). This tool will assist clinicians and researchers in responding to growing mandates to focus on patients' experiences in improving the quality and efficiency of care. In the initial fiel trial of the ACOM, a plausible and clinically useful measurement model for the ACOM was identified; its covariance-based reliability was estimated to be high; and it was found to correlat positively with other measures of communicative functioning and language performance as predicted. The next steps in maximizing the ACOM's clinical utility are to assess its sensitivity t change over time, the stability of its measurement model, and its relationships to other relevant variables. First, the responsiveness of the ACOM to treatment-related change will be assessed in collaboration with 3 independent VA RR&D-funded treatment studies by collecting pre- and post-treatment data from at least 60 participants to test whether the ACOM demonstrates reliable positive change in response to treatment. Estimates of its responsiveness and minimally important difference scores will be obtained. Second, confirmatory tests of the ACOM measurement model and the stability of its item parameters will be conducted in a sample of 300 participants with aphasia in order to verify that its internal structure applies to the intende population. Test-retest stability of score estimates in the absence of treatment will also be assessed this sample. Third, in a sub-sample of 240 participants with aphasia, correlations among the ACOM, a performance-based measure of language impairment, and concurrent PRO measures of communication, cognitive, and physical functioning will be estimated to evaluate convergence with more related constructs and discriminant evidence for less related constructs. We will also use data collected from this subsample to assess the unique contribution of ACOM for predicting communication-related well-being over and above a measure of language impairment and a PRO measure of general negative mood. The outcomes of this proposal will include (1) estimates of the responsiveness of the ACOM to treatment and benchmarks for interpretation, (2) evidence supporting the validity of the ACOM's internal structure and the stability of its item parameters, and (2) evidence supporting claims that the ACOM in fact measures the underlying construct of patient-reported communicative functioning."
"9494767","ABSTRACT Adipose tissue plays a critical role in regulating systemic metabolism. The adipose depots themselves are heterogeneous mixtures of cell types that include immune cells, preadipocytes, stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and others, in addition to the adipocytes themselves. The relative proportions of these cells, as well as their activation state, is known to differ following changes in nutritional state. Despite a longstanding realization that the behavior of adipose tissue is determined by interactions between the various component cell types within the fat pad, our knowledge of the identity of these cellular sub-populations is woefully incomplete. Here we propose to use single cell sequencing technology to identify novel subpopulations of cells within different adipose depots of mice and humans. We will assess how these different cells vary with sex, age, and metabolic perturbations, like fasting, high fat diet, gastric bypass, and thermal stress. Further, we will determine the activation state of these cells under these different conditions, and will utilize a variety of experimental and computational techniques to characterize the interactions that occur between cell types. The resulting database will be a community resource and the starting point for a new era of adipose tissue biology."

"9459848","To address a critical need for improved human tissue models to study infectious diseases, we propose to form   the MIT Center for Human Tissues and Infectious Diseases (MIT.HTMID). The MIT.HTMID Center will study   viral infections of the human brain and central nervous system by using biologically relevant two dimensional   (2D) human neural cells and three dimensional (3D) human cerebral organoids. The cells are homogeneous   preparations of human neuronal progenitors, neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia, derived   from embryonic stem (ES) cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), and produced in the Human Cell   and Tissue Core. Prior work has demonstrated that these cells and the organoids formed are   near­physiological in their biological functions, thereby representing an experimental system that is superior to   rodent models. The goal of Project 1, Aim 1A is to define the viral infection phenotypes for five cell types. Two   types of viruses, produced in the MIT.HTMID Virology Core, will be used. First, we will study flaviviruses,   including Dengue Fever Virus, West Nile Virus, and Zika Virus. Indeed, an important motivation for studying   human brain tissue and viruses is to understand the pathogenesis of Zika virus infections, which are causing   microcephaly and Guillain Barre syndrome worldwide. Second, we will use pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis   viruses (VSV) to study entry of several encephalitic viruses, including Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus   (EEEV), Western Equine Encephalitis Virus (WEEV) and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV). By   replacing the VSV viral envelope with that of EEEV, WEEV, or VEEV, we are able to study virus entry in the 2D   cells and 3D organoids. These experiments are highly significant  because EEEV, VEEV, and WEEV are   select agents. Using pseudotyped select viruses and multiple relevant cell types will allow us to study virus   tropism, pathology, and potential therapeutic targets. Project 1 Aim 1A will examine virus infection phenotypes?   that is, we will analyze virus replication, cell viability, spontaneous electrical activity, transcriptome and   secretome changes, and potential to differentiate to other cell types. This approach is significant because it will   demonstrate which cell types are most susceptible to virus infections, also revealing similarities and differences   among viruses that cause very different clinical diseases. In Project 1, Aim 1B, we propose to study virus   infection in the context of the three dimensional human cerebral organoid tissue model. Our group may be   unique in having the technical capacity to generate organoids that include microglia, which are the immune   cells of the brain. Our goal will be to determine if activated microglia have protective roles by secreting factors   that establish an antiviral environment. Alternatively, we will also test a hypothesis that microglia, upon   infection with Zika virus, are able to migrate into cerebral organoids to initiate cytotoxic infection of neural cell   types. These experiments are aimed at understanding how the fetal brain becomes infected by Zika virus to   cause microcephaly. The work will be facilitated greatly by forming the MIT.HTMID Center.  "
"9424651","PROJECT SUMMARY This project proposes to continue the development of AutoRegisterTM: an integrated software-based system for enhancing the accuracy of tumor change detection. The intent of the system is to automate the alignment of a patient's brain scan with that of a prior scan such that subsequent offline tumor measurements do not have error introduced solely by differing slice orientations. While similar to current technologies, such as Siemens AutoAlign, the proposed technology is not sensitive to the inherent noise of such generic, landmark-based techniques. AutoRegisterTM exemplifies personalized medicine: it uses the patient's previous data as its own reference. Additionally, the proposed technology is based upon a novel registration algorithm that is robust to atypical anatomy, such as a tumor, which often adversely affects techniques such as AutoAlign. In the United States, there are an estimated 13,000 deaths per year due to tumors in the primary central nervous system. Standard and experimental therapies rely on accurate measurement of tumor size change to assess treatment response and guide clinical decision-making during treatment and clinical trials. The project will continue to translate existing technology developed by CorticoMetrics and the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Our objectives are to: 1) create a commercial-ready, and regulatory-compliant, software medical device based on work conducted in Phase I; 2) further develop our reference integration with Siemens MRI scanners for validation, demonstration and research purposes; and 3) continue to gather validation data with the ongoing assistance of Phase I collaborators conducting imaging of glioblastoma patients, and by establishing new collaborations. AutoRegisterTM employs a novel 3D MR image registration algorithm designed by advisors Drs. Reuter and Fischl, which achieves highly accurate alignment both within-subject and within-modality, and ignores brain- imaging voxels for which no feasible matches exists due to inherent changes, such as tumor tissue and surrounding localized mass or edema effects. The co-PI on the project, Dr. van der Kouwe, is a renowned MRI head-motion correction expert and is the original creator of Siemens' AutoAlign: the closest competitor to the CorticoMetrics' AutoRegisterTM system."

"9463458","Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC) Abstract The IHSFC supports all human research in the CEET. It is the entity that permits the CEET to attain its Strategic Vision to perform translational environmental health research that will impact patients, communities, and the public. It provides highly focused transdisciplinary services including study design, enrollment of subjects, data management, access to biological samples, biostatistical analyses, interpretation of results and dissemination of results to the public through the Community Outreach and Engagement Core (COEC). Over the past four years, the IHSFC has uniquely focused on delivery of five specific services that include: human studies design and performance services, human exposure laboratories, human population exposure services, CEET virtual biorepositories, and biostatistics support for both non-genomics and genomics studies. Each service provides CEET investigators with unique tools to translate fundamental research into improvements in individual human and population-based cohorts to advance PREcision Environmental Medicine (PREEM). In a bi-directional manner, the IHSFC communicates with the COEC to formulate community-based questions and concerns into specific hypotheses for investigators with expertise in population-based studies. An important goal of the IHSFC is to promote inter-Environmental Health Science Core Center (EHS CC) collaborative projects in human subjects. Over the past four years, five interactive projects involving inter-EHS CC pilot projects or R01 equivalents have been initiated. The interaction of the IHSFC with other centers greatly extends the expertise to a network of EHS CCs to address inter-center human research. As described in the Strategic Vision, the IHSFC supports integrated research themes in humans that transcend affinity groups and the formation of translational research teams that involve CEET investigators and COEC members to address community-based questions."
"9653882","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Heart attack and stroke, which together are called cardiovascular disease, cause over 1/3 of all deaths in VA patients. The current guidelines for the prevention of these conditions focus on lowering patients' blood pressure and cholesterol levels. A new treatment strategy, which I call benefit-based tailored treatment, that instead guides treatment decisions based on the likelihood that a medication would prevent a heart attack or stroke could prevent more cardiovascular disease, with lower medication use, and be more patient centered. The purpose of this Career Development Award is to develop and assess tools and approaches that could enable the implementation of benefit-based tailored treatment of cardiovascular disease, in particular a decision support tool and educational program for clinicians and a performance profiling system. The decision support tool will enable better care by showing clinicians patient-specific estimates of the likelihood that their medication decisions will prevent a cardiovascular disease event. The performance profiling system will encourage better care by assessing the quality of care provided at VA sites and in PACT teams based on how well the medical care provided follows this treatment strategy. The project will have three aims. Aim 1: In the first aim, I will seek to understand clinicians' and patients' perceptions of and receptivity to the use of benefit-based tailored treatment for cardiovascular disease. Information gained from qualitative research with clinicians will help assess and improve the usability and effectiveness of the decision support tool and educational program for clinicians, along with the acceptability of the treatment strategies in general. Information gained from focus groups with patients will help learn their priorities in cardiovascular disease prevention, to help identify ways to make the interventions and their assessments more patient-centered. Aim 2: In the second aim, the decision support tool and educational program will be assessed in a real-world randomized pilot study involving thirty clinicians. Half of the clinicians will be provided the decision support tool and education intervention for ten patients each, the other half will receive a traditional quality improvement program and treatment reminders. The study will have formative goals of ensuring that clinicians and patients believe the tool is valuable and does not disrupt care processes or workflow for anyone in the PACT team. This will be studied with qualitative and survey assessments. The primary summative outcome will be the influence of the intervention on clinicians' treatment decisions. Secondary outcomes will assess patients' satisfaction with their visits and their clinicians. Aim 3: The third aim will develop and evaluate a novel performance measurement system based on benefit- based tailored treatment. First, the performance profiling system will be developed. Then the profiling system's ability to reliably differentiate high quality from low-quality care will be evaluated."

"9437793","Project Summary The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease is estimated to be as high as 20% in the United States, and up to 50% of these patients remain symptomatic on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Unfortunately, the clinical approach to understand the mechanism of nonresponse is not standardized, and patients will often undergo various esophageal function tests: 1) pH-impedance, 2) wireless pH monitoring over 96 hours, 3) high-resolution impedance manometry (HRIM), and 4) mucosal impedance. Currently significant controversy exists regarding the best technique, optimal study protocol and treatment approach for the PPI non-responder (PPINR) group, resulting in inappropriate resource utilization and a failure to provide effective personalized care. As such, PPINRs contribute to a large healthcare burden in the United States. The first aim of our study is to identify the relevant physiologic parameters of the aforementioned diagnostic tools in their ability to predict PPI requirement. Subsequently, in aim two these results will be applied to guide the formal development of a clinical algorithm for the management of PPINRs with personalized clinical pathways based on mechanism of treatment failure. We will first perform a prospective comparison trial of 240 PPINR subjects at two centers over a 4 year period. Subjects will complete symptom questionnaires and undergo diagnostic testing (pH-impedance on PPI therapy, HRIM, 96-hour wireless pH monitoring off of PPI therapy and mucosal impedance). Those who have a positive pH study and/or resume PPI therapy will receive escalation of acid suppression therapy with dexlansoprazole. Experiments 1a & 1b will compare the ability of 96-hour wireless pH monitoring vs pH impedance to predict PPI requirement and response to dexlansoprazole, respectively.  Experiment 1c will explore whether mucosal impedance is equivalent to 96-hour wireless pH monitoring in predicting PPI requirement. Lastly, Experiment 1d will determine whether HRIM metrics can be utilized to determine reflux burden, mechanism and response to treatment. Next, we will develop quality measures for reflux testing in order to develop a simplified management strategy for the PPINR group. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Methodology will be utilized with an expert working group to develop formal validated quality measures for reflux testing based on results from aim 1 in addition to the available literature & evidence. This will be conducted over twelve-months (years 4 to 5)."
"9495591","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Objectives: The objectives are to understand the mechanisms that maintain medial-lateral (ML) balance during stance and walking gait and how age affects these mechanisms. The focus is on ML balance because previous evidence indicates that stability is more problematic in the ML direction than in the anterior-posterior direction and that a sizable proportion of falls in older individuals occur in the ML direction. Based on preliminary results, an additional objective is to begin prototype development of a balance aid that could potentially improve balance during gait and reduce the likelihood of falls in subjects with deficits that affect balance. Plan: The proposa includes 4 Aims, three of which investigate different aspects of the neural control of balance during gait and one Aim that proposes to apply results from the other Aims to explore development of a prosthesis to improve stability during gait. The neural control of balance during gait requires the regulation of two different aspects of movement. The first aspect involves the mechanism that controls body orientation in space and relative to the environment. This aspect requires the integration of information from multiple sensory systems (visual, vestibular, proprioceptive, and somatosensory) and the subsequent generation of appropriate motor actions that maintain a desired body posture. Aim 1 will characterize the multi-sensory influences on orientation control during gait, will compare them to results from stance, and will determine how age influences these orientation control mechanisms. The second aspect of balance control during gait involves mechanisms that maintain dynamic balance. Dynamic balance refers to the oscillating pattern of body motion that occurs with each step cycle. Multiple  control mechanisms are potential contributors to dynamic balance, including a mechanism based on the regulation of step timing. This step-timing mechanism is not currently recognized as a major contributor to dynamic balance, but our preliminary results reveal its importance. Aim 2 experiments will characterize the mechanisms contributing to dynamic balance and determine the influence of age on these mechanisms. Aim 3 will primarily determine whether gait measures obtained using our proposed methods correspond to gait measures obtained by conventional methods. Aim 4 will explore development of a balance aid to improve balance during gait by triggering stepping based on measures of body motion. Methods: Participants will be recruited primarily from an existing NCRAR database of volunteers who have expressed willingness to participate in research projects at NCRAR. At least 50% of the subjects in this database are Veterans. Subject groups will include young Veterans (ages 18 to 45 years) and older Veterans (>65 years) with 20 subjects in each group. Subjects will fill out screening questionnaires that provide a self- rating of balance confidence and have been shown to correlate with clinical examinations that predict the likelihood of falls. Aim 1 and 2 experiments will be performed on a custom balance test device that can deliver controlled disturbances by tilting the platform surface or the visual scene viewed by the subject. Participants either stand on the platform surface or perform a stepping-in-place gait that has similar characteristics, in terms of ML balance control, as a normal walking gait. Recorded data include body sway measures, platform forces, step width, timing of steps, and actual surface and visual scene motion. Aims 3 and 4 will use galvanic vestibular stimulation to perturb balance during walking. Data analysis will quantify body sway measures, identify stimulus-response relationships, and identify the contributions of different mechanisms for dynamic balance control. Existing mathematical models of balance during stance and during gait will be combined to account for experimental data such that identified model parameters are physiologically meaningful and also provide outcome measures for comparison across age groups. Statistical comparison between results from younger and older adults will determine the extent to which age influences balance during gait."
"9559797","Tularemia is a potentially fatal disease and the causative agent, Francisella tularensis (Ft), is one of few bacterial pathogens that can infect both neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes, PMNs) and macrophages. Notably, macrophages and neutrophils appear to play distinctly different roles in tularemia pathogenesis, with macrophages acting as major vehicles for bacterial growth and dissemination, and PMNs playing a central role in host tissue destruction. Neutrophils are short lived, and unlike other leukocytes are preprogrammed to undergo apoptosis 24 h after release into the circulation. Tight spatial and temporal control of this process is critical for elimination of infection and resolution of inflammation, and for this reason defects in PMN turnover exemplify a dysregulated and ineffective inflammatory response that promotes tissue destruction and disease. In keeping with this, we discovered that Ft inhibits human neutrophil apoptosis and markedly prolongs cell lifespan, and demonstrated that this is achieved via effects on the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways, as well as changes in the neutrophil transcriptome that include significant differential expression of 365 unique genes linked to apoptosis and cell fate. Nevertheless, how cell lifespan is prolonged is only partially understood. Herein, we propose groundbreaking studies based on our discovery of neutrophil metabolic reprogramming as a new mechanism for apoptosis inhibition. Our proposed studies are supported by extensive preliminary data, and are highly innovative, as integrated manipulation of glycolysis and organelle function has not been previously documented as a mechanism for regulation of PMN lifespan during infection. Potential effects of these changes on bacterial growth and the influence of PMN metabolites on macrophage polarization will also be determined. In addition, we recently identified bacterial lipoproteins (BLPs) as active factors in Ft conditioned medium (CM) that extend PMN lifespan via a mechanism that is dependent on a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in human TLR1 (rs5743618, T1805G) that significantly influences the severity and lethality of sepsis as well as the outcomes of many infectious and inflammatory diseases, including but not limited to tuberculosis, pyelonephritis, atherosclerosis, arthritis, lupus, colitis, and cancer. Elucidating the mechanism(s) of BLP and TLR2/1-driven apoptosis inhibition is a second objective of this study. Our experimental design will also utilize drugs that specifically target HIF-1? and TLR2, mitophagy, glycolysis or other relevant signaling intermediates to identify points for therapeutic intervention that are expected to be relevant to many diseases that affect Veterans. Our specific aims are: 1) To elucidate the mechanisms and functional consequences of neutrophil metabolic reprogramming. 2) To elucidate the mechanisms of BLP and TLR2/1-mediated apoptosis inhibition and potential for theraputic intervention."
"9502062","Background. Employee burnout is a significant problem which affects up to half of VA providers and staff. Burnout has been associated with a wide range of negative individual and work-related outcomes, and negatively impacts patient care. The available evidence in support of therapy animals and their effect on employee morale is promising, and indicates that such arrangements effectively reduce employee stress, improve affect, promote overall health, reduce absenteeism, and positively effect productivity levels, quality of work, morale, and job satisfaction. Despite the highly promising application of therapy animals as a way to improve employee morale and well-being, studies examining the impacts of having therapy animals in work settings are sparse, and this type of program has never been studied in a health care setting.  Specific Aims. The overall objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the use of an animal therapy program to improve well-being among VA health care providers and staff from a local VA Women's Health clinic, allowing us to examine the process and preliminary outcomes associated with the program across a range of clinical and non-clinical disciplines to inform the development of a larger trial. Specific Aims are to: (1) Assess the feasibility of developing and integrating an animal therapy program in a VA health care setting. (2) Examine the acceptability of offering an animal therapy program for VA providers and staff. (3) Gather preliminary data about the potential effectiveness and economic impacts of the animal therapy program on provider and staff employment-related outcomes to inform the development of a larger trial.  Significance. If this study finds that an animal therapy program is feasible and acceptable to VA employees, it will provide a novel and innovative approach to address a top priority of the VA ? bolstering employee wellness and reducing burnout.  Innovation. Despite the promising potential of animal therapy programs to improve employee well-being, to our knowledge, this type of program has never been offered to VA healthcare team members (either clinical or non-clinical) and no research on the topic has been conducted.  Methods. Eligible participants will comprise the 33 providers and staff working in the Women's Health Clinic. Before implementing the animal therapy program, we will field an online survey with these employees to gather information needed to refine and finalize the logistics of the program and collect baseline data on employee outcomes (burnout, stress, turnover intention, empathy). We anticipate that a therapy dog and handler pair will visit the clinic for 2 hours at a time, every other week, for 3 months (6 visits). Feasibility, acceptability and cost data will be assessed via a focus group conducted during the Women's Health Clinic team meeting most closely following the completion of the animal therapy program, semi-structured interviews with a sub-set of employees who participated in the program and dog handlers who facilitated the program, and post- implementation online surveys; surveys will also include post-program measures of employee outcomes.  Expected Results. We expect to find that participation in the animal therapy program will be high and the program well-received by VA employees. We anticipate that logistical issues will be worked out, any workflow concerns identified will be addressed, and that the program will have very low associated costs. We hypothesize that participating in the animal therapy program will result in better employment-related outcomes (e.g., stress, burnout, turnover intention, empathy) among providers and staff.  Next Step(s). Results from this pilot project will provide preliminary data to inform a larger intervention study examining the implementation and effectiveness of an animal therapy program to improve employment- related outcomes among VA employees. Our long-term goal is to develop a scalable and sustainable animal therapy program that the VA can use on a national level to improve workforce morale and engagement."

This will be accomplished through four Aims: Aim 1: To provide islet isolation service and training: We will continue to offer islet isolation services using rodent animal models. Depending on the needs of specific investigators, the ICBC provides training for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and research staff in pancreatic islet isolation techniques. Aim 2: To provide state of the art assays for physiological assessment of islet function: We will continue to provide consultation on experimental design and to offer a broad range of assays of pancreatic islet function, including batch incubation and perifusion, islet and cell fluorescence imaging (Cai2+), mitochondrial function assays by Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer, perifusion coupled with respirometry, and closed respirometry. We will continue to provide access and instruction for quantitative imaging of pancreatic islet mass. The ICBC provides training in perfusion techniques, in basic principles of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation and measurement of oxygen consumption by different methods, and in all aspects of islet cell physiology and biochemistry. Aim 3: To pursue procedural and equipment advances: We will support the studies of collaborators at Penn and CHOP involving human islets affected by a range of pathophysiological conditions. We will also adapt our technology and expertise to the analysis of non-islet, metabolically relevant tissues, reflecting the complex, intercommunicating, multi-organ control required to maintain normal glucose homeostasis. Technological advances will include equipment upgrades and expansion of services to include measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential and perifusion of dispersed primary islet cells in a 6 well plate format. Aim 4: To embark on a new initiative for islet cell electrophysiology: Prompted by the research needs of DRC investigators, we established collaboration with our Physiology Department, widely acknowledged for excellence in cell membrane biophysics, to provide expert consultation and experimental services in this crucial aspect of pancreatic islet cell biology and disease. In sum, the Islet Cell Biology Core is well aligned with the overall goals of the DRC, enabling investigators to perform state of the art basic and clinical research. Correlation of our phenotypic analysis performed on genetically altered or metabolically challenged mice or human source material with in vivo metabolic phenotyping and high throughput sequencing performed by other DRC cores will deepen our insights with the potential for therapeutic translation."
"9453048","ABSTRACT Seizures fail to respond to medication in 30-40% of patients with epilepsy, and epilepsy surgery is an effective alternative. We need better methods to identify epileptogenic cortex that must be removed to render patients seizure free. Chronic intracranial EEG (iEEG) telemetry recording is often required, and this poses risk, discomfort, inconvenience, and cost. The proposed project aims to develop a new method to more safely plan epilepsy surgery by reducing or eliminating the need for chronic intracranial monitoring. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a candidate biomarker of epileptogenic brain and consist of brief (25-200 msec) EEG events with a spectral content ranging between 80-600 Hz. HFO rates are elevated in the seizure onset zone (SOZ), but HFO rates may also be elevated in the epileptogenic zone (EZ) a hypothetical concept constituting the area that must be excised to attain postoperative seizure freedom. The SOZ does not always indicate the location of the EZ. The accuracy of HFO rates for determining the location of the SOZ is not established, and whether HFO rates in resected regions have different prognostic value than HFO rates outside resected regions, also requires elucidation. I hypothesize that inter-ictal HFO rates measured during acute intra- operative recording has sufficient accuracy for localizing the EZ to justify reducing or eliminating inpatient iEEG telemetry for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but not for patients with extra-temporal focal epilepsy. We will test this hypothesis in an observational clinical study of diagnostic accuracy in patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy. Aim 1 of the study will determine and compare the accuracy of HFO rates to identify the SOZ and the EZ in chronic recordings during sleep and acute recordings at the time of depth electrode implantation in patients with focal epilepsy. This will be accomplished by 1) Assessing the concordance between HFO biomarker predictions and clinical outcomes to distinguish classifiers of SOZ from EZ using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) approach, and 2) Assessing the accuracy of the rates of occurrence of the HFO biomarkers in specific neuroanatomical structures and locations. Aim 2 will determine the predictive value of resected and residual HFO biomarker rates recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG) during surgery for post-resection seizure freedom. The clinical endpoint of this aim is that the predictive value of residual HFO rates for seizure recurrence will exceed the predictive value of resected HFO rates for seizure freedom. This research study is closely integrated with my career development plan that focuses on course work in biostatistics, clinical trial design, and neuroengineering. Four mentors who are recognized leaders in clinical and translational epilepsy research, with a specific expertise in the study of HFOs, and a dedicated statistician will provide the teaching and technical expertise to assure that the study is conducted properly and that I meet the aims of my career development plan."
"9509413","Pilot & Feasibility Program (P&F): Project Summary/Abstract The Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) program has funded 121 projects (including 2016) since its inception in 1978. This program has been extremely valuable and effective by providing monies for the support of diabetes- related projects. The goal of the program is to support small research projects by new investigators (who have little or no independent research support) or established investigators who are turning to diabetes research for the first time. The vast majority of the proposals are in the former category. Three new projects are normally initiated each year. After a university-wide solicitation of proposals, four individuals (two internal and two external to the institution) review each grant. The critiques of the proposal are evaluated by the P&F Review Committee (equivalent to an NIH study section), and each proposal is assigned a priority score. The proposals and priority scores are then presented to the DRTC Executive Committee (equivalent to the NIH Council) for a funding decision. Support for a second year of research is awarded when satisfactory work is completed in year one and if support for the projects has not been obtained in the interim. The success rate of this program, measured either by the number of investigators who remain involved in diabetes research, or who convert their P&F into a nationally awarded, peer-reviewed grant, is high (33% of grants funded from 2012-2016 (5 of 15). In addition, this program funds applications from a wide variety of departments within the institution. For example, faculty members from Departments of Medicine, Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Pharmacology, Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Anesthesiology, Pediatrics, and Chemistry were funded over the past five years. The P&F program also provides visibility for the VDRTC within the Vanderbilt scientific community and thus makes the scientific community more aware of the VDRTC, its research efforts, and its core facilities. The importance and effectiveness of the VDRTC P&F program is underscored by the decision of the VUMC leadership to provide additional P&F funds ($100K/year) for this program in the next funding cycle."
"9657411","Project 2 ? Biomarkers of lung cancer risk Project Summary / Abstract The US National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated in 2011 that screening with computed tomography (CT) scans can reduce lung cancer mortality by 20%, but with important costs including a high false-detection rate of 95%. The study also indicated important differences in the benefit of screening in different participant groups as defined by their underlying risk of lung cancer, thus highlighting the urgent need to develop improved risk prediction models for identifying eligible subjects to screen. Biomarker studies of lung cancer have reported a wide range of markers that appear strongly indicative of an individual's underlying risk of developing a cancer that may be combined with information afforded by traditional questionnaire based risk factors, in particular history of tobacco exposure. We hypothesize that a comprehensive and extensively validated risk prediction model that incorporates risk-informative circulating biomarkers has the potential to substantially improve existing risk prediction models, and our pilot data on a limited set of risk biomarkers strongly supports this hypothesis. Our project will focus on systematically assessing a comprehensive panel of biomarkers of lung cancer risk that have been implicated in previous studies, and evaluate the extent to the extent to which they can improve risk prediction. This will be achieved by bringing together data from ongoing large-scale biomarker studies, and conducting a comprehensive de novo analysis of promising risk biomarkers within the Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium (LC3). We will evaluate a wide range of promising risk biomarkers implicated in lung cancer by us or other research groups, including miRNAs, metabolic, immune, and protein biomarkers, as well as epigenetic markers. The initial stage will involve assaying a panel of Promising risk biomarkers at a centralized laboratory for 850 case- control pairs from three prospective cohorts from the US, Europe and Asia, with subsequent large-scale validation of the most informative markers in another 16 prospective cohorts from the LC3 consortium, including 1,750 additional case-control pairs. The versatility of the individual LC3 cohorts will also allow us to thoroughly assess important US minorities, including African American and Hispanic subjects. All lung cancer cases that will be included were diagnosed within 5 years of blood collection. We expect that this will result in establishing a distinct panel of validated and informative risk biomarkers for use in lung cancer risk prediction models, which will be further validated in CT screening studies in collaboration with Project 3."

"9460392","The Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER) is a new shared research resource offering HCCC investigators support for high quality disease-specific outcomes research. The MER offers meticulous collection of longitudinal clinical data and biologic specimens including serum, plasma and germline DNA, all linkable to tumor samples catalogued in coordination with the Tissue Procurement Core. The HCCC strategic planning effort identified the importance of a robust infrastructure that facilitates linking molecular and clinical outcomes data. The MER is a critical component of this new infrastructure. Because the cost of such an effort is significant, the MER has focused its efforts on disease-specific groups that have the necessary clinical and research strength to utilize the resulting data. Current disease-specific groups supported by the MER include lymphoma, melanoma and sarcoma, myeloma, and cancers of the breast, pancreas, and GU. The MER is a rigorous, prospective observational database linked to a biorepository. All newly diagnosed patients with appropriate histologies as selected by the investigators are approached about informed consent. Following enrollment, MER personnel abstract clinical information including tumor stage, histology, lab and imaging data, treatment modality, treatment response, events (progression, death) and comorbidities. In general, clinical information on each subject is updated 2x/year for 3 years, then annually. Psychosocial data including quality-of-life analyses are collected longitudinally. Serum, plasma, buffy coat and peripheral blood DNA (at diagnosis and selected longitudinal time points) are collected, as is excess surgical tissue (tumor and normal) from resections and biopsies in collaboration with the Tissue Procurement Core. The clinical data are periodically validated to enable their readiness for analysis without investigators needing to return to the medical record. Over 5,000 subjects have been enrolled in the MER to date. In 2014, 35 investigators, of whom 26 were HCCC members were asking cancer questions in collaboration with HCCC members, utilized MER materials. Users came from each of the HCCC's four scientific programs. Data, biospecimens or both have been shared with 5 other NCI-designated cancer centers in the past year."

"9447554","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human gamma herpesvirus that infects approximately 95% of the population and remains latent in memory B cells as a chromatin-associated multicopy episome. EBV infection is causally associated with several pathologies including infectious mononucleosis, different types of lymphomas and gastric carcinoma. This heterogeneity in EBV-associated diseases may reflect the different gene expression programs that EBV adopts in different cell types and host-cell conditions. Epigenetic modifications and alternative viral chromatin conformations contribute to the establishment and maintenance of these alternative viral gene expression programs, which are referred to as latency types. Although we know that chromatin- organizing factors, such as CTCF, affect the epigenetic state of the EBV episome we know little about the mechanisms that govern EBV genome plasticity and function and how EBV manipulates the host epigenetic machinery to avoid complete epigenetic silencing of viral latent promoters. The long-term goal of this project is to understand how EBV hijacks host epigenetic machinery to establish a latent infection, regulating both viral and host gene expression. Post-translational modifications regulate several cellular processes including the host response against pathogens. Poly-ADP-ribosylation consists of the attachment of negatively charged polymers of ADP-ribose to acceptor proteins. The reaction is catalyzed by members of the Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family. In previous work, we demonstrated that PARP1 regulates EBV replication by interacting with the viral genome. Our preliminary work provides new genome wide and biochemical data that reveals for the first time that LMP1 activates PARP1 and that PARP1 activity prevents EZH2 from silencing the viral genome. Thus, we hypothesize that the EBV protein LMP1 affects viral gene expression by altering chromatin structure through PARP1/EZH2 interaction. Our project aims to fill the gap in our understanding of the epigenetic regulation of the EBV genome. To achieve our goal, we aim to: 1) how PARP1 activation regulates EBV latency programs; and 2) determine if EZH2 plays a role in regulating EBV latency. Completion of this project will reveal new mechanisms by which EBV can contribute to maintain and switch between different gene expression programs observed in infected cells. It will also identify new potential therapeutic targets for EBV infection and EBV-associated malignancies."
"9459849","To address a critical need for improved human tissue models to study infectious diseases, we propose to form  the MIT Center for Human Tissues and Infectious Diseases (MIT.HTMID). The MIT.HTMID Center will study  viral infections of the human brain and central nervous system by using biologically relevant two dimensional  (2D) human neural cells and three dimensional (3D) human cerebral organoids. The cells are homogeneous  preparations of human neuronal progenitors, neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia, derived  from embryonic stem (ES) cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), and will be produced in the  MIT.HTMID Human Cell and Tissue Core. Prior work has demonstrated that these cells and the organoids  formed are near-physiological in their biological functions, thereby representing an experimental system that is  superior to rodent models. MIT.HTMID Project 2 will focus on the applied use of the 2D and 3D tissue models  for the purposes of a) testing a panel of published antiviral compounds for efficacy in blocking virus infections,  and b) studying the genetics of infectious disease by performing CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockouts to identify host  dependency genes that regulate virus infections or are regulated by virus infections. Project 2 Aim 2A will test  a panel of published antiviral compounds for efficacy in blocking virus infections. The approaches will couple  the cells and organoids with infections using two types of viruses, produced in the MIT.HTMID Virology Core.  First, we will study flaviviruses, including Dengue Fever Virus, West Nile Virus, and Zika Virus. Indeed, an  important motivation for studying human brain tissue and viruses is to understand the pathogenesis of Zika  virus infections, which are causing microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome worldwide. Second, we will use  pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV) to study entry of several encephalitic viruses, including Eastern  Equine Encephalitis Virus (EEEV), Western Equine Encephalitis Virus (WEEV) and Venezuelan Equine  Encephalitis Virus (VEEV). By replacing the VSV viral envelope with that of EEEV, WEEV, or VEEV, we are  able to study virus entry of select (i.e. highly dangerous with potential application in biowarfare) agents in the  2D cells and 3D organoids. Using pseudotyped select viruses and multiple relevant cell types will allow us to  study virus tropism, pathology, and potential therapeutic targets. Project 2 Aim 2A is not a high throughput  screen; rather, the goal is to test the efficacy of a panel of published antivirals in blocking infections of the 2D  neural cells and 3D organoids. Project 2 Aim 2B.i and 2B.ii will focus on performing and validating CRISPR-  Cas9 screens that couple the neural cell types with infections by Zika virus or pseudotyped VSV. These  screens will identify host dependency factors (HDF) that are required for the viral replication cycle, and may  identify targets for therapeutic intervention. Both the antiviral testing and the genetic screening approaches will  critically evaluate the human 2D neural cells and human 3D cerebral organoids for use as a human tissue  model for infectious disease."
"9547996","ABSTRACT This application seeks to renew the D43 HIV Research Training grant entitled, ?Improving the HIV Care Cascade in Kenya through Implementation Science Training,? by building on longstanding UW collaborations with Kenyan institutions and our first 4 years of successful training. From September 2013 to the present, the program has focused on increasing capacity at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), the largest teaching and referral hospital in Kenya, and the Ministry of Health (MOH), in implementation science research targeting HIV testing, linkage to care, antiretroviral initiation and viral suppression, a continuum known as the HIV care cascade. During this period, 10 KNH Care Cascade (KNHCC) trainees have earned MPH or PhD degrees and laid a solid foundation for KNH and its partners at MOH and University of Nairobi (UON) to take a bold step towards creation of an Implementation Science and Dissemination Research Center of Excellence. This renewal application will provide critical support for the training, teaching and research activities needed to realize this vision. The program will continue to be led by Dr. Carey Farquhar, Director of the UW International AIDS Research and Training Program (IARTP) since 2003, and Dr. John Kinuthia, Head of the Department of Research and Programs at KNH. Two complementary training tracks will be offered: 1) MPH/PhD sandwich program in implementation science which will take place in Seattle, USA (year 1) and in Nairobi, Kenya (years 2-4) and 2) a 1-year certificate program which will include 1 month of mentoring and relevant coursework at the UW followed by completion of additional in-person courses and workshops at KNH and UON, UW e-learning courses, and completion of a mentored research project. Candidates for the training will have permanent positions at KNH or MOH, and may be from medicine, nursing, pharmacy or public health. We will also offer shorter in-country trainings lasting from 3 days to 1 week that reach a larger number of KNH and MOH professional staff. The short-term trainings will build broader institutional capacity, promote awareness of key research concepts and practices, and identify the best candidates for future degree and certificate training. A Steering Committee comprised of leading researchers, educators and policy makers from all 4 institutions (UW, KNH, UON, MOH) will work closely with the KNHCC Program Director and Co-director and receive regular input from an external Training Advisory Group (TAG) to ensure success of each trainee and the overall program. This success will translate into improving the HIV care cascade in Kenya and the region by producing high-quality and locally relevant research, influencing national guidelines and policies, and training the next generation of African researchers in implementation science."
"9462889","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The escalation in the linked epidemics of obesity and diabetes mellitus has led to intensive investigation into environmental and genetic factors that contribute to the spread of these diseases. In addition to sedentary lifestyle and overnutrition, several environmental factors associated with industrialization are now believed to be linked to the development of obesity and metabolic dysfunction, including an increase in night-time shiftwork, jetlag, sleep restriction, and late-night eating, all of which can be traced to the spred of electric light. More recently, the overuse of illuminated screens that emit blue light in eReaders are also believed to induce a persistent jetlag state. While epidemiologic studies have provided mounting evidence for circadian disruption as a risk factor for metabolic disease, this work is limited as it is primarily correlative and the mechanistic basis linking circadian disorder to metabolic pathophysiology are not well established. Transformative discoveries have been that the core clock transcription factors CLOCK/BMAL1 are present not only in master pacemaker neurons of the hypothalamus, but also with within peripheral metabolic tissues, and that mutation of the mammalian Clock gene leads to obesity and metabolic syndrome, characterized by alterations in feeding time and intake, sleep, and energy expenditure. Further, during our previous grant cycle, we established that CLOCK/BMAL1 dysfunction specifically in pancreas leads to hypoinsulinemic diabetes mellitus independently of effects of the mutation on early growth and development. With analysis of the interplay between the ?-cell and brain clock as the centerpiece of our grant, we have now developed inducible genetic and genomic approaches to define the molecular regulatory mechanisms through which (i) the ?-cell clock controls rhythms of endogenous glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, nutrient signaling, and triggering of vesicle release through pathways involving protein kinase C and phosphoinositide, and (ii) the brain clock coordinates feeding time with activity of hypothalamic neurons regulating energy homeostasis. Our long-term objective is to test the hypothesis that circadian disruption, and the corresponding misalignment of rhythmic genomic cycles in peripheral ?-cells and liver with those of brain, contributes to metabolic disorders by impairing glucose- responsive insulin secretion and desynchronizing hepatic gluconeogenesis with the sleep/wake-fasting/feeding cycle. An innovation of our work is the integration of studies of cellular and brain clock with genomic analyses to dissect the impact of clock time on glucose metabolism. Ultimately we are now poised to uncover new insight into how the central and peripheral clocks synchronize behavioral and transcriptional rhythms to impact physiology, findings which have broad implications for the treatment and prevention of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus."
"9650535","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Cardiovascular (CV) event prevention (e.g., myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident) remains the single most important public health problem in the United States, and cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death among VA users. Improving the provision of prevention services is a primary focus of the Secretary's New Models of Care Transformational Initiative. However, prevention has been challenging to achieve. Multifactorial behavioral interventions are effective in treating a number of chronic illnesses (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), but less is known about their ability to reduce risk among patients without a unifying chronic illness. Group visits are an efficient, effective strategy for delivering a multifactorial behavior change intervention; the VA is committed to the group visit strategy to address a wide array of primary care problems.  Groups have been shown to be an effective means of improving a number of outcomes in a number of individual diseases, but, again, their role in cardiovascular prevention among patients without a single common illness is unknown. Coaching is a type of multi-factorial behavioral intervention that involves goal-setting, and working to overcome barriers to behavior change. Coaching can be performed one-on-one, but coaching interventions have been delivered in group settings. We have shown, in a 150-subject RCT, that group coaching plus individualized telephone coaching reduces cardiovascular risk, but the population in that study was very different from typical VA users.   We propose a three-site, two-arm randomized trial measuring the effectiveness of a group prevention coaching (GPC) intervention in improving cardiovascular risk, compared to VA usual care. The study will be performed at the Durham, Buffalo, and Syracuse VAMCs. Each arm will have 200 patients; patients will be VA users without prior history of cardiovascular event, but with at least 5% risk of such an event, and with either inadequately controlled hypertension or dyslipidemia, or current smoking. The GPC intervention will focus on changing a behavior of the patient's choice that is likely to lead to improvements in cholesterol, blood pressure, or to smoking cessation. Behaviors that will be reinforced will include but not be limited to healthy eating, decreased caloric intake, increased physical activity, stress reduction, and participatory decision making with physicians. Barriers to these behaviors will be identified. The coach in both intervention arms will adopt a problem-solving approach to overcoming the above barriers and reinforcing the above behaviors; problem- solving is a well-described framework for behavior change. The GPC coach/interventionist for will be either the  facility's Health Behavior Coordinator (HBC) or a person hired for the research enterprise but trained and  credentialed identically to an HBC.   All outcomes will be obtained at baseline and 6 months after enrollment by blinded research personnel.  The primary outcome will be change in 10-year risk of fatal coronary event or non-fatal MI 6 months after enrollment, as measured by Framingham Risk Score. Key secondary outcomes will include dietary content by Food Frequency Questionnaire (26), physical activity as measured by International Physical Activity Questionnaire (27), and weight. We will also determine if group cohesion, as measured by the Group Dynamics Inventory (28), influences the effectiveness of GPC. We well also assess whether time spent in contact with a coach influences the effectiveness, by database log-in timekeeping strategies."
"9686024","Abstract: HealthRhythms, Inc. Substantial evidence supports the idea that disruptions in the regularity of behavioral routines (or ?social rhythms?) can lead to the onset of psychiatric symptoms and full blown episodes via their impact on endogenous circadian rhythms and, conversely that stable social routines protect against new mood episodes. Based on our conviction that monitoring, evaluating, and increasing the regularity of behavioral rhythms has broad applicability for improving mental health, we established HealthRhythms, Inc. (www.healthrhythms.com) with the goal of using mobile technology to add the layer of mental health care to all of healthcare. Our product model capitalizes on the ubiquity and intimacy of smartphones and their capacity to sense parameters of behavior that represent key indicators of mental health on a 24/7 basis captured in the user?s natural environment, opposed to the sporadic, in-clinic measurement that has characterized mental healthcare to date. The product we envision will ultimately have three pillars: Rhythm Sensing, Rhythm Trending, and Rhythm Stabilization. The first two of these pillars have been developed and thousands of licenses for our product have already been sold. Building on our accomplishments to date, this SBIR Phase II Direct proposal extends our work in three ways: 1) further validating our existing technology, 2) developing the next stage of our technology and 3) expanding and improving our prediction models and demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of our technology. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Enhance our Rhythm Trending capabilities through intensive examination and analysis of data from the 3,000+ patients with whom our product has already been deployed. Aim 2: Develop the envisioned Rhythm Stabilization pillar of our technology. Aim 3: Expand the nature of the data included in our prediction models and demonstrate their utility."
"9662528","Project Summary. Access to enantioenriched molecules is crucial to modern biomedical research. Many of the most important reactions in organic synthesis rely on protonation as a key mechanistic step. As such, chiral BrØnsted acid catalysis has emerged as a highly effective strategy for the production of valuable molecular building blocks in enantioenriched form. This area of catalysis has been dominated, however, by a very limited number of catalyst systems that are laborious, time-consuming, and expensive to prepare, a fact that greatly impedes new reaction discovery, development, and application. Thus, there exists a clear impetus for the invention of new enantioselective BrØnsted acid catalysts with increased potency and effectiveness that are trivial to prepare and easy to modify. In addition, there is a strong expectation that fundamentally different catalyst structures will offer orthogonal reactivity patterns and thus enable the invention of new methods. Toward this end, we have developed a fundamentally new class of highly reactive and enantioselective BrØnsted acid catalysts, based on pentacarboxycyclopentadienes (PCCPs). Notably, PCCPs are formally carbon acids with acidities that exceed many established catalytic platforms. Pentacarboxycyclopentadienes offer a number of compelling advantages including: (1) high acidity and reactivity; (2) extreme ease of preparation; (3) catalyst modularity; and (4) amenability to scale. Based on our initial investigations, we envision that PCCPs may emerge as a definitive platform for enantioselective BrØnsted acid catalysis. In each of the projects targeted herein, we aim to apply PCCP catalysis to address a prominent challenge in organic synthesis. The asymmetric transformations targeted in this grant are either currently unknown or suffer from significant limitations of substrate scope. Among the specific reactions that we aim to develop in the context of this grant are: enantioselective Mukaiyama Mannich reactions with alkyl imines; nucleophilic additions to dihydropyrrolones; enolate additions to oxocarbenium ions; Gassman-Michael reactions; benzylic alcohol substitutions; dihydrobenzofuran acetal substitutions; substitutions via oxyallyl cations; and Gassman Diels- Alder reactions. The development of these proposed transformations and the further establishment of the PCCP catalyst platform will represent significant advances for the field of organic synthesis."

"9468263","The term overlap syndrome (OS) is used to describe the association of both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obstructive sleep apnea disease (OSA) in a single Veteran. Given the high prevalence of both COPD and OSA, it is expected that a third of Veterans with OSA could be affected by OS. We demonstrated in 2 cross-sectional studies that the prevalence of OS in our Veteran population with COPD was above 44%. Importantly, Veterans with OS have a higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than either OSA or COPD-only Veterans, likely due to worse nocturnal hypoxia and subsequent inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Our preliminary data shows that serum hs-CRP levels are higher in Veterans with OS than Veterans with COPD-only. Therefore, therapy for Veterans with OS that decreases cardiovascular disease (CVD) by targeting inflammation is a high priority. Home-based exercise interventions that translate to a lifestyle with increased physical activity (PA) are an ideal strategy as 150 minutes of leisure time PA a week is associated with reduction in risk of CVD-related events and death. Further, PA decreases biomarkers of systemic inflammation (IL-6 and CRP). However, no data is available on the effect of exercise on biomarkers of systemic inflammation in Veterans with OS. It is difficult to increase the leisure time PA in adults with COPD and OSA as this population is more sedentary due to a combination of increased obesity, daytime sleepiness and dyspnea. Therefore, home-based exercise would be ideal for these Veterans. In a pilot study of 19 Veterans with COPD we demonstrated that the use of the Wii Fit program for home-based exercise was feasible and safe. The mean six-minute walk distance increased by 23 meters (p=0.01) after 12 weeks of moderate intensity exercise with the Wii Fit. Thus, adapting this exercise strategy to Veterans with OS is a novel treatment approach whose goal is durable increases in leisure time PA. Randomized controlled trials have failed to demonstrate that the current standard therapy for OSA, i.e. continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), alters inflammatory markers in OSA. The objective of this proposal is to conduct a single arm 12- week home-based exercise pilot intervention to determine the effect on biomarkers of systemic inflammation in 50 Veterans with OS on CPAP. We hypothesize that 1) Baseline PA intensity and duration will correlate inversely with the biomarkers of systemic inflammation independently of nocturnal hypoxia; and 2) Exercise training using a home-based computer exercise program will decrease biomarkers of systemic inflammation and increase exercise capacity in Veterans. To test these hypotheses, we will analyze measures of baseline PA intensity and duration (accelerometry) and biomarkers of systemic inflammation in Veterans with OS (AIM 1). Then the following parameters will be assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of home exercise training: a) biomarkers of systemic inflammation; b) PA intensity and duration; c) exercise capacity (AIM 2). Findings will support a future randomized exercise trial that will impact strategies to reduce CVD risk and in Veterans with OS through increased physical activity. The long-term clinical goal is to successfully implement a home exercise intervention in the routine medical care of the large Veteran population with sleep disordered breathing (SDB) with the ultimate goal of reducing their risk of CVD-related events and death through increased physical activity. This research area is a high priority given the high prevalence of OS and impact on Veterans' and general population morbidity, mortality and health-care associated costs."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and disability among veterans, and Department of Veterans Affairs health care users are the most severely affected.  There is ample evidence that exercise improves pain, function, and other outcomes among patients with knee OA.  However, the vast majority of individuals with knee OA are physically inactive.  There is clearly a need to develop and implement programs that efficiently and effectively foster regular physical activity and improve key patient-centered outcomes among veterans with knee OA.  The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness a novel STepped Exercise Program for Knee OsteoArthritis (STEP-KOA).  This will be a randomized controlled trial of n=345 veterans with symptomatic knee OA in two VISN 6 sites, with participants assigned to two study arms: STEP-KOA and Arthritis Education Control (AE).  STEP- KOA will begin with three months of access to a low-resource internet-based exercise training program that uses patient-specific information to determine and deliver an appropriate personalized exercise plan (Step 1).  Participants who do not meet response criteria for clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function after three months of Step 1 will additionally receive telephone calls from an  exercise counselor for three months, to facilitate adherence and address barriers to physical activity (Step 2).  Participants who still fail to meet response criteria after Step 2 will receivein-person physical therapy visits, which address specific functional impairments and further tailor exercise recommendations (Step 3).  Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months (primary outcome time point).  Veterans in the AE group will be offered participation in STEP-KOA after completing study assessments.  The primary outcome will be the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), a measure of lower extremity pain, stiffness and function.  The secondary outcomes will be objective measures of physical function.  The main study analyses will compare the STEP-KOA intervention to the AE control condition at follow-up time points.  We will also evaluate patient characteristics associated with the need for progression to each Step and will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of STEP-KOA.  This stepped exercise intervention is matched with patient needs, and it also provides the VA with a potential approach for focusing limited physical therapy resources toward patients who do not respond adequately to initial, less resource intensive and costly strategies to improve physical activity and related outcomes."
"9654509","ABSTRACT Short stature is a hallmark of several human Mendelian disorders caused by mutations in extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. These include acromelic dysplasias, a group of rare disorders featuring short stature, short digits (brachydactyly), stiff joints, and a ?pseudomuscular? build. Acromelic dysplasias are caused by dominant mutations in specific exons of fibrillin-1 (FBN1) or by recessive mutations in select ADAMTS and ADAMTSL proteins. Relevant to this proposal, the identical clinical manifestations of ADAMTSL2 and FBN1 mutations in one such disorder, geleophysic dysplasia, suggests that their gene products cooperate in a shared ECM pathway regulating postnatal limb growth. Previous work showed that ADAMTSL2 is a secreted glycoprotein that bound both fibrillin isoforms, FBN1 and FBN2, and was implicated in the regulation of TGF? signaling. FBN2 microfibrils were increased in the ECM of a mouse model for geleophysic dysplasia, suggesting a role for ADAMTSL2 in switching from prenatal FBN2 microfibrils to postnatal FBN1 microfibrils. My preliminary data show that the limb-specific deletion of ADAMTSL2 in mice impairs skeletal growth similar to human acromelic dysplasias, with exacerbated distal limb shortening and reduced Achilles tendon length. ADAMTSL2 is not expressed in growth plate chondrocytes or bone cells, but has its strongest expression in tendon. This led to the hypothesis that non-autonomous postnatal growth impairment in a mouse model for geleophysic dysplasia is caused by the disruption of fibrillin microfibril function in tendon ECM due to impairment of the ADAMTSL2-mediated fibrillin isoform switch. Despite the rarity of geleophysic dysplasia, the non- autonomous regulation of skeletal growth governed by mechanical or regulatory properties of tendon ECM would constitute a novel mechanism determining final bone length. In aim 1, I will test the hypothesis by analysing postnatal limb growth and ECM alterations in the microfibril system after Adamtsl2 deletion in tenocytes (tendon) using Scx-Cre and in an Achilles tendon transection model. In aim 2, I will investigate how ADAMTSL2 interacts with FBN1 and FBN2 and how ADAMTSL2 executes its role in the isoform switch from FBN2 to FBN1. I will analyze the genetic interaction of Adamtsl2 with Fbn1 and Fbn2 in mice and I will use protein-protein interaction studies and cell culture systems to gain mechanistic insights in the function of ADAMTSL2 in regulating the fibrillin isoform switch. The anticipated results will provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of geleophysic dysplasia and are relevant to the pathophysiology of acromelic dysplasias and other human genetic disorders involving fibrillin microfibrils (fibrillinopathies). An important and related one among these is the Marfan syndrome, which affects 1-2 in 5000 individuals and shows long bone overgrowth. These insights could be translated in novel therapeutic strategies targeting the ECM during postnatal growth. In addition, this proposal addresses fundamental questions of how tissue-specific ECM is formed and how functional properties of soft tissues determined by ECM might regulate postnatal limb growth."
"9491875","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects 15 to 24 million individuals in the US, is the nation's third leading cause of death, and exacerbations result in some 700,000 annual hospital admissions. Patients who require hospitalization suffer profound reductions in functional status and health-related quality of life that can take months to recover from. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a structured set of interventions that includes exercise training, education, behavior change and support, designed to improve the physical and psychological well-being of patients with chronic respiratory disease. Evidence demonstrating the benefits of PR for patients with stable COPD has been accruing for decades. However, in more recent years, randomized trials have shown that initiating PR during or soon after an exacerbation increases functional status, prevents rehospitalization, and improves survival. Starting PR after an exacerbation is now strongly recommended in clinical guidelines. Recognizing its many benefits, Medicare began providing insurance coverage for PR services in 2010 to patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. While the clinical impact of this landmark policy decision remains largely unknown, our preliminary data suggest that only a small fraction of potentially eligible individuals are receiving treatment. Additionally, these data suggest that rates of participation vary widely across hospitals, as do the strategies used to promote patient participation.  Our long-term goal is to improve the quality of life of patients with COPD by optimizing participation in PR. The objective of this proposal is to analyze the translation of PR into routine clinical practice among Medicare beneficiaries following hospitalization for COPD, and to identify the factors and strategies that enable some hospitals to achieve higher rates of participation than others. The proposed research will be carried out in 2 phases. The first phase (Aim 1) consists of a series of longitudinal and cross-sectional multivariable analyses using linked Medicare files. This research will close major gaps in our understanding of the uptake of PR following hospitalization, will provide novel insights about potential disparities in care, will describe and analyze sources of geographic variation, and will identify a group of hospitals with very high and very low rates of participation in PR. The second phase (Aims 2 and 3) involves the application of mixed qualitative and survey methods to refine, generate, and subsequently test hypotheses about the contextual factors and strategies that enable some hospitals to be more successful at getting patients to participate in PR than others. These activities are highly responsive to the NHLBI Strategic Plan goal to ?Advance Translational Research?, specifically, ?To facilitate innovation and accelerate research translation, knowledge dissemination, and implementation science that enhances public health.?"

Over the first 6 years of our KL2 program, we have funded 16 Scholars, nearly all of whom are pursuing careers in academics and transitioning to independence. Our KL2 Scholars are appointed for 2 years but their home departments are required to guarantee a 3rd year of 75% protected time should the Scholar not obtain his/her own K or R grant during the 2 years of KL2 funding. Because our pool of highly- qualified applicants is robust but the number of slots is limited, in 2014, we created a parallel institutionally-funded CT2 (clinical and translational research) Scholars program. KL2 and CT2 Scholars receive unlimited access to the vast array of research resources offered by the Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training (CCTST), including study design, database management, data analysis, K23 preparation support, pilot grants, research education, community-engaged research, and regulatory support. The CCTST also runs a K Club for all career development awardees and applicants, and for KL2 and other institutional K12 Scholars, a very highly regarded K Scholars peer mentoring group. The KL2 program utilizes a team mentoring approach. We have assembled a cadre of mentors who have at least $300,000 of funding, a track record of mentoring in clinical and translational research, and protected time for mentorship. We provide mentor training courses and we encourage the use of individual development plans and mentor contracts. For the renewal, we plan to train 4 KL2 Scholars at a time and to continue to appoint additional institutionally-funded CT2 Scholars. Our planned new initiatives emanate from multiple sources, including feedback from Scholars and mentors, our experience running the KL2 program, ideas generated by the former CTSA Consortium committees related to education and career development, and changes in the new CTSA funding opportunity announcement. Planned enhancements thus include training in team science; a variety of externship opportunities; mentor training for KL2 graduates; a new Career Development Council; and collaborations with other CTSA hubs in the form of joint pilot grant programs for KL2 Scholars, reciprocal reviews of Scholar applications, externships, and new courses."
"9530256","Exchange transfusion (apheresis) is a routine strategy for the management of several diseases, such as sickle cell disease, hemolytic disease of newborns, autoimmune disorders, etc. Interestingly, the body of published work on heterochronic parabiosis, the surgical joining of two animals of different ages, and more recently, our study on heterochronic blood exchange, suggest that blood apheresis can be repositioned and used as a new modality: restoring the circulatory environment of aged mammals back to a productive, young, composition, may help to rapidly and broadly enhance the maintenance and repair of multiple organs, combatting a number of degenerative diseases of brain, muscle, liver, etc. and inflammatory disorders.  In contrast to the permanent anastomosis of parabiosis, in our small animal blood exchange system animals are connected and disconnected at will, removing the influence of shared organs, adaptation to being joined, etc. Unlike parabiosis, where joint circulation is stochastically established in ~7-10 days, our procedure is less invasive and accurately controlled, the exchange volumes are easily programmed and measured; and the onset and duration of the effects can be accurately and with ease interrogated. The cells versus plasma heterochronicity can be studied and immuno-affinity modules enable removal of specific inhibitory molecules from the old circulation prior to return of such ?rejuvenated? blood into the old animal; as well as a screen for candidate systemic proteins, removal of which from young circulation inhibits tissue maintenance and repair.  We will (1) determine the onset and duration of the effects of heterochronic blood apheresis on health and maintenance of muscle, liver and brain, animal performance (strength and cognition), and systemic cytokine profile, also defining the minimal functional dose of exchanged blood that significantly influence these parameters; (2) engineer the V2 device where, in continuous apheresis between two animals of different age, circulating leukocytes are separated from plasma, studying how a cross-match of the age of cells and plasma influences tissue maintenance and repair; (3) engineer the V3 device with imunoaffinity modules allowing to screen and attenuate to young ? healthy levels candidate systemic proteins, using IL6 and TNF-a as the first candidates, that when elevated with age have negative effects on tissue health and regeneration."
"9653879","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Background/Rationale:  People with serious mental illness (SMI) die, on average, many years prematurely, with rates of premature mortality 2 to 3 times greater than the general population. Over 60% of premature deaths in this population are due to natural causes, especially poorly treated cardiovascular, respiratory, and infectious diseases. Although the VA is a centrally organized, comprehensive healthcare system, veterans with SMI still have difficulty navigating the system, and are at substantially elevated risk for premature death. Too often, they do not attend scheduled appointments or fail to engage in primary care treatment, and consequently do not get valuable preventive and primary care services.  Primary care in VA has undergone significant transformation under the Patent Aligned Care Team (PACT) model, which is based on the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) concept. PACT has the goal of improving the quality, efficiency, and patient-centeredness of primary care. But it remains unclear how PACT will impact the large populations of veterans who get the majority of their care in specialty settings, such as people with SMI. Research can inform efforts to apply the PACT model in specialty settings. For example, while people with SMI do poorly with usual primary care arrangements, there is now substantial evidence that integrated care and medical care management approaches can improve medical treatment and outcomes, and reduce treatment costs, in people with SMI. Objective:  Using available evidence, we propose to implement and evaluate a specialized PACT model that meets the needs of individuals with SMI (SMI-PACT). Methods:  This project will partner with leadership at one medical center to implement SMI-PACT, with the goal of improving healthcare and outcomes among people with SMI, while reducing unnecessary use of emergency and hospital services. Evidence-based quality improvement strategies will be used to reorganize processes of care. In a site-level controlled trial, this project will evaluate the effect, relative to usual care, of SMI-PACT implementation on (a) provision of appropriate preventive and medical treatments; (b) patient health-related quality of life and satisfaction with care; and (c) medical and mental health treatment utilization and costs. The project includes a mixed methods formative evaluation of usual care and SMI-PACT implementation to strengthen the intervention, and assess barriers and facilitators to its implementation. Mixed methods will also be used to investigate the relationships between organizational context, intervention factors, and patient and provider outcomes; and identify patient factors related to successful patient outcomes. Significance:  This project's approach to SMI-PACT is consistent with the VA PACT model, and with efforts in VA to improve care for veterans with psychiatric disorders. This will be one of the first projects to systematically implement and evaluate the PCMH and PACT concepts beyond primary care. Should SMI-PACT be demonstrated to be feasible and effective, the model could be used more broadly to improve the quality and efficiency of care for veterans with serious mental illness. Findings regarding PACT in specialty mental health may also inform efforts to improve care in other specialty healthcare settings."

"9594908","Project Summary Neutrophils are primary cells of the innate immune system that are necessary for host defense, however, persistent neutrophil inflammation contributes to tissue damage and chronic inflammation in broad diseases including cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease and cancer. It was previously thought that resolution of neutrophil inflammation occurred through neutrophil death and macrophage phagocytosis; however, we recently discovered that neutrophils also leave sites of tissue inflammation through a process referred to as neutrophil reverse migration. Here we apply microscale organotypic models to analyze onset and resolution of inflammation by 1) analyzing migration and signaling through 3D co-culture of primary neutrophils or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived neutrophils, 2) spatiotemporally separating and retrieving neutrophils during forward and reverse migration and 3) modeling neutrophil migration and reverse migration in a physiologically relevant 3D microenvironment, and. It is our goal to develop a physiologically relevant in vitro model to replicate key steps in neutrophil recruitment to and clearance from a site of inflammation. A key strength in this application is the use of organotypic microscale models that allow for the replication of the essential geometries and cellular interactions that induce and resolve neutrophil inflammation. A broad goal for the proposed research is to provide a collaborative, multi-disciplinary (engineering, biologists, clinicians) approach to a fundamental problem relevant to human health ? namely, inflammation and its resolution at sites of tissue injury. We strive to develop practical tools and methods that will transform our ability to identify signaling pathways that modify neutrophil forward and reverse migration and have therapeutic potential. A particular focus is the paracrine signals generated by macrophages, endothelial cells, and neutrophils in co- and tri-culture and the characterization of induced pluripotent stem cell derived neutrophils as a model for primary human neutrophils (Aim 1). Furthermore, the use of layered open microfluidics technology will allow us to separate neutrophils at different stages in bidirectional migration to identify spatiotemporal regulation of neutrophil behavior (Aim 2). Finally, we will investigate the trafficking of human neutrophils and their interactions with macrophages and endothelial cells in response to different inflammatory stimuli in a physiologically relevant organotypic in vitro model to examine neutrophil reverse migration and how it is altered in disease (Aim 3). We expect our findings to address a gap in understanding how cells communicate during the onset and resolution of inflammation, and the further development of iPS derived neutrophils that may provide novel avenues for therapeutic interventions for human disease."

"9497753","The purpose of this TMRC program is to establish a Center of Excellence focused on understanding all aspects of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) due to Leishmania donovani in the current phase of the VL elimination initiative in India, that aims to reduce incidence of clinical disease to a very low level. Many unknowns persist with regard to the feasibility of totally interrupting L. donovani transmission, especially as only 1 out of 10 infections leads to clinical disease. The intent of the scientific group planning this application is to generate a body of knowledge and an investigative team that is ready for any resurgence of the disease, possibly in new endemic areas of the country. We propose three research projects focused on the parameters of transmission and persistence of L.donovani in India. Project 1 will use methods established in prior funding periods for surveillance and monitoring of VL, and use global metabolomics profiling to identify biomarkers of asymptomatic infection, and put this in the context of the gut microbiome and co-infection with other NTDs as risks for progression to VL. Project 2 will monitor the emergence of insecticide resistant populations of Phlebotomus argentipes, the sand fly vector for VL, and examine factors underlying vector competence and the transmissibility of L. donovani from human or animal reservoirs. Project 3 will examine immune factors underlying and contrasting symptomatic VL versus asymptomatic L. donovani infection, both systemically and localized in the skin. The Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) that was initiated in the current funding period will monitor the demographics and health status of selected populations in Bihar State. Thus, the program will comprehensively examine the extrinsic and intrinsic host factors that underlie the maintenance and continued transmission of VL in Bihar State, India. Aims of the TMRC program are: (1) To maintain and further develop the TMRC as a VL Center of Excellence that addresses knowledge gaps as India progresses toward the goal of disease elimination; (2) To discover environmental and entomological factors that promote disease persistence in the population; (3) To discover human immune factors that determine whether an infected person will develop an asymptomatic or symptomatic outcome; (4) To transform the HDSS into a forward-looking program that is ready for future studies of disease outbreaks, treatment, or immunoprophylaxis of endemic infectious diseases. The research team includes a multi-disciplinary group of investigators sharing the ambition to train the next generation of Indian VL experts. Together the group constitutes a strong team able to move us toward understanding the changing dynamics of transmission of this vector borne disease."
"9452961","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease represents a major cause of reduced lifespans in people with schizophrenia, which has been estimated at 15 - 25 years shorter than the general population. Obesity and associated metabolic problems, such as hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, are important contributors to cardiovascular disease, represent known side effects of antipsychotic medications, and are highly prevalent in schizophrenia. However, pharmacological treatment options for this patient group are limited given that many FDA-approved weight loss drugs are sympathomimetic, which can raise the risk of psychotic exacerbation. Metformin, an antihyperglycemic that acts in part via glucagon-like peptide-1 to reduce appetite and slow gastric emptying, has been found to safely reduce weight in non-diabetic overweight people with schizophrenia. Our group recently found that 16 weeks of adjunctive metformin led to 2 kg differential weight loss compared to placebo in 146 overweight people with schizophrenia. Because weight loss with metformin is modest, the identification of other safe, non-sympathomimetic options for this population is critical. Lorcaserin is a 5-HT2C agonist recently approved for weight loss. Lorcaserin is associated with ~5.5 kg weight loss compared to baseline and ~3 kg weight loss compared to placebo over 52 weeks in overweight, otherwise healthy adults. The appetite-reducing effect of lorcaserin is mediated in part through melanocortin receptor 4. Given significant weight loss from each of these two drugs with distinct mechanisms of action, this study will build on our preliminary data with metformin to test a strategy of metformin/lorcaserin combination treatment versus lorcaserin monotherapy versus placebo in overweight people with schizophrenia. In non-psychiatric populations, combination treatment has been used successfully for weight loss (i.e., phentermine/topiramate combination treatment) and for other chronic disorders such as hypertension, epilepsy, and diabetes when monotherapy was inadequate. 90 overweight people with schizophrenia (BMI>27) will participate in a 52-week double-blind, randomized study to assess the efficacy and safety of lorcaserin/metformin combination treatment, lorcaserin monotherapy and placebo on weight, body composition, and measures of glucose and lipid metabolism. Behavioral assessments of appetite and plasma levels of key appetite-regulating hormones including leptin, ghrelin and GLP-1 will be measured to examine mechanisms of action of lorcaserin and metformin for weight loss in this population. 24- hour food-recall assessments and accelerometer-based physical activity assessments will help determine the potentially confounding effects of energy intake and expenditure. All subjects will receive a behavioral intervention promoting a healthy diet and increased physical activity. The current proposal will help define new and safe long-term options for treating obesity in people with schizophrenia, critical for this vulnerable population with high rates of obesity and associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."

"9603804","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Irritability emerges during infancy and is a substrate of many common forms of developmental psychopathology. However, reliable identification of irritable infants at high risk for clinical progression is challenging due to high levels of normatve variation combined with substantial individual differences in adaptive or maladaptive outcomes for irritable infants over time. Building on our prior work at preschool age, the proposed study utilizes a neurodevelopmental framework to generate empirically derived, parameters for differentiation of irritability patterns that mark risk for clinical progression. Key innovations ae: (1) novel approach to specification of developmentally atypical patterns of irritability beginning n infancy; (2) joint developmental consideration of irritability, executive function, and prefrontal cortical regions; and (3) transactional focus examining the clinical import of early irritability wthin the context of parent-infant mutual (dys)regulation. To derive population-based parameters, we first conduct a cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of 12-36 mos. olds (N=2,000). We then ascertain an independent community cohort (N=350 infants oversampled for irritability), with intensive longitudinal follow-up from 12-36 months. Focal irritability assessments are: (a) bimonthly parent reports and real-time monitoring of irritable vocalizations via the Language Environment Analysis (LENA) Pro device; and (b) annual direct observations of irritable temperament and behavior (12, 24 & 36 mos.). Performance-based assessments of executive function occur annually. Transactional processes are assessed via parental contingent responses to infant irritable vocalizations on the LENA Pro (bimonthly) and event-coded parent-infant mutual regulation processes (annually). Clinical progression is captured via latent dimensional clinical risk over time. SPECIFIC AIMS: IA. Differentiate developmentally atypical irritability patterns from infancy-early preschool age via population-based parameters cross-sectionally (IAi) and quantitative longitudinal parameters (IAii). IB. Specify longitudinal parameters of irritability to optimize prediction of clinical progression. IIA-B. Map developmentally atypical irritability patterns to disruptions in the maturation of executive functin and prefrontal cortical (PFC) regions and test the hypothesis that their joint consideration will enhance predictive clinical utility. Prefrontal cortical maturation will be assessed from infant natural sleep-MRI derived estimates of anatomical properties at 12 & 36 months in an extreme group sub-sample (n=100). We test the hypothesis that atypical irritability patterns will predict slowed executive function development and abnormal PFC anatomy. IIIA-B. Elucidate how transactional processes shape clinical prediction, testing the hypothesis that parent-infant mutual regulation processes modulate clinical progression. Specification of neurodevelopmental irritability phenotypes within transactional context provides a critical empirical base for targete prevention of mental disorder in its earliest prodromal phases."
"9461621","SUMMARY: PROJECT 3 Common psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ), in which symptoms manifest in late adolescence or early adulthood, are increasingly considered neurodevelopmental disorders. There is substantial evidence, for example, that maternal viral disease with resulting immune activation (maternal immune activation, or MIA) significantly increases the risk of having a child who is ultimately diagnosed with SZ. Yet, very little is known about the consequences of MIA on the developmental trajectory of the brain. This knowledge might offer enhanced opportunities for prevention or early treatment. Over the last 8 years, the Center team has developed a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of MIA: a modified form of a viral mimic adapted for use in primates (poly IC/LC) is recognized as foreign by the primate immune system and induces a transient innate inflammatory response. Offspring from this NHP MIA model display abnormal behaviors from early postnatal development that increase in severity up to adulthood. This is the first use of poly IC/LC-induced MIA in the rhesus monkey, which directly parallels the much larger literature on the rodent poly IC model. In addition to behavioral disturbances, members of this Center recently discovered several other phenotypes that are expected in a model for SZ. At 3-4 years of age, offspring exhibit enhanced striatal dopamine uptake, a hallmark of psychosis, as well as neural inflammation. The working hypothesis is that there will be MIA-induced prodromal modifications of the trajectory of brain development that presage the emergence of behavioral abnormalities. Project 3 will carry out longitudinal structural and resting state functional MRI studies of a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys, half of which will be exposed to MIA; the entire cohort will be behaviorally tested by the NHP Core. The objectives are to establish MIA-induced abnormal brain organization signature in the NHP and compare it to that of MIA-exposed mice and human patients undergoing their first episode of SZ. To test this working hypothesis, the project will pursue the following aims: 1) determine normal and abnormal trajectories of structural brain development for NHP controls and individuals exposed to MIA during gestation; 2) Identify atypical functional connectivity in NHP controls and individuals exposed to MIA during gestation; 3) Compare the MIA-induced abnormal brain organization signature established in NHP to brain abnormalities observed in MIA-exposed mice and human patients undergoing their first episode of SZ. These studies will reveal hitherto unknown information on the alterations in brain development caused by MIA that may precede psychosis. Moreover, establishing a common developmental neuropathology across mice, monkeys and humans will lead to clinically useful biomarkers for detecting individuals at high risk for SZ and will promote earlier prevention and more effective treatment."
"9509408","Cell Imaging Shared Resource (CISR): Project Summary/Abstract The Vanderbilt Diabetes Research and Training Center (VDRTC) will continue to support the VDRTC Cell Imaging Core, operated by the Cell Imaging Shared Resource (CISR), and ensure that VDRTC-affiliated investigators will have full access to state-of-the-art imaging equipment and expert technical support to conduct sophisticated microscopy and analysis of tissue and cellular anatomy and physiology. By utilizing a large, well- established facility, the VDRTC Cell Imaging Core provides high levels of quality control, a dedicated, expert staff and a significant economy of scale for services that would be difficult (if not impossible) for individual investigators to establish and support. This organizational structure fits well with the centralized approach to prevent needless duplication of scientific resources within federally funded research centers, enabling focused development of technology that serves all Vanderbilt research, including VDRTC investigators. The overall goal of the VDRTC Cell Imaging Core is to provide the full range of modern microscopy and digital imaging capabilities and techniques to enable and accelerate diabetes research at Vanderbilt through three objectives: 1) acquire and maintain state-of-the art optical and EM imaging technology; 2) train, assist, and encourage VDRTC-affiliated investigators to incorporate optical, EM, and in vivo imaging technologies into their research; and 3) develop new imaging technologies that will be useful for diabetes research. Without VDRTC support, the breadth and quality of advanced microscopy service would be severely limited. The VDRTC support grant also reduces the net cost of imaging service to VDRTC investigators and has helped provide financial stability essential to sustain historically high levels of service to VDRTC researchers. This stability has been vital to the successful acquisition of new instruments and services that support VDRTC researchers. During the past 5 years, investigators representing 84 separate VDRTC-affiliated laboratories (a 31% increase from the prior cycle) have used all aspects of the CISR. Over the same period, CISR initiatives taken to obtain equipment grants, combined with institutional contributions, have provided $4,766,063 in new capital equipment, managed by the CISR, for the benefit of VDRTC investigators.

"9458258","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MYC transcription factors are frequently dysregulated in cancer. Chromatin-associated protein complexes link MYC to increased histone lysine acetylation in the epigenome. Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, which bind to these acetylated histone lysines and recruit MYC protein, have therefore emerged as compelling targets in cancer, with inhibitors entering clinical trials. Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood, with high-risk disease frequently showing Amplification of MYCN. We performed an unbiased screen of diverse cancer cell lines for sensitivity to BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETi). We validated the activity of both BRD4-directed shRNA and BETi against MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells, extending these studies in vivo both to patient derived xenografts (PDX) and to genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma. Importantly, while BETi showed remarkable efficacy in vivo, they were not curative, suggesting the need for combination therapies. We hypothesize tat BETi block interactions of MYCN with the epigenetic machinery, and that combination therapies incorporating BETi represent a robust, translatable approach to enhance efficacy, and block emergent resistance in MYCN-driven NB. Our proposal identifies A) Mechanisms through which blockade of MYCN interferes with transformation, B) Mechanisms by which tumors develop resistance to BETi, and C) Translatable combination therapies to block emergent resistance. Successful completion guides effective clinical translation of BETi as pathway-specific inhibitors of MYCN. Aim 1: To clarify a role for EZH2 as a mediator of response to BETi, in MYCN-driven neuroblastoma. Aim 2: To test BETi with EZH2i, and with other translatable combination therapies in preclinical trials in neuroblastoma. Aim 3: To guide development of additional effective combination therapies, by identifying emergent mechanisms for resistance."
"9648687","The purpose of this core is to support the proposed projects by generating and maintaining animal models  for in vivo studies investigating how anti-influenza antibodies regulate host immunity during virus infection.  The first aim of the animal core will be to maintain transgenic lines of mice for use by each project. Our  recent studies have demonstrated that interactions between the Fc constant region of broadly neutralizing  antibodies (bNAbs) and Fc receptors (FcRs) are required for optimal neutralization of influenza viruses in  vivo. However, the human (hu) FcR system differs from that of mice in expression patterns, the affinities of  each human IgG Fc subclass for each huFcR, and which huFcRs and effector cells dominate in vivo.  Therefore, in order to address the functional contributions of huFcRs during in vivo viral neutralization with  human bNAbs, we have recently generated FcR-humanized mice, which express the full array of huFcRs on  a background lacking all mouse FcRs and with the capacity to elicit human IgG mediated Fc responses.  FcyR-humanized mice recapitulate the unique expression profile of huFcyRs and function to mediate the  inflammatory, immunomodulatory and cytotoxic activities of hulgG antibodies in vivo. These animals will be  vital for investigating in vivo neutralization by human bNAbs, understanding the mechanism of neutralization  in vivo, and investigating methods to enhance neutralization in vivo by manipulating Fc-FcR interactions.  This core will also support the maintenance of mouse lines lacking specific FcIRs and lines in which specific  FcR are conditionally deleted in specific cell subsets. These mouse strains will be crucial to support studies  investigating the mechanisms by which bNAbs neutralize virus in vivo, and this animal core will support the  maintenance of these mouse lines for use by all investigators in this project.  Passive administration of hulgG bNAbs to mice results in an anti-huIgG response which clears the human  bNAb. This clearance of passively-transferred human bNAb precludes long-term in vivo studies with human  bNAbs in mice. Therefore, the second aim of the animal core will be to generate a knock-in mouse line in  which the hulgGI constant region replaces the mouse lgG2a constant region. Thus, this mouse will express  hulgGI as a self-protein and be tolerized to passive human bNAb administration. This line will be crossed to  the FcR-humanized mouse line, thereby generating a superior in vivo model in which long-term studies of  human IgG bNAbs can be performed in the context of human FcR effector function."
"9492641","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Endovascular intervention is the predominant mode of for treating intracranial aneurysms (IAs). As a minimally invasive alternative to open-skull surgery, it obliterates an aneurysm by either filling it with platinum coils to decrease inflow and induce aneurysmal thrombosis, or diverting blood flow away using stent-like flow diverters (FDs) to induce gradual aneurysmal occlusion and parent vessel reconstruction. Despite its immense success, 30% of coiled IAs experience recanalization (recurrence), while 10% of FD-treated IAs fail to occlude. Patients experiencing such negative outcomes are subjected to increased risks for IA rupture and complications from treatment. This grant aims at developing a method to predict treatment outcome a priori. Our central hypothesis is that, with other factors, postprocedural hemodynamics predicts endovascular treatment outcome. This proposal aims to both develop clinically-practical computational tools to simulate endovascular treatment strategies and test the above hypothesis by creating predictive models that utilize hemodynamics from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations on cases treated in silico. In Aim 1, we will develop and test rapid simulation tools for coil and FD implantation. Our methods are based on novel ball-winding (coil deployment) and ball-sweeping (FD deployment) algorithms. These methods improve upon existing ones by mimicking clinical deployment strategies with superior computational efficiency. To test if our modeling techniques recapitulate the effects of actual device deployment, we will compare CFD results from treated IAs in silico against hemodynamics experimentally measured by particle image velocimetry in treated patient- specific IA phantoms. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that postprocedural hemodynamics, with other clinical factors, predicts patient angiographic outcome. To this end we will apply virtual intervention retrospectively to 700 treated IA cases at our institute, model post-treatment hemodynamics using CFD, and develop multivariate statistical models for treatment outcome based on patient data. We will use an innovative two-tiered statistical approach to extract models for treatment outcome prediction: discriminant function analysis to pre-screen a large number of candidate variables, followed by multivariate logistic regression for creation of parsimonious predictive models. In Aim 3, we will independently test the models prospectively on a new cohort of 300 treated IAs to determine if the models can correctly predict treatment outcome at 12 months. Successful completion of this project will establish-for the first time-a computational tool to predict IA treatment outcome a priori, thereby enabling neurosurgeons to assess different treatment strategies prior to device deployment. When implemented in the procedure room, this new ability will allow for optimization of treatment for individual patients and development of new strategies for those cases with higher failure rates. This project brings together experienced investigators from multiple disciplines and provides an unprecedented opportunity to translate engineering and computational advancements into clinical usage."
"9462047","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Physical activity imposes changes in load to skeletal muscle, which adapts through acute changes in biochemical signaling pathways and longer-term alterations in protein expression. One important mechanical sensor is the sarcoglycan (SG) complex, which is lost from the muscle membrane (sarcolemma) in both Duchenne and Limb Girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD). Absence of ?-SG loss induces severe muscle degeneration and signaling defects in response to mechanical load without causing susceptibility to contractile damage, suggesting that LGMD pathology arises in part through disruption of normal mechanotransduction signaling through the SG complex. In a recent advance, the applicants have discovered that archvillin, a muscle-specific isoform of supervillin, is a ?-SG- and dystrophin-interacting protein and that archvillin association with phosphorylated ERK1/2 (P-ERK) increases dramatically, if and only if ?-SG is present, following eccentric contraction of muscle. Aim 1 is to determine the molecular bases for the associations of archvillin with ?-SG and P-ERK at rest and following stretch. Aim 2 is to determine the consequences of archvillin loss upon mechanical signal transduction in normal and dystrophic muscles. Aim 3 is to use drugs in clinical trials for other diseases to determine how up- or down-regulation of the molecular pathways identified in preliminary studies and in Aim 1 affects the progression of muscle pathology in gsg-/- mice, a model for human LGMD2C. Completion of these aims will elucidate the role of archvillin in mechanochemical signal transduction in muscle, identify new proteins in SG-mediated signaling, and determine whether modulation of the identified pathways has therapeutic potential."
"9657414","The overarching goal of the Biostatistics and Informatics Core is to provide statistical, informatic and computational support for the Program Project to conduct advanced and large-scale statistical analyses to identify and characterize the accuracy of risk factors in predicting and screening lung cancer. The Core faculty and other researchers engage in mission-related research motivated by questions and methodological challenges that arise from these projects. The members of this Core have extensive expertise and interests that unite their activities among Projects. By forming a Biostatistics and Informatics Core that functions across projects, we anticipate a more robust and profound level of support for Program research than could be achieved if biostatisticians were nested within each project. The Core allows us to pool resources (e.g. expertise in statistical genetics, statistical and machine learning) across projects and also draw on the broader resources available in multiple participating institutes, such as the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and the Department of Biomedical Data Science at Dartmouth University. The members of the Core have extensive experience in the development and application of new statistical and machine learning methods for the study of genetic susceptibility to cancer risk prediction, and risk assessment. They have worked together over years on studies relating to lung cancer development. The Core provides an environment for coordinating and planning of research across the program projects and to develop and apply state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning methods that meet the needs of this Program Project. To support the Program projects, we propose the following aims: (1) To ensure that all Projects are grounded in sound biostatistical and informatic principles and use state-of-the-art methods for design and analysis; (2) To provide expert advice related to design and analysis in statistical genetics, bioinformatics, and machine learning and statistical learning for all Projects; (3) To conduct mission-related statistical methods research by developing novel statistical methods to address the quantitative needs of the Program Project; (4) To disseminate the proposed statistical methodological developments via expository articles, case studies, and web-shared software; (5) To provide education and training for researchers and students by working with the Steering Committee and the Program investigators.

"9615597","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In 2016, US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that there is insufficient evidence (grade ?I?) to support universal screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in primary care. They end their report with multiple suggestions for future research, including: 1) studies that assess the impact of false positive screening on families, and 2) studies that explore characteristics of children, families, and systems that are more and less effectively engaged in the screening, diagnosis, and treatment process. To move the Task Force from an ?I? recommendation, studies are needed that respond to the USPSTF suggestions for future research. Our current R01, which is already prospectively collecting data on a large sample of children who screen positives for ASD in primary care for 12-months, creates an opportunity ? with only a small amount of additional data collection ? to address many of the Task Force?s suggestions for future work. First, we will use these data to identify children with a false-positive ASD screen (estimate n=130) and measure benefits (e.g. frequency of alternate diagnoses, access to services) and harms (e.g. parental distress) in these families by: 1) Performing a structured chart review to identify/confirm false-positive screens; 2) Using regression and proportional hazards modeling to compare parent-reported measures (e.g., stress, social support), and systems measures (time to diagnosis) between families with false-positive and true-positive ASD screen; and 3) conducting semi-structured interviews with a subset of false-positive families to further explore experiences. Then, using Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional hazards modeling, and multivariable logistic regression analyses, we will assess the impact of parent concern (reported at the time of an ASD screen) on how families progress through each stage of the diagnosis and treatment framework as proposed by the USPSFT, as well as impact on parent-reported outcomes. The goal of these investigations is to provide data needed to move the Task Force from an ?I? to a formal recommendation."

"9462035","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human vaccines have most often been generated by trial and error with little understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in the protective immunity that they provide. This system of vaccine development has been remarkably effective against pathogens that exhibit little variability over time; however, it has become evident that a much more sophisticated approach is required to develop broadly protective vaccines against pathogens that undergo continuous structural change, such as influenza viruses. Current influenza virus vaccines confer protection by eliciting antibodies that block viral entry by bindin regions of the virus that are highly mutable. In order for antibody-based therapies and vaccines to be effective against a breadth of structurally diverse influenza viruses, protection will clearl have to be gained through alternate routes of blocking viral replication. The identification of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the  conserved stalk domain of the viral hemagglutinin (HA), by members of our group and by others, was a  groundbreaking advance, as many of these antibodies are able to block fusion of viral and endosomal membranes, yet bind epitopes that are relatively resistant to structural change. A second critical finding by members of our group was that protection mediated by anti-stalk antibodies at low concentrations is dependent on Fc-Fc Receptor (FcR) interactions; therefore, antibody isotype determines protective activity of anti-stalk antibodies at lower concentrations. The current proposal is for a multi-center investigation into molecular mechanisms that can be harnessed to provide broad-based protection against influenza viruses.  Our projects include: 1) Precise mapping of epitopes on the viral HA and neuraminidase glycoproteins that mediate virus neutralization, and dissection of mechanisms by which they achieve neutralization. 2)  Immunization studies using chimeric influenza virus proteins designed to identify structural elements able to mediate broad-spectrum humoral immunity. 3) Delineation of the roles of Fc-FcR interactions in viral neutralization. 4) Investigation in human subjects into how to elicit antibodies with favorable Fc domains during vaccination. 5) Studies on the natural evolution of human B cell specificities against influenza antigens. 6) Identification of specific sequences of influenza antigen exposures that elicit broad-spectrum, anti-influenza humoral immunity. Overall, our intention is to better understand the mechanisms of broadly protective humoral immune responses against the influenza virus surface proteins and thereby create a blueprint for advancing a new generation of broadly protective influenza virus vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics."
"9541137","Project Summary: Immune therapies have significantly improved outcomes for cancer patients with poor prognosis in recent years, in many cases providing complete remissions with no trace of residual disease. However, these therapies are currently restricted to specific cancer types, and do not reach the majority of cancer patients. The two most successful forms consist of either using blocking antibodies specific for inhibitory ligands commonly expressed on T lymphocytes, allowing enhanced functionality of T cells, known as inhibitory checkpoint blockade (ICB), or the engineering of autologous T cells to target tumors through chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Unfortunately, CAR T cell therapy has shown limited efficacy in solid tumors, and ICB is most effective in tumors with pre-existing immune infiltrate and heavy mutational loads. Thus, significant innovation is needed to extend the benefits of immune therapies to the majority of cancer patients. Our lab has recently identified the structured RNA 7SL1 (RN7SL1) as capable of stimulating immune response genes in tumor cells following secretion of the RNA by stromal cells. Although the 7SL1 RNA is not well studied in an immune context, structured RNA is a well-known immunostimulatory motif. Thus, I hypothesize that unshielded 7SL1 in the tumor microenvironment stimulates immune activation and contributes to ICB responsiveness. Given that CAR T cell therapy has not been effective in solid tumors, engaging an endogenous immune response similar to that seen following administration of ICB, which has shown efficacy in solid tumors, is an attractive prospect. To that end I have designed a T cell-based system for delivering structured RNA directly to the tumor microenvironment. I hypothesize that combining the production of stimulatory RNA with CAR T cell functionality in the tumor microenvironment will stimulate endogenous immune responses and improve the anti-tumor efficacy of CAR T cells in solid tumors. In order to test these hypotheses, I will use fibroblast cell lines designed to secrete high or low levels of unshielded 7SL1 in the tumor microenvironment in combination with current ICB regimens to determine the contribution of this stimulatory element to antitumor immunity. Additionally, I will assay the efficacy of this newly developed T cell system using syngeneic tumor models expressing a model antigen. These approaches will be complimented by genetic knock-out mouse models to determine the importance of specific immune cell types in carrying out these anti-tumor responses. In total, these experiments will serve to determine the importance of a novel immunostimulatory RNA to anti-tumor immunity and test the functionality of a novel CAR T cell-based approach to anti-tumor immune activation."
"9634472","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite significant national progress in reducing central line-associated blood stream infection (CLABSI) rates, CLABSI remains a leading cause of preventable healthcare-associated harm in American neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Most CLABSIs occur after central line insertion during the maintenance phase when central lines are frequently accessed by nurses for intravenous medication administration (IVMA). CLABSIs are mostly preventable when nurses reliably adhere to standardized care processes such as central line maintenance guidelines, yet NICUs report difficulty sustaining guideline adherence. Current approaches to increasing adherence focus on improving individual clinician performance, although such approaches are not effective for sustaining guideline adherence over time. An alternative approach is necessary to sustain CLABSI reductions made through quality improvement efforts. We propose to rigorously identify hazards and assess risks associated with NICU nurses' adherence to CLABSI and IVMA guidelines. We will take a human factors engineering approach and use the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model of work system and patient safety to conduct a prospective risk assessment of guideline adherence. The specific aims of the study are to 1) Identify hazards in the NICU work system that threaten nurses' adherence to CLABSI and IVMA guidelines and 2) Assess risk of potential failure modes associated with guideline adherence. We will employ both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods to achieve the aims including direct observations, interviews, Healthcare Failures Modes and Effects Analysis, and focus groups conducted with nurses who provide direct patient care in the NICU. This study is relevant to the public's health because it will increase our understanding of how factors in the NICU work system (technologies, tasks, the environment) influence nurses' adherence (and non-adherence) to guidelines intended to prevent hospital-acquired infections and IVMA-related errors. The results of this project will directly inform interventions to improve guideline adherence in the NICU and enhance neonatal patient safety."
"9474600","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for the Data Coordinating Center for the Soft Bifocal Contact Lens Myopia Control Study, a mulfl-center, randomized clinical trial designed to answer 3 important issues related to slowing eye growth in myopic children. We will determine whether soft bifocal contact lenses slow myopia progression in children. The soft bifocal contact lenses will create a wide distribution of peripheral defocus in myopic subjects, which will allow us to determine whether the amount of peripheral myopic defocus is related to slower myopia progression. Measuring the peripheral refractive error without contact lenses will allow us to monitor changes in eye shape to determine whether peripheral defocus primarily changes local eye growth or affects the growth of the entire eye.  In this trial, 294 children aged 7 to 11 years with myopia will be randomly assigned to wear soft bifocal (either Biofinity Multifocal with +2.50 D add or with +1.50 add; Cooper Vision, Fairfield, NY) or single vision (Biofinity; Cooper Vision, Fairfield, NY) contact lenses. A comparison of the myopia progression experienced by the treatment groups will determine if the soft bifocal lenses slow myopia, while peripheral findings will provide additional information about the regulation of peripheral eye growth.  As the Data Coordinating Center for the Soft Bifocal Contact Lens Myopia Control Study, we will complete the following Specific Aims: 1.) implement the protocol as designed by the Soft Bifocal Contact Lens Myopia Control Study Executive Committee; 2) implement data collection procedures via electronic data capture systems that ensure high-quality data in a secured fashion; and 3) analyze the data using appropriate statistical methodology and ensure that the results are accurately reported."
"9686251","Summary: Microvascular rarefaction with reduced coronary flow reserve (CFR) has been shown to contribute to diastolic dysfunction. Although a significant coronary microvascular rarefaction occurs in type II diabetes/obesity, surprisingly, little is known about capillary rarefaction in diastolic dysfunction. In the last grant cycle, we have showed that obesity/diabetes disrupts angiopoietins/Tie-2 system in favor Ang-2, thus leading to microvascular phenotypic alterations and capillary rarefaction with a reduction of CFR. The microvascular phenotypic alterations/rarefaction and reduced CFR may render cardiomyocyte vulnerable to hypoxia, thus leading to a diastolic dysfunction in diabetes/obesity. However, the molecular mechanisms that lead to coronary microvascular phenotypic changes and capillary rarefaction in diabetes/obesity is not clearly defined. This renewal proposal will specific investigate Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3), a metabolic sensor, on EC glycolytic metabolism and capillary rarefaction. Aim 1: To define the mechanism(s) by which ablation of endothelial Sirt3 leads to coronary microvascular dysfunction with a focus on impairment of endothelial glycolytic metabolism. First, we will determine whether improvement of glycolysis increases angiogenesis and mitochondrial function, and reduces ROS formation by overexpression of HIF-2? in Sirt3 deficient EC in vitro. Further, we will determine whether endothelial specific overexpression of HIF-2? upregulates PFKFB3 expression, increases capillary density, restores CFR, and improves diastolic function in Sirt3ECKO mice and Sirt3ECKO- DIO mice. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that disruption of endothelial Sirt3-PFKFB3 signaling pathway promotes microvascular rarefaction in diabetes. In vitro, we will determine whether overexpression of PFKFB3 rescues impaired glycolysis, thus leading to increase in the expression of angiogenic growth factors, reducing ROS formation and inflammation in Sirt3KO-EC. We also determine whether specific overexpression of PFKFB3 in EC reduces ROS formation, attenuates EC inflammation and prevents capillary rarefaction, and restores CFR and diastolic function in Sirt3ECKO-DIO mice and diabetic db/db mice. Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that ablation of endothelial Sirt3 promotes capillary rarefaction by a mechanism involving upregulation of Ang-2 and loss of pericytes in diabetes. We will determine whether blockade of Ang-2 rescues impaired EC/pericyte coverage and attenuates coronary microvascular rarefaction in Sirt3ECKO and Sirt3ECKO-DIO mice. Using Notch3KO/db/db mouse as a model of loss of pericytes, we will further determine whether inhibition of Ang-2 attenuates loss of cardiac pericytes and coronary microvascular rarefaction, improves CFR and diastolic function in diabetes."
"9490324","The Radioimmunoassay and Biomarkers Core proposes to continue offering an increasing number of high quality immunoassay services to our evolving group of Diabetes Research Center (DRC) basic, translational, and clinical scientists. Services over the last cycle have included radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and multiplex ELISA on the Luminex platform for an expanding variety of diabetes and metabolism related hormones and cytokines derived from blood, urine, and tissue samples. These assay services have proven essential for current research in the DRC and Penn's Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism (IDOM) and will remain an integral part of the future operation and development of the Center and Institute. In the next cycle the RIA/Biomarkers Core will expand its existing services to include the development of assays on a more sensitive multiplex platform based on digital ELISA (Simoa). Simoa technology will be used to develop a novel glucagon ELISA necessary for low sample volume islet studies in rodents and in perifusion experiments, and to implement accurate multiplexing of cytokines at 1000-fold increased sensitivity required for understanding the intersection of inflammation and metabolism in rodent and human studies, and so enhance the value of assay services for DRC investigators. In addition, the Core will proactively engage in outreach to the local research community of diabetes, obesity and metabolism investigators, while enhancing the QA/QC/QM of the assay services provided. In addition, the RIA/Biomarkers Core will integrate delivery of new and existing assay services to an expanding base of investigators in a new state of the art-laboratory housed within IDOM. The new laboratory location will place the Core on the same floor and in near proximity to the Islet Cell Biology, Functional Genomics, and Mouse Phenotyping, Physiology & Metabolism Cores that will enhance the already close interactions among these DRC Cores. The integrated delivery of assay services provided by the Core will be enhanced by further development of informatics infrastructure for ordering, tracking, billing and delivery of service. The performance of a large number of RIAs and ELISAs in a central core facility rather than in scattered locations throughout the University provides a significant overall savings in equipment, personnel effort, and supplies for our investigators, while importantly allowing for the generation of results with better quality due to our enhanced quality control/quality assurance/quality management (QA/QC/QM) processes. We will continue collaborations with other NIH- sponsored core resources and the School of Medicine at Penn in order to enhance and expand the number of services available to our investigators, increase efficiency and technical expertise in the provision of assay services, and continue to improve our throughput and data quality."

"9500447","ABSTRACT: In the United States gross mortality from invasive fungal disease is approximately 50%. People with AIDS, chemotherapy patients, and transplant recipients are at highest risk of acquiring life-threatening infections, but many fungi also cause disease in apparently healthy individuals. The environmental yeast Cryptococcus epitomizes this trend. Like many fungi, infection with Cryptococcus occurs when it is inhaled into the lung from which it can disseminate to the central nervous system (CNS) and cause disease. Once in the CNS Cryptococcus causes fungal meningoencephalitis that is fatal ~25% of the time, even with state-of-the-art treatment. This high incidence of mortality is consistent with other invasive fungal diseases and indicative of the dire need for improved therapeutics. To develop new strategies for combating invasive fungal pathogens, it is imperative that we gain a better understanding of the fundamental biology of fungal pathogens. Our long- term research goal is to understand the properties of fungal infectious particles and how they cause disease. In Cryptococcus, both yeast and spores are likely infectious particles of humans, but studies of the pathogenic potential of spores were historically hampered by technical limitations. Recently, however, we purified spores to homogeneity in numbers sufficient for comprehensive biochemical, molecular, and virulence studies. Using this novel reagent, we discovered that spores can cause disease in a mouse model, providing the first evidence that spores can act as infectious particles in mammalian cryptococcosis. The objective of this proposed project is to investigate for the first time the key processes by which fungal spores transition from quiescent cells into vegetatively growing yeast (germinate) and infect the mammalian lung. Our central hypothesis is that by determining the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing spore germination and lung invasion, we will identify key events in spore-mediated infections that can be targeted for inhibition. To test this hypothesis, we will carry out two Specific Aims: 1) identify the cellular and molecular events that occur during germination of spores and 2) determine the mechanism(s) by which spores cross the epithelium to colonize the lung. We will combine molecular and classical genetics, gene expression data, protein composition data, and quantitative high-resolution germination assays to parse the germination process into discrete events. At the same time we will use in vitro tissue culture models, a new organotypic microlung model, and a mouse intranasal model of infection to determine how spores colonize the lung. These innovative experiments will result in an in-depth map of germination pathways and insights into how spores invade the host. Understanding pathways and processes associated with the two pivotal events that occur during spore- mediated disease (germination and infection) makes significant contributions to the long-term objective of this work to identify new and diverse molecular, cellular, and systemic targets that can be exploited for novel antifungal therapeutic strategies to prevent and/or treat cryptococcosis and other fatal human fungal diseases."
"9461082","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, long-time collaborators Dill, Fennell and Vlachy propose experiments and theory to improve computational models of solvation in complex protein solutions. Explicit- and implicit-solvent models have grown increasingly powerful, but are not able to handle important challenges in modeling proteins in concentrated environments, or in high-salt environments, or in the complex formulations of biological drugs (monoclonal antibodies). Researchers cannot yet reliably compute protein aggregation, solubilities, solution viscosities, the formation of amyloid oligomers or fibrils, or Hofmeister effects, nor can they yet rationally design solution formulations that prevent the precipitation of biologicals, or design optimal conditions for protein crystallization. The specific aims here are: (1) Statistical mechanics solution theory and systematic experiments on protein type, concentration and salt-series. To apply a new statistical mechanical approach (Wertheim theory for strongly-associating media applied to the KVD model of protein solutions) to treat complex multicomponent mixtures of proteins, with salts and excipients over a range of concentrations, and as a function of temperature. This is a bottom-up first-principles approach (based on a Hamiltonian of all the intermolecular interactions), not based on averaged-solvent such as implicit-solvent or DLVO approaches. There is a huge need for systematic studies of protein association, pairwise and multimeric, vs. salts and conditions. This will be done by Vlachy's group, which has long-standing expertise, and in conjunction with collaborators at Amgen. Extensive preliminary theory and experiment results are in hand. (2) SEA Water and i-PMF. Fast physical simplified models of solvation at the atomistic scale for solvation free energies and PMFs are in development. Recent proofs show SEA Water is as accurate as explicit-solvent and as fast as implicit-solvent. (3) Making our methods available.

Additional solubility prediction tools will be offered on a website."
"9479631","Abstract Despite dramatic changes in family behavior in the U.S. over the last 150 years, local level marriage and divorce data over time are not available in analysis-friendly formats nor via Decennial Censuses. Therefore, spatial and temporal variation in how these marriage and divorce patterns operate are unknown. The objective of this proposal is to archive, document, harmonize, and disseminate nearly 150 years (1867-2010) of existing county and state-level administrative data on marriage and divorce. Administrative data are the only source of historical counts of marriage and divorce at the local level. These data exist in disparate formats including official reports, pamphlets, books, and websites. The rationale underling this project is that these resources are not available on a wide scale in useable formats (i.e. in conjunction with other county and state-level variables or in a GIS or statistical package format) and the effort for any one researcher to compile these data is too onerous, OR it is taken for granted that these variables are already available. Our approach will make these marriage and divorce data available in an existing database of other county and state-level data in analysis- friendly formats in conjunction with tools and resources for county and state-level analyses. Data sharing will be expanded by also disseminating data via interactive maps and infographics?further broadening the potential audience and impact of these important data. The expected outcome is innovative research that enables researchers to better understand and explain changes in family structure over a broad sweep of time and across the entire U.S. allowing them to address novel research questions about context. Research centers with specialized knowledge and established track records for reaching national audiences are ideally suited to conduct these activities, which places the National Center for Family & Marriage Research and Minnesota Population Center in a unique position to archive and disseminate this valuable set of historical administrative data not available anywhere else. These data and tools will fuel researchers to develop innovative ways of combining and using administrative and survey data. Importantly, this effort will serve multidisciplinary researchers including demographers, economists, geographers, historians, and public policy scholars who use geographic data as well as large household surveys. This project fits squarely with the PDB mission to enhance knowledge and data availability on families and households. The application is consistent with the purpose of the R03 mechanism and the program announcement to archive and document existing data to enable secondary analysis by a broad set of researchers."
"9686257","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid advances in human genetics have prompted concerns about the public's readiness to process and utilize the knowledge gained to make informed decisions about their health. To facilitate genetic literacy, several government agencies including the Office of the Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have advocated for the increased use of family health history assessment. The family health history, currently underutilized in primary care, offers an ideal proxy to assess genomic risk and is the simplest applied genomic tool available. Web-based family history tools are now publicly available to facilitate its collection, including My Family Health Portrait (MFHP) from the Office of the Surgeon General. Although family history tools like MFHP are developed for general public use, there is evidence to suggest that they may not be accessible to a large portion of the general population with limited health literacy, due to high reading grade demands and navigational challenges. An innovative approach previously demonstrated to overcome challenges with inadequate health literacy and computer literacy in health care settings is the use of Relational Agents (RAs), computer-animated characters that simulate conversations with patients. We have developed a prototype virtual counselor (VICKY: Virtual Counselor for Knowing Your Family History) to collect family health history information for common health conditions including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, hypertension and various cancers. In the proposed study, we plan to refine the virtual counselor and conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the efficacy of using VICKY to the existing MFHP tool for collecting family health history information among an underserved primary care patient population. The primary aims of the study are to 1) evaluate the efficacy of VICKY versus MFHP for collecting accurate family health histories and 2) determine whether accuracy varies as a function of health literacy. Secondary aims of the study will explore factors associated with the effective use of computerized family history tools and examine the impact of the tools on family and provider communication behaviors (e.g., sharing of family history information). This project will be the first to systematically obtain validation data on the efficacy of both VICKY and MFHP for collecting accurate family history data among an underserved patient population, in two languages (English and Spanish). We will determine whether a virtual counselor can overcome many of the existing barriers to using traditional web-based family history tools. This study is uniquely situated to provide insight on the most effective approaches to gathering electronic family history data from underserved populations such that they may be later integrated with electronic health record systems and broadly disseminated. Study findings will inform subsequent implementation efforts of these tools to maximize reach and effectiveness, with the goal of improving the systematic documentation and use of family history in primary care to identify those at greatest risk for chronic diseases who would benefit from preventive intervention efforts."
"9408656","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nonhuman primates (NHP) offer the most appropriate experimental model for many areas of human biomedical research, particularly in reproductive medicine, immunology and transplantation, and neurological disease. Furthermore, monkey induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are envisioned as a valuable renewable resource of cells for preclinical testing of personalized regenerative medicine approaches. Based on initial advances in common marmoset assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) developed at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (WNPRC), the production of transgenic common marmosets expressing green fluorescent protein, including the demonstration of germline transmission, has been reported. Marmoset monkeys present several advantages for transgenic approaches, including the ability to routinely carry multiple offspring (rapidly increasing cohort size), facile reproductive management, and a shorter lifespan, which facilitates the study of age-related diseases such as diabetes, arthritis and Parkinson's disease (PD). In regards to PD, identification of specific alleles of the leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) in familial and sporadic cases of PD supports the development of a NHP model expressing these variants, as proof-of-principle for the contribution of human alleles to disease pathophysiology. We propose to advance the development of animal disease models for stem cell-based therapeutic applications with two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To optimize reprogramming of iPSCs from common marmoset fibroblasts, to use transgene expression and genomic editing to define the effect of alleles associated with PD on in vitro neural differentiation in isogenic iPSC lines, and to use genomic editing tools to define the feasibility, efficiency and accuracy of genomic editing in IVF-derived common marmoset embryos. Specific Aim 2. To produce transgenic marmoset monkeys carrying wild-type and PD-associated human LRRK2 alleles and evaluate a proof-of-principle cohort for PD pathophysiology. The long-term goal of this work is to provide investigators with marmoset iPSC lines, and genetically modified common marmosets as platforms for translational research, particularly in the treatment of diseases for which primate species are the most suitable models. Animal experiments will be performed at WNPRC, which is one of the few facilities in North America housing an experimental common marmoset colony, and the only Center where marmosets, primate embryology, and cutting edge neurological translational models are actively being used to test therapies for human disease. The proposed generation and analysis of transgenic monkeys and associated modified iPSCs will provide a platform to create disease specific models and cells, and develop tests of therapeutic approaches, including personalized medicine using engraftment of iPSCs."
"9509411","Islet Procurement and Analysis Core (IPA): Project Summary/Abstract The Islet Procurement and Analysis (IPA) Core was established in 2007 as a result of growing demand for murine islets from multiple members within the Vanderbilt DRTC. Over the last funding cycle, the IPA Core provided services to 56 different investigators (49 Vanderbilt and 7 External Non-Profit) by assisting with 2981 procedures. Islet biology, development, and function in normal homeostasis and disease including a broad spectrum of islet-related processes raging from intracellular signaling, physiological response and adaptation, the immunology of type 1 diabetes, the function of islet-enriched transcription factors in development and maintenance of normal hormone-secreting status and cell fate, all the way to islet transplantation, are major research areas of the Vanderbilt DRTC. An essential component supporting the experimental pipeline of the majority of studies falling under this paradigm is our ability to isolate high quality, well-characterized rodent pancreatic islets, and then to perform complex assays of islet function. In addition, the core provides VDRTC investigators with high-resolution imaging solutions that allow bulk-tissue-imaging and fine-detail quantitative assessment of pancreatic islet morphology. Utilizing whole-slide imaging technology, the IPA Core recently developed and published standards for automated measurement of beta cell mass, and this technique is now broadly used by VDRTC members. In this cycle of competitive renewal, the throughput of procedures and number of services under the IPA Core are expected to more than double as part of the newly established Quality Control Core Facility (QCCF) for the NIDDK-supported Integrated Islet Distribution Program (IIDP), which distributes human islets nationwide and internationally from six US-based islet isolation centers. This novel and essential QCCF program centered within the IPA Core will utilize the robust infrastructure, services, and expertise of the IPA Core and directly benefit eleven VDRTC members who already use human islets from IIDP in their research. Through its standardized assessment of human islet function, cell composition, and islet health, the QCCF and IPA Core will build, together with the IIDP, a database of well-characterized human islet preparations from normal pancreas donors that will be an exceptionally valuable resource for the field. By having a centralized facility, the IPA Core provides VDRTC investigators with high-quality data of standardized islet assessment by procedures using established SOPs, optimized over the last decade for reproducibility and time effectiveness, balanced against maximal data output and at a lower price than would otherwise be possible."
"9460512","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to establish a series of nonhuman primate models for the investigation of human visual system disorders. Currently, the mouse is the predominant model system used in this field, largely due to our ability to generate genetically engineered animals for the study of specific diseases. However, despite their similarities with humans, mice and other rodents do not have a cone-rich macula, the region most critical for human vision. Therefore, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model system that more closely matches human will offer important new insights into disease processes and provide much improved opportunities for development and testing of novel treatments or preventions for specific eye diseases. Our initial sequencing results from ~200 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) indicate that the genetic diversity among macaques is much greater than among people. Among the macaques, we found many individuals carrying pathogenic mutations in known human retinal disease genes. Therefore, the macaque model represents a golden but currently untapped opportunity for innovative research. It is feasible to leverage existing infrastructure to generate a wide range of novel primate models (breeding lines with informative mutations) that will be invaluable for research concerning pathogenesis and the development of treatments. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and begin exploiting its potential, we propose to: Aim 1. Perform targeted sequencing of retinal disease genes in 1,600 individual rhesus macaques. Aim 2. Establish a mutational database for macaque eye genes. Aim 3. Generate multiple macaque models of human eye diseases. Aim 4. Characterize the phenotypes produced and begin testing of treatments of macaque models"
"9465502","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) causes 2,200 deaths in Americans every day with one death every 39 seconds. There is evidence that these deaths can be prevented with better risk factor management, however, many risk factors remain uncontrolled. The Patient-Centered Medical Home (Medical Home) which includes self-management, personalized health records and team-based care, has been proposed as a strategy to reduce these gaps in care delivery. Several Cochrane reviews and meta-analyses have found evidence that adding pharmacists to the primary care team improves risk factor control and physician adherence to guidelines. Managed care organizations have found that a centralized cardiovascular risk service (CVRS) managed by pharmacists can reduce mortality. It is not known if a comprehensive CVRS model would be implemented in typical office practices and this lack of evidence is a major gap in the literature.  The objective of this application is t conduct a multi-center, cluster-randomized study utilizing a centralized CVRS in medical offices with large geographic, racial and ethnic diversity to determine the extent to which the CVRS model will be implemented. We will randomize 16 primary care offices to the CVRS or usual care and enroll 400 subjects of which 220 subjects will be from racial minorities. We will also select 25 patients per office (n=400, total n=800) into a passive observation group which will allow us to determine the extent to which the intervention diffuses more broadly for unexposed patients. Our central hypothesis is that a centralized CVRS managed by clinical pharmacists will be implemented and significantly improve CVD guideline adherence using the Guideline Advantage metrics. The rationale for this proposed study is that implementation of a novel strategy to improve secondary prevention of CVD will lead to innovative strategies for broader adoption by health systems throughout the US. We will accomplish our objectives and test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims:  Our primary Aim is: To determine if a web-based CVRS managed by clinical pharmacists will be implemented within diverse primary care offices. We postulate that adherence to guidelines for secondary prevention of CVD will be significantly greater in patients from clinics randomized to the centralized CVRS group compared to the control group.  This study is expected to produce the following outcomes: guideline adherence will be 40% at baseline and increase to at least 60% in the intervention group at 12 months. We expect guideline adherence will deteriorate after the intervention is discontinued but will remain significantly higher than the control group."

"9658153","PROGRAM SUMMARY Crohn's disease (CD) is a debilitating condition with no known cure. The precise cause(s) of CD remain undefined. Increasing evidence suggests that CD may be initiated by a dysregulated innate immune response against unknown antigens in a genetically-susceptible host. The major strengths of this competitive renewal are the unique mouse models of CD-like ileitis, which have been extensively investigated by our group, and the highly synergistic nature of the program. During the last funding period, this Program Project Grant (PPG) has made important discoveries and provided evidence of a key role for innate immunity and NOD2 signaling in the pathogenesis of CD-like experimental ileitis. The objective of this competitive renewal application is to continue our efforts to define the role of innate immunity in CD by using a multidisciplinary approach that takes advantage of the complementary and synergistic expertise of the three PIs and their collaborators, as well as the scientific cores that provide unique services that are otherwise unavailable to PPG investigators. The Program Project will continue to be directed by Dr. Fabio Cominelli and will consist of three projects and three cores. Project 1, headed by Dr. Fabio Cominelli, will extend his focus on NOD1 and RIP2 signaling, and investigate the hypothesis that the interaction(s) between NOD receptors, intestinal dysbiosis and IL-1 play a key role in the pathogenesis of CD-like ileitis. Project 2, headed by Dr. Derek Abbott, will test the hypothesis that aberrant ubiquitination patterns influence the pathogenesis of IBD using CRISPR technologies, retroviral reconstitution experiments, and cutting edge mass spectrometry methodologies. Project 3, headed by Dr. Theresa Pizarro, will study the role of IL-33 and ILCs, and their interactions with the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of CD-like ileitis. These projects are supported by an Administrative Core, which provides administrative support, monitors scientific progress, and coordinates the enrichment program. The Mouse Congenics Core will centralize production and breeding of mice with experimental CD and the development of congenic substrains for the individual projects. The Germ- free and Gut Microbiome Core will provide germ-free mice, as well as sequencing- and culture-based analysis of the gut microbiota to the individual projects. The long-term goal of this Program Project is to understand key pathogenic mechanisms of innate immunity in experimental CD, which can be immediately translated to the human condition, to aid development of a cure for at least a subgroup of patients with this devastating disease."
"9443637","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A variety of cellular processes are commonly subverted to encourage the proliferation of cancer cells, one of which is the unfolded protein response (UPR) that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In normal cells, improperly folded or glycosylated proteins will occasionally accumulate in the ER due to a variety of causes that are common in the tumor milieu (examples include altered glucose levels, redox state, calcium levels, and chemical stressors). The cell activates the UPR to prevent accumulation of unfolded proteins, which eventually leads to proteotoxicity and cell death. Importantly, heightened expression of BiP, an essential chaperone protein in the Endoplasmic Reticulum, is a critical factor for this survival mechanism in a variety of cancers. We have recently discovered a new form of BiP regulation, AMPylation by the protein FicD. We observe that FicD adds an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) molecule to a threonine near the ATP binding site of BiP during normal growth conditions. This modification rapidly disappears under multiple ER stress-inducing conditions. We hypothesize that this reversible modification inhibits the chaperone activity of a portion of cellular BiP, and this inhibition is relieved to increase the amount of acive chaperone during ER stress and promote cell survival. Our plan is to characterize the effect of FicD-mediated AMPylation on BiP and determine if the deAMPylating enzyme is a viable inhibition target. We want to understand the basic machinery and mechanisms involved in this signaling system. These studies will have great impact on the understanding of how this system is corrupted in  cells  with  disrupted  protein  homeostasis  (proteostasis),  such  as  cancer,  diabetes,  prtein  processing disorders and aging."
"9546011","Abstract Maternal aging has dramatic effects on the oocyte quality and competence, and it is well known that mitochondrial function plays important roles in oocyte health. Post-transcriptional gene regulation within the oocyte is also essential for its normal development and function. In somatic cells, mitochondria are key effectors of post-transcriptional gene regulation, where RNA sensors located on the mitochondria react in response to double stranded RNA (dsRNA) to invoke the mitochondrial RNA defense pathway. The role of the mitochondrial defense pathway, which includes RNA-editing and RNA sensing is unknown in the oocyte, even though the oocyte has an abundance of dsRNA within it. Here we provide preliminary data demonstrating an abundance of RNA edits in mouse and human oocytes, the expression of `adenosine deaminase acting on RNA' (ADAR), as well as downstream components of the RNA sensing pathway in mouse and human oocytes. Most importantly, we show that inhibition of ADAR RNA editing in oocytes results in increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus implicating RNA editing as a regulator of mitochondrial function and possibly oocyte quality. Lastly, data from reproductively old mice indicate that the genes involved in RNA editing (ADAR1) and RNA sensing (p32) are decreased in oocytes, thus potentially leading to aberrant activation of mitochondrial RNA-dependent defense pathway. We propose that oocyte mitochondria are key effectors of the RNA editing and RNA sensing mechanisms within oocytes, under conditions such as aging, hyper-activity of mitochondrial RNA defense may increase ROS accumulation and ultimately impact oocyte quality. The central hypothesis we intend to test in this proposal is that the mitochondrial RNA defense pathway is a critical regulator of oocyte competence/quality. To test the central hypothesis, Specific Aim 1 will identify the specific oocyte RNA edits occurring in three species of mammalian oocytes. Specific Aim 2 will determine the role of ADAR1 and RIG-I/MAVS in the regulation of mitochondrial function in oocytes using state-of-the-art mitochondrial functional assays and assess the impact on oocyte quality/developmental potential. Specific Aim 3 will examine how advanced reproductive age impacts mitochondrial RNA sensing pathways in both mouse and human oocytes. Ultimately, this work may provide a mechanistic link (dsRNA defense pathway) that can explain the known mitochondrial dysfunction associated with oocytes from reproductively old mice and older IVF patients."
"9540572","Project Summary  Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric cancer of the developing peripheral sympathetic nervous system and accounts for 15% of all childhood cancer deaths. A large majority of high-risk NB patients initially respond to chemotherapy but 60% will face therapy-resistant relapses. Current therapies for these patients are highly toxic and lack efficacy, indicating an urgent unmet need for new treatment options. Recently, whole genome sequencing analysis of paired primary and relapse tumors revealed that 78% of relapsed tumors had mutations activating the RAS-MAPK pathway (N=23). Aberrant signaling in relapsed tumors was shown to stem from acquired mutations and copy number variations in MAPK-related genes, including RAS, ALK, NF1, and PTPN11. Subsequent in vitro studies showed that 11/18 neuroblastoma cell lines had RAS-MAPK-activating mutations and were sensitive to inhibition of the downstream enzymes MEK1 and MEK2. Although MEK1/2 inhibitors (MEKi) appear efficacious in preclinical testing, targeting this critical pathway is notoriously difficult because resistance is common. I hypothesize that targeting MEK1/2 in combination with proteins conferring resistance to MEK-inhibition will provide therapeutic benefit in preclinical models of neuroblastoma. Current literature has implicated the Yap-Hippo pathway in RAS-MAPK resistance to MEKi therapies in melanoma and NSCLC. In Aim 1A, I will utilize lentiviral CRISPR-CAS9 genome editing to knock down YAP protein expression to observe effects on proliferation, survival, and cellular signaling with and without MEK inhibition. In Aim 1B, I will perform lentiviral-mediated overexpression of an unphosphorylated form of the YAP protein to investigate enhanced resistance to MEK inhibition using cell-based assays. To identify alternative resistance to MEKi therapy, I will study kinase drug targets obtained from a screen assessing cell viability in the presence of a MEK inhibitor and a protein kinase siRNA library in four RAS-MAPK-mutated cell lines. The screen two hits (KSR and MAP3K3) were common among three and 12 hits were common among two cell lines. In Aim 2A, I will utilize CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown studies of candidate kinase genes to functionally characterize synthetic lethality and resistance mechanisms in RAS-MAPK-mutated cell lines. In Aim 2B, I will prioritize validated kinase targets based on available pharmacological inhibitors and characterize in vitro and in vivo drug efficacy in combination with a MEK inhibitor. These studies will yield new insights into the cellular processes conferring resistance to RAS-MAPK-inhibition in neuroblastoma. This understanding will address a clinical need for novel combination therapies for relapsed patients with aberrant RAS-MAPK signaling and contribute to a deeper understanding of cancer signaling responses to MEK inhibition. ! !"
"9658089","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this three-year postdoctoral training program is to empower the applicant with the necessary skills and network to establish an independent laboratory in the United States studying regeneration in newts (salamanders). Newts are critical components of the regenerative research landscape due to their ability to replace complex body parts after loss. Limb regeneration is an important model in this regard. Central to newt limb regeneration is the formation of a blastema; a heterogeneous mass of cells that develop into the new limb. Despite its centrality, we have a minimal understanding of the blastema and lack any specific expression markers. The applicant will identify the genes and cis-regulatory elements that regulate blastema formation in the Iberian newt and develop fluorescent expression markers to identify blastema cell types in vivo. This will be accomplished through the following research plan. First, functionally relevant genomic regions will be sequenced and assembled by a combination of whole genome sequencing and selectively sequencing open chromatin (Aim 1). Second, using single-cell transcriptomics, the cell types contributing to the blastema at will be classified and marker genes identified. Additionally, by integrating this single-cell transcriptomic information with obtained genomic sequences, cis-regulatory elements that are over- or under- represented in blastema markers genes will be identified (Aim 2). Third, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, transgenic newts expressing fluorescent blastema markers will be developed (Aim 3). The identified genes, cis-regulatory elements and transgenic newts will offer unprecedented knowledge and tools to further understand the regulation of regeneration, thereby enabling the applicant to begin a promising independent career in regeneration research."
"9458260","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  High-grade gliomas are the leading cause of brain tumor-related death in both children and adults. We have recently shown that cortical neuronal activity promotes the growth of high-grade glioma in vitro and in vivo. A major mechanism mediating the growth-promoting effect of neuronal activity on high grade glioma is activity-regulated secretion of the synaptic protein neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) ectodomain, which we have shown to be both sufficient and necessary in situ and in vitro. Soluble neuroligin-3 stimulates the PI3K-mTOR pathway in glioma cells and also induces feed-forward expression of glioma NLGN3, but the upstream signaling events are not yet elucidated. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we now seek to confirm the necessity of NLGN3 for in vivo glioma growth and to determine the cellular origin(s) of secreted NLGN3 using constitutive and inducible NLGN3 genetic deletion strategies together with in vivo optogenetic techniques and patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models. In Aim 2 we will identify the activity-regulated enzyme responsible for NLGN3 secretion using pharmacological and genetic strategies. In Aim 3 we will identify the NLGN3 binding partner in glioma cells using the range of adult and pediatric patient-derived high grade glioma models we have developed, co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis. The proposed experiments will deepen our understanding of the mechanisms by which neurons promote cancer growth in the glioma microenvironment and will identify potential targets of therapy for these deadly cancers."

"9468444","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a fatal, progressive adult-onset disease characterized by autonomic and motor dysfunction with widespread CNS demyelination. We have previously shown that ADLD is caused by duplications of the lamin b1 gene and that increased expression of lamin B1 underlies the disease process. In eukaryotic cells, lamin B1 is a major constituent of the nuclear lamina, a fibrous meshwork adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane. The nuclear lamina maintains the structural integrity of the nucleus and has roles in essential cellular processes including transcription, DNA replication, DNA repair, and epigenetic regulation. We have recently demonstrated that transgenic (TG) mice with oligodendrocyte specific over-expression of lamin B1 exhibit severe vacuolar demyelination of the spinal cord that result in age dependent degenerative phenotypes reminiscent of ADLD. TG spinal cords showed dramatic reductions in the expression of multiple genes responsible for lipid synthesis, including the critical lipogenic transcription factors, SREBP1 and 2. This was accompanied by global increases in the repressive histone marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in spinal cord oligodendrocytes. As myelin is made up of ~70% lipids, defects of lipid synthesis can result in severe demyelination. Consistent with our gene expression data, we observed a significant reduction of myelin enriched lipids that were specific to the spinal cord white matter. Our results identify lipid synthesis defects as a major component of the demyelination caused by lamin B1 over-expression and suggests a novel link between lamin B1 and lipid metabolism. While lipid dysregulation provides a cogent framework for explaining the demyelination observed in the transgenic mice, the mechanisms linking lamin B1 over-expression and lipid synthesis in oligodendrocytes are unknown and this proposal aims at identifying these pathways. We will test the hypothesis that lamin B1 modulates repressive histone marks to down regulate expression of specific target genes and examine whether lamin B1 over expression in oligodendrocytes results in the dysregulation of specific pathways that may impact oligodendrocyte function. We will also determine how modulating lamin B1 levels impacts the disease phenotype. The experiments that we have proposed will elucidate mechanisms linking lamin B1 over-expression, lipid dysregulation and the demyelination phenotype, results that will be critical in the identification of therapeutic pathways for ADLD. In addition, they will also provide insights into the basic biology of oligodendrocyte function that may help in understanding other common demyelinating diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis."
"9463460","CEET Informatics Core (CIC) Abstract The CIC provides the structure and service to integrate large-scale data sets that may be generated in CEET centric cores such as the Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core and the Translational Biomarker Core or from Penn service cores that generate genomics data. Quantitative disciplines such as toxicology and environmental health sciences depend heavily on informatics to integrate data sets from disparate sources so that systems biology approaches can be used to determine exposure endpoints. Demands arise at multiple points during the experimental pipeline, placing researchers at risk of bottlenecks unless informatics services are both adequately provisioned and tightly integrated with their needs. The CIC therefore provides an essential service that must grow and adapt to the changing requirements of its users. The CIC has identified the following core service goals: (i) to provide a consultancy that enables CEET researchers to design and analyze omics scale experiments; (ii) to implement a data analysis pipeline for next-generation sequencing studies, starting with the most common use cases and regularly updating as needs and methodologies evolve; (iii) to foster a systems approach to toxicology by integration of high-dimensional biological datasets; (iv) to promote transparent and efficient work practices by effectively communicating both the informatics methods that are available and the scientific results that they produce; (v) to establish robust collaborations between CEET researchers and domain experts in informatics that progress all of the above goals; and (vi) to identify and help meet informatics training needs for CEET researchers. In addition, it is vital that the CIC continues to evaluate ongoing needs and to build capacity in the ever-changing informatics landscape, while building on the achievements of the existing core. The personnel of the core have demonstrated strength in all of these key areas. The Director, Dr. Thomas Price, has more than a decade of postdoctoral experience in bioinformatics as both a methodological researcher and a core service provider. Professor John Hogenesch will act as a consultant to Core activities and has more than 20 years of experience in bioinformatics with training in toxicology."
"9526655","Abstract:  Craniofacial malformations, including cleft palate and craniofacial skeletal defects, are among the most common structural birth defects in humans. Using a phenotype-driven genetic screen to identify new genes that play important roles in craniofacial development, we isolated an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutation that causes cleft palate and skeletal dysplasia in mice. The specific mutant phenotypes resemble that previously described in Fgf18-/- mutant mice, including cleft palate and shorter limbs with angulated radius and bowed tibia. However, targeted sequencing of the Fgf18 gene did not find any mutation. Using whole exome sequencing followed by allele-specific genotyping, the cleft palate and skeletal defects in this mutant mouse line have been found to completely co-segregate with homozygosity of a nonsense mutation in the Adamts6 gene, Adamts6Q999*. Remarkably, mice homozygous for an independent ENU-induced missense mutation, Adamts6S149R, exhibit similar cleft palate and limb defects. Whereas little is currently known about the cellular and molecular functions of ADAMTS6, the primary sequence of the ADAMTS6 protein identifies it as a member of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin-like and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) family of secreted, extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated metalloproteinases. Structurally, ADAMTS6 is most closely related to ADAMTS10, which has been shown to bind to fibrillin-1 (FBN1), a major component of the ECM fibrils. FBN1 has been implicated in regulating TGF? signaling by sequestering the TGF? ligands in latent complexes in the ECM. Since TGF? signaling plays crucial roles in craniofacial and skeletal development and since FGF signaling is also modulated by interactions between the FGF ligands and ECM components, we hypothesize that ADAMTS6 regulates craniofacial and skeletal development through regulation of TGF? and/or FGF18 signaling. We propose two specific aims for this Exploratory/Developmental Grant application: (1) to test the hypothesis that ADAMTS6 regulates FGF18 and/or TGF? signaling during craniofacial and skeletal development, and (2) to generate Adamts6 conditional mice using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing and to elucidate cell type-specific ADAMTS6 functions in craniofacial and skeletal development. These studies explore novel aspects of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of craniofacial development and will significantly advance the understanding of ADAMTS function in development and diseases."
"9472879","Project 5: PICALM, Oligomeric Abeta and Inflammation in Neurovascular Pathogenesis in AD  In this renewal the emphasis will still be on how Abeta and inflammation affect cerebrovascular function, but will  also take advantage of recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that have identified new AD risk  genes that have been broadly linked to inflammation/endosomal processing. Because the blood brain barrier  (BBB) is critically important for efficient transport of solutes in and out of the central nervous system (CNS),  and phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) one of the genes identified with  increased risk for AD is involved with initiating endocytosis/transcytosis of APP, ApoE and Abeta by endothelial  cells, we have chosen to focus on how the PICALM risk variant affects endothelial function in the presence  oligomeric Ap, angiotensin II, and inflammation (IL-1beta). Finally, because meta-analysis of AD risk loci has  revealed interactions between PICALM and APOE genotypes, where PICALM conferred risk predominantiy  in APOE e4-positive subjects, we propose to include APOE genotypes in our research strategy. Since  PICALM knockout mice show deficits in erythroid maturation and transferrin internalization, we hypothesize  that the PICALM risk variant represents either a deficit in endocytosis or an altered trafficking  function where vesicle cargo is misrouted. We propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To investigate  the contribution of the PICALM AD risk variant on the level of parenchymal amyloid load, type-1 and type-2  cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Ap40 & 42 levels, tau, and inflammation in the UCI ADRC autopsy cases. Aim  2: We will investigate how human iPSCs-derived ECs homozygous PICALM risk or non-risk alleles affect  endocytic function and vesicular trafficking in endothelial cells (APOE genotypes 3/3, versus ?3/?4). Aim 3:  We will test endocytosis and transcytosis of transferrin, LRP1, ApoE and TrkB receptors, as well as APP and  Ap using an in vitro transwell model of the BBB. We will use iPSCs-derived ECs homozygous for PICALM  risk or non-risk coding variants and astrocytes from Down syndrome (DS) and non-DS that express APOE  ?3/?3 or ApoE ?3/?4. Aim 4: To test the role of PICALM in EC BBB function on Ap vascular pathology in vivo.  We propose to develop a transgenic mouse model with reduced expression of PICALM in endothelial cells  using the Cre-LoxP System. The conditional EC PICALM knock-out mice will be crossed with APP Tg mice  that develop Type 2 CAA or Type 1 CAA and the effect of PICALM knockdown on CAA, as well as  parenchymal Abeta will be assessed."
"9457329","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The field of stem cell biology is advancing at an incredible speed, with new techniques emerging on a regular basis allowing for deeper investigations into the mechanisms underlying adult stem cell biology and tissue regeneration. Wnt signaling and Notch signaling have been identified as two key pathways that regulate adult stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Past research has focused on the role of Wnt signaling during bone regeneration, in particular on its role as a stem cell activator and pro-osteogenic growth factor. The Notch signaling pathway, however, has not received much attention, even though there is good evidence in embryonic development and adult tissue regeneration (i.e. muscle) that the Notch signaling pathway plays a central role in progenitor cell proliferation. In this proposal, we will focus on the Notch and Wnt signaling pathway, in particular how the two pathways orchestrate early stem cell proliferation and differentiation. (1) We will first characterize the Notch and Wnt responsiveness of osteoprogenitor cells within the injury site and map the spatial and temporal expression profile of members of both pathways. (2) We will then inhibit Notch signaling during the early proliferative phase, which will identify the degree t which Notch signaling regulates proliferation and potentially influences subsequent differentiation. (3) In the last aim, we will independently activate Notch and Wnt signaling in viv to define the potential coordinate activity between the two pathways during adult bone stem cells activation. While much effort has been exerted into identifying the effect of a singular growth hormone on bone regeneration, our research seeks to characterize a well-orchestrated interplay between two well-known pathways. This proposal may expose potential therapeutic targets, which may result in the future development of biomimetic treatment algorithms with the goal of enhancing the body's own regenerative capacity. My career goal is to conduct clinically relevant basic research as an orthopaedic clinician scientist. This career development plan and research proposal will allow me to focus my efforts on acquiring the desired skills that are necessary to become a successful clinician scientist. Receiving mentorship from my two highly accomplished primary mentors in addition to the five members of my advisory committee will guarantee my gradual growth into a competitive researcher in the field of bone biology. This expected academic growth in addition to the acquired new skills sets will place me in a prime position to compete for independent R01 funding."

"9604870","Project Summary Young men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for HIV infection in the United States, representing 80% of all infections among youth ages 14-24, and 92% of infections among boys ages 14-19. Despite these risks, the field has not even one HIV prevention intervention shown to be effective in decreasing sexual risks or increasing HIV testing among adolescent MSM (AMSM). Historically, reaching AMSM for HIV prevention has been challenging, given their relative geographic isolation and lack of access to traditional gay congregating spaces (e.g., bars and many gay-related social networking websites). However, our team has developed a novel online platform for delivering interventions to parents of LGB youth that currently sees thousands of visitors each year. HIV prevention advocates have identified parents of AMSM as an untapped resource for reducing HIV risk in this population. Parent-child communication about sex has well-demonstrated associations with adolescent risk behaviors, and interventions with parents of heterosexual youth have been shown to be effective in increasing parent-adolescent communication, and thereby, reducing adolescent health risks. Thus, the goal of the proposed study is to develop an online intervention to increase and improve parent communication with AMSM about sexuality and HIV, with the ultimate goal of decreasing adolescent sexual risk and increasing HIV testing. To achieve this goal, we proposed four specific aims: (1) Identify the ways to best educate, motivate, and guide parents in communicating about sexuality and HIV with their sons by conducting interviews and focus groups with AMSM and their parents, (2) Develop a web-based, multimedia, intervention that motivates and teaches parents how to communicate effectively with their sons about HIV-related topics, (3) Pilot test the acceptability of the intervention and functionality of the system, and (4) Conduct a pilot randomized, controlled trial of the intervention. Aims 1-3 will be achieved by collecting interview and focus group data from AMSM and their parents, and then collaborating with a team of parents and adolescent to synthesize existing data, design the intervention, and test its acceptability and functionality. Aim 4 will be achieved by randomizing parents who come to seek resources on our existing website to receive either our new intervention or control, and then gathering longitudinal, online data from parents in both study arms and their AMSM sons over a 2-4 month period. Importantly, our study team has already demonstrated the feasibility of (a) recruiting parent-AMSM dyads into qualitative research, and (b) utilizing our website to enroll parent-AMSM dyads into longitudinal quantitative research. Thus, our proposal is innovative in that it uses our existing, proven resources to address many of the barriers that have historically plagued research on AMSM and their parents, as well as efforts to intervene with this population. If found to be effective, this would be the first ever HIV prevention intervention shown to work for AMSM ? the population of adolescents who are at highest risk for HIV infection."

"9648686","In this core expression-cloning technologies will be utilized to generate a collection of mAbs that will be  characterized in various contexts by the three projects. Further, arrays of hundreds or thousands of  antibodies will be printed to protein microarrays for rapid screening of mAb or poly-clonal (serum) antibody  epitope targeting. We will clone influenza-specific antibodies from plasmablasts activated after vaccination of  healthy volunteers. As we have shown 50 to 70% of influenza-vaccine induced plasmablasts are influenza  specific. Thus this effort will generate a large library of anti-HA and anti-NA human mAbs to the three or four  vaccine strains. In order to isolate a larger library of NA-reactive antibodies we will use fluorescently labeled  neuraminidase (NA) protein as bait to identify and sort anti-NA memory B cells from human PBMCs from  patients infected with influenza. Finally, we have a substantial collection of human mAbs both cloned in our  laboratory and canonical antibodies from the literature. These antibodies bind to all recent influenza vaccine  strains and to various different proteins (HA, NA, NP, M) and epitopes in the HA-stalk and HA-head regions.  Using microarrays of these printed antibodies we can readily determine the epitopes shared between  recombinant HAs and whole virions. Further, using what we term epitope-shadowing we can screen for  global changes in the epitope specificity of serum samples by competition binding assays. This powerful tool  will be further developed as a platform to use for similar experiments and to identify serum-specificity  signatures correlated with protection (biomarker applications), to bin the paratope of protective and non  protective epitopes typically targeted, and to use as a powerful tool to quickly map epitopes targeted by new  antibodies or sera. The antibody core services will be used by the various projects as follows: Project 1 will  characterize conserved epitopes and mechanisms of neutralization from antibodies targeting both HA and  NA proteins and will use the antibody arrays to screen for epitope specificities. Project 2 will use the antibody  core to generate antibodies to determine how anti-influenza responses become skewed in particular cohorts  and to scrutinize the specificity of novel memory B cell populations. The antibody microarray will be used to  evaluate epitopes targeted by human subjects or by B cell subsets. Project 3 will use the antibodies to Fc  FcR engagement to the mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection from influenza."
"9463461","Community Outreach and Engagement Core (COEC) Abstract The COEC of the Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) engages communities, health care professionals, decision makers and individuals in a collaborative process to select problems that CEET research teams and its network with other Environmental Health Science Core Centers (EHS CCs) can investigate to provide tools that will eliminate or mitigate adverse public health impacts to vulnerable populations. Our regional focus is on the aging infrastructure of post-industrialized cities and the new and unique challenges of rural communities in Pennsylvania that are undergoing rapid industrialization due to hydraulic fracturing for natural gas. Many of the impacted communities meet the criteria of Environmental Justice Communities and are faced with significant health disparities. The COEC engages these communities through a Targeted Community Model in which we learn about community problems first and then tackle environmental health problems. The COEC has a proven track-record in Community-Based Participatory Research (CBRP) and developed a Community-First Communication Model in which results from CBPR are disseminated to the affected community first to empower the community to affect change. The COEC has used this model successfully to build translational research teams which utilize the resources of the Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core and its human population exposure group to design studies and develop a communication plan. The mission of the COEC is further accomplished through the following discrete aims: (i) use the Stakeholders Advisory Board to prioritize COEC activities; (ii) use our Targeted Communities model to communicate environmental health (EH) information in a manner that can improve public health; (iii) communicate EH problems experienced by our community audiences to set the research agenda of the CEET; (iv) educate new health care professionals in EHS to build capacity in occupational environmental medicine to serve communities; (v) translate and disseminate research information into public health knowledge; (vi) advance the field of community engagement by the development of innovative models; (vii) create and disseminate new education materials; (ix) collaborate with other COEC's; and (x) evaluate the success of COEC using logic models. The COEC team is led by Dr. Marilyn Howarth who has >25 years' experience as an occupational and environmental health physician and by Mr. Richard Pepino who has >25 years' experience in environmental policy and regulatory science."
"9453049","Summary Brief periods of neural activity trigger a vascular response with a complex but fairly stable form. This hemodynamic response function (HRF) is extensively exploited in popular functional imaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and reflectance based optical imaging. Proper interpretation and utilization of these imaging techniques requires a detailed understanding the HRF. Moreover, because the brain is continually active, transient responses are likely to be important in normal operation of the healthy brain. Cerebrovascular pathology is likely to affect such transient responses, so a more complete understanding of their normal character will enable their use as diagnostics of incipient or extant pathology.  The physiology and physics of the HRF are not well understood. The standard ?balloon? model incorporates a non-linear compliant element to explain flow and volume changes. However, the venous volume changes of the balloon model have not been confirmed experimentally, and there is now great controversy on the subject. We have developed a model that combines a novel linear flow description with spatially resolved oxygen transport. The flow model includes the inertial dynamics of moving blood, which cannot be neglected in the larger arterioles that mechanically mediate the flow response.  We propose further development of the model, coupled with detailed characterization of the HRF. The model will be expanded to deal with the blood oxygen-level dependent response, and to increase the detail and realism of the flow description. Experimentally, we will use a multi-sensory stimulus protocol with a sensory integration task to evoke the HRF broadly across the brain, and evaluate the responses using high- resolution arterial spin labeling and fMRI to examine the character and variability of these responses within different brain tissues. The results will provide a rich dataset to further test our model and evaluate various hypotheses about neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling."
"9462027","ABSTRACT This PPG has established that dysfunction at multiple stages throughout the lysosomal network (LN), comprised of autophagy and the endosomal-lysosomal (EL) pathway, occurs in Alzheimer?s disease (AD) pathogenesis. A hypothesis throughout the PPG is that increasing the levels of ?-site cleaved carboxyl- terminal fragment of the amyloid-? precursor protein (?CTF) through genetic and environmental AD risk factors, including the ApoE4 allele, cholesterol, and recently identified risk genes found by GWAS, disrupts LN function in early-onset AD and in the more common late-onset AD form. In this project 4 (P4), we focus on autophagy alterations driven by late-onset AD risk factors, investigating particularly the role of the ?CTF and its effects on the LN mediated through rab5 activation. The goals will be attained through a comprehensive transcriptomic approach that evaluates all stages of autophagy in homogeneous vulnerable neuronal populations using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatics applied to custom-designed pipelines of autophagy and lysosomal genes. These informative and functionally predictive gene analysis pipelines have been confirmed, and are complemented by immunological and biochemical functional analyses of autophagy, including the use of a novel neuron-specific autophagy reporter-construct mouse. Our experimental design overcomes issues associated with the marked cellular heterogeneity of brain tissue, where vulnerable neurons are intermixed with spared neuronal populations and glia, which we show in our preliminary data to have different autophagy pathway programs. The strong validation of this approach derives from our longstanding investigations of autophagy and lysosomal pathways in AD and supports its innovative application to in vivo studies involving specific vulnerable neuronal populations. In conjunction with P1-P3, we will employ a cohort of models, including a wild-type APP overexpressing mouse, a novel rab5 transgenic mouse that displays endosome morphologic and behavioral abnormalities, and humanized ApoE4 mice, among others that display LN deficits relevant to AD, enabling us to test multiple hypotheses related to the pathogenic effects of ?CTF on the autophagy and EL pathways. In Aim 1 we will evaluate the function of all stages of autophagy in vivo through a novel combination of cell-specific transcriptomics, tracking of fluorescence reporter constructs, and parallel immunochemical functional analyses in vulnerable cholinergic, hippocampal, and cortical neurons. Increasing autophagy turnover and inducing lysosomal biogenesis is an appealing therapeutic approach for improving the efficiency of the LN in vulnerable cells, and modalities known to induce autophagy include calorie restriction (CR). In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that the benefits of calorie restriction (CR) and an established CR mimetic, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), involve increased autophagy turnover and lysosomal biogenesis in vivo, enhancing clearance of substrates by lysosomes including ?CTF, thus averting pathogenic consequences."
"9326952","Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) is a rare pediatric brain tumor for which no cure or efficacious therapies exist. Recently, novel mutations in ACVR1, a BMP pathway receptor, were discovered that commonly co-occur with a K27M mutation in the gene encoding histone H3.1 (H3.1 K27M) in DIPG patient samples. The overall objectives of this proposal are to identify the mechanisms by which mutant ACVR1 and H3.1 K27M contribute to DIPG pathogenesis and to uncover strategies to pharmacologically target these mutations or downstream signaling molecules. Our central hypothesis is that mutant ACVR1 and H3.1 K27M contribute to brainstem gliomagenesis by activating the Stat3 and Notch signaling pathways, respectively. We plan to use novel genetically engineered mouse models representing primary tumors growing in their native microenvironment to interrogate the effects of both mutant ACVR1 and H3.1 K27M on gliomagenesis, proliferation, apoptosis, cell differentiation, self- renewal, cell motility, and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. We will also use both genetic and pharmacologic tools to determine the contributions of Stat3 and Notch to ACVR1-mediated functions and to H3.1 K27M-mediated functions, respectively. Finally, we will test a panel of ACVR1, Stat3, and Notch inhibitors in vitro and in vivo in both human and murine DIPG models. Once it is understood how ACVR1 mutations and H3.1 K27M contribute to DIPG pathogenesis, the relevant developmental pathways can be manipulated pharmacologically, resulting in new and innovative therapeutic approaches that are based upon the basic biology inherent, and specific, to DIPG. We anticipate these outcomes will have a positive impact by 1) laying the foundation for future pre-clinical and clinical trials for DIPG, 2) characterizing the first genetically engineered mouse models of DIPG driven by mutant ACVR1 and H3.1 K27M, and 3) advancing our understanding of signaling pathway activities that are essential for DIPG growth."

It is expected that, at a minimum, 95% of the students will graduate with BA/BS degrees in STEM and 65% will continue to a graduate program, with 50% continuing to a PhD or MD/PhD degree program within three years of graduation. Program participants will be research active with faculty and this endeavor will result in student presentations and, hopefully, co-authorship of publications. In addition to mentoring and research support, our program offers opportunities for students to improve their grade point averages through Academic Excellence Workshops that provide supplemental support to students enrolled in difficult gatekeeper courses. They will also receive training on and support for their applications to biomedical graduate programs. A seminar serves to help students stay focused and it will allow them to interact with successful scientists who can serve as role models, including former students from the program and IRACDA Scholars. Research Training Workshops will introduce students to important biomedical techniques to expand their biomedical research training. An ethics course is required to ascertain that we prepare responsible scientists.

"9435231","Project Summary Systematic reviews (SRs) synthesize and critically assess bodies of evidence to produce a comprehensive unbiased assessment of what is known. As such, SRs are vital for evidence-based decision-making. However, given the pace of new research, the process of developing an SR remains too slow. One particularly time-consuming step in the process is citation screening, which requires manual review of thousands of abstracts to identify only a small number of relevant studies. Screening such large numbers of studies is necessary because systematic reviewers place a high priority on identifying all relevant studies to avoid bias. Innovative citation screening tools, which utilize text-mining and new sophisticated machine learning methods, represent one potential solution. Abstrackr (Brown University) and EPPI-Reviewer (University College London) are off- the-shelf, web-based citation screening tools designed to improve screening efficiency. Both programs utilize machine- learning techniques to semi-automate the screening process by modeling the probability that each citation will meet criteria for inclusion. This allows efficiency gains through screening prioritization and screening truncation. With screening prioritization, citations are organized for screening from highest to lowest likelihood of inclusion. This allows earlier retrieval of full-text articles and facilitates workflow planning. Organizing citations by likelihood of inclusion also allows reviewers the option of truncating the screening process when remaining citations fall below a certain threshold. While promising, existing studies have predominantly been performed by computer scientists testing individual tools or comparing different modeling algorithms (e.g., various classifiers). To date, no studies have performed a direct comparison of citation screening tools. Similarly, although automatically excluding citations that fall below particular thresholds could substantively improve efficiency, adoption has been low due to concerns that relevant studies could be missed. However, how often studies would be missed and how important such omissions would be remains unknown. To address these knowledge gaps, this project will (1) Compare screening efficiency for two citation-screening tools, Abstrackr and EPPI-reviewer, and (2) Characterize the potential impact of using thresholds to exclude low probability studies automatically. To address aim 1, using citations from 3 large and 6 small completed evidence reports, we will compare Abstrackr to EPPI-Reviewer for citation screening. Using screening prioritization, we will assess what proportion of articles must be screened to identify all included studies (e.g., to achieve 100% sensitivity). For Aim 2, we will explore the potential impact of excluding all citations that fall below particular thresholds during the screening process. We will also assess to what extent missing these studies would alter report conclusions. By characterizing potential efficiency gains from new, innovative, and widely accessible tools, this project can facilitate wider adoption by evidence based practice centers seeking to speed systematic review production."
"9648682","We have compelling new data demonstrating that providing the influenza vaccine in different contexts can induce dramatic shifts in long-term B cell memory to influenza. This important proof of concept suggests that human B cell responses can be re-trained as needed to improve vaccine efficacy. In this project we will explore the mechanism of these observations. The principles gleaned will be important in the development of an improved influenza vaccine. First, in Aim 1, we will explore the role of B cell memory and immune sera in redirecting antibody responses to particular epitopes upon re-exposure to variant influenza strains. Secondly, in Aim 2 we will determine if, like the response to hemagglutinin, a predominance of broadly cross-reactive B cells were activated against neuraminidase upon first exposure to the 2009 pandemic strain of influenza. We will also use novel approaches to determine how stable previously observed biased influenza epitope targeting in human populations is. Finally, we have identified what we believe is an epidemic-memory B cell differentiation that we hypothesize persists at high numbers for months rather than permanently, and provides immediate protection due to the highly likely re-exposure that will occur during an epidemic. We believe that these memory cells, when induced by vaccination with relevant or irrelevant strains, can substantially impact responses to variant influenza strains occurring in the near future in an original-antigenic sin (OAS) fashion. In fact, these cells may account for the dramatic shifts that we observed for some but not all members of our cohort, leading to responses with either greater breadth or more strain-specific responses. We will explore the phenotype and function of these cells. Further, by determining the specificity of the B cells from this population we will directly determine the impact of these memory cells upon re-exposure to a divergent influenza strain. Understanding the types and stages of B cell memory will allow better targeting of the influenza vaccine response. Finally, in the context of these studies we will develop new technologies such as our epitope-shadowing approach using our novel mAb microarray platform to allow rapid and global screening of both monoclonal and polyclonal (serum) epitope targeting. We will also generate a large panel of human mAbs against influenza. These antibodies may identify epitopes important for developing a broadly protective vaccine or the mAbs themselves may have therapeutic potential."
"9461611","The Center's Central Hypothesis posits that layer 3 pyramidal cells (PCs) in subjects with schizophrenia  have a cell type-autonomous pathology that is refiected in altered somatodendritic morphology and that  differs in severity across regions in the cortical visual working memory and attention network. These  abnormalities of layer 3 PCs result in locally reduced excitatory drive, refiected in reduced markers of  metabolic activity in layer 3 PCs and reduced activity-dependent markers in reciprocally-connected layer 3  parvalbumin (PV)-expressing basket cells. This model leads to several novel predicfions. For example, that  deflcits in layer 3 PC somal volume and dendritic spine density are present in mulfiple cortical regions, but  moderated by region-specific factors (Aim 1). To date only limited analyses of primary visual cortex (VI)  have been conducted, and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has not been examined. Our preliminary data  indicate that impairments in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are associated with reduced markers of  local network activity within PCs and PV basket cells. Functional data indicate impaired activity within VI and  PPC during visual tasks in subjects with schizophrenia. Thus, our model predicts that markers of neuronal  acfivity are also altered within VI and PPC (Aim 2). Finally, reducfions in pre-synapfic proteins such as  synaptophysin and synapsini, that are known to impair glutamatergic bouton funcfion, behavior, and  cognifion, have been previously observed in schizophrenia. Our model predicts that reductions in these  proteins predominate in intracortical glutamatergic boutons within layer 3 across V1-PPC-DLPFC and are  posifively correlated with the magnitude of the underlying somatodendrific abnormalifies within regions in the  network (Aim 3). This project serves as an essenfial link between disease-related molecular findings in these  same neurons, layers and regions (Project 1) and abnormal information processing in disease (Project 5).  This project will constrain the interpretation of how normative functional connectivity (Projects 4 & 5) is  altered in disease (Project 5) and will guide predicfions for future studies using markers specific for  projections between PPC and DLPFC that may be identified in Project 3."

This combines an integrated service model (one stop shopping) with an  active and novel outreach strategy. Thus, rather than taking a traditional approach, in which requests for  data analysis services are often initiated too late (after data are already generated, when one can no  longer modify study design). Core E proactively engages with researchers. It does so by assigning core  members to attend lab meetings (house calls) and to assist at the very earliest stages of study planning.  Building on this innovative approach, five Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will provide biostatistics support  for experimental design and data analysis. Aim 2 will provide bioinformatics and computational biology  support, and will also promote interdisciplinary collaborations by supporting new applications of  computationally-intensive methods to HIV/AIDS research (e.g., analyses of imaging data for our CNS  Reservoirs/Aging SWG, and structural modeling for our RNA Biology SWG). Aim 3 will provide data  management and informatics services, and Aim 4 will provide education and training services. Finally,  Aim 5 will leverage other available resources (including methodological research grants/projects and  institutional support) to create novel statistical, computational, modeling and bioinformatics tools for  HIV/AIDS research."
"9680669","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant disorder that results in a cone-rod dystrophy form of retinal degeneration. The mutation inherited by SCA7 patients is a CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the ataxin-7 gene. The SCA7 mutation results in production of a toxic polyQ-expanded ataxin-7 protein. Since the toxic gene product drives all subsequent disease pathology in SCA7, the most attractive therapeutic paradigm is to terminate expression of the mutant gene product. Here we propose continuation of a translational research program intended to yield therapeutic agents for SCA7 retinal disease, and potentially for related SCAs caused by CAG repeat expansion mutations. We are pursuing ataxin-7 gene silencing using a strategy that has already been successfully applied to reduce the expression of a toxic protein: oligonucleotide-based knock-down. To achieve the goals of this translational research program, we have created an academic-industrial partnership. In close collaboration with ISIS Pharmaceuticals, a company that specializes in anti-sense oligonucleotide (ASO) production and single-stranded siRNA (ss-siRNA) creation, we identified leads that markedly knock-down ataxin-7 expression. Based upon these in vitro results, we selected leads for in vivo validation, and performed pilot intra-vitreal injections in wild-type mice. These pilot intra-vitreal injections yielded robust (> 0%) knock-down of ataxin-7 expression for eyes injected with anti-ataxin-7 ASO, in comparison to eyes injected with diluent. Further pilot studies in SCA7 knock-in mice resulted in significant reductions in ataxin-7 protein aggregates in retinal photoreceptor cells in treated eyes. We also identified CAG-repeat targeting oligonucleotides for allele-selective targeting of polyQ-expanded ataxin-7 in fibroblast cell lines from patients. We therefore propose two aims: 1) Based upon efficacy of knock-down and ocular toxicity parameters, we will select one ataxin-7 ASO and perform intra-vitreal injections of ataxin-7 ASO in the right eye and control ASO/diluent in the let eye of SCA7 knock-in mice to determine if ASO delivery can prevent or ameliorate SCA7 retinal degeneration. Read-outs will include ataxin-7 aggregation, retinal histology, and visual function. Once we identify an efficacious ataxin-7 ASO, we will repeat the trial to confirm efficacy, compare gene expression alterations in ASO-treated and control-treated eyes, determine if ASO delivery in symptomatic SCA7 mice can stop or reverse disease progression, and evaluate the utility of the ataxin-7 ASO as a therapy for SCA7 cerebellar degeneration. 2) After we select a CAG-repeat targeting oligonucleotide, we will test if the oligonucleotide can prevent or ameliorate retinal degeneration in SCA7 knock-in mice, and then advance the oligonucleotide for confirmatory studies, transcriptome expression analysis, symptomatic intervention trials, and evaluation as a therapy for SCA7 neurodegeneration, applying similar experimental strategies as with the ataxin-7 ASO. At the conclusion of this project, we will be well positioned to proceed with IND-enabling studies with our industrial collaborator, as a prelude to a clinical trial in humn SCA7 patients."
"9465478","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this revised application is to determine the mechanisms by which sickle cell disease (SCD) increases inflammation and vasocongestion. Recently we reported that SCD increases circulating levels of High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) and that nearly 70% of the total TLR4 reporter activity in SCD plasma could be inhibited by anti-HMGB1 neutralizing antibodies. HMGB1 is a nuclear binding protein that aids in regulating gene expression and maintaining DNA structure. However, HMGB1 can also be released from activated neutrophils and injured cells and tissues. Once released, HMGB1 acts as a Damaged-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP) that, depending on its thiol oxidation status, activates the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) or Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4). Although it is well-established that SCD increases neutrophil counts, neutrophil activation as well as tissue injury during vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), events that are all associated with HMGB1 release little is known about the role of HMGB1 in SCD. Here we hypothesize that SCD increases HMGB1 release which impairs EC function to increase vasocongestion. To test this hypothesis 3 aims are proposed. Aim 1 determines how SCD increases HMGB1 release and the impact this has on pathophysiology at baseline and after hypoxia\reoxygenation (H\R) injury. Sickle mice will be depleted of neutrophils and effects determined at baseline and after H/R injury with respect to HMGB1 activity and changes in levels of HMGB1, cf Hb and hemin. Aim 2 determines how HMGB1 impairs EC function with respect to vasodilatation, inflammation and adhesion. HMGB1 will be depleted in mice and effects of depletion determined with respect to vasodilatation; sVCAM-1, sICAM-1 and sE-selectin to assess EC injury and inflammation; and, with respect to WBC\RBC - EC interactions. Aim 3 determines the effects of oxidative stress in SCD on rates of HMGB1 thiol oxidation. The studies will determine how chronic states of oxidative stress in SCD mediate HMGB1 oxidation thiol status and the impact that HMGB1 oxidation status has on RAGE and TLR4 activity, inflammation and VOC. In vivo and ex vivo studies will reveal how targeting oxidative enzymes modulates HMGB1 oxidation status and isoform specific downstream signaling and pathophysiology. Studies will be performed in mice, in EC cultures and our RAGE & TLR4 reporter cell lines. The hypothesis tested is that oxidative stress in SCD accelerates oxidation of reduced HMGB1 to HMGB1 disulfide, establishing chronic states of TLR4 activation and increased IRF5 nuclear translocation, a potent signal for EC injury and death. These studies are designed to determine if and the extent to which the HMGB1-TLR4-IRF5 pathway is involved in the mechanisms by which SCD impairs EC function and increases vasocongestion. Our studies will provide some of the first evidence linking oxidative stress in SCD to the release and oxidation of HMGB1. Knowledge gained from our studies will help in the design of new therapeutic strategies for targeting HMGB1 to improve vascular health and limit vaso-occlusive crises in SCD."
"9455774","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although considerable insight has been gained into mechanisms by which allergic sensitization and respiratory infections influence airway inflammation, the contribution and relationship of psychological stress, and more directly, specific brain circuitry activated by stress, to the inflammatory processes in asthma, remain largely unknown and an unmet need in asthma management. Our proposal is designed to first establish the contribution of airway inflammation to activation of specific stress-responsive brain neurocircuits and then the contribution of these neurocircuits to the regulation of inflammation in asthma. We have shown that specific stress-responsive brain circuitry in asthma, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain in asthmatic patients, is activated in response to an allergic reaction in the lung to inhaled antigen (AG) and involves brain regions known to be activated by stress. The investigative groups involved in this application process have extensive experience to probe brain-lung interactions in asthma and to establish how airway inflammation activates stress-sensitive neurocircuits of the brain, and how these stress-sensitive circuits, in turn, regulate airway inflammation. In addition, new preliminary information indicates that the interleukin (IL)-1?/IL-17 pathway may be of central importance to inflammation, brain activation, and stress responses. This proposal will test the hypothesis that activation of stress-sensitive brain circuitry contributes to the pathophysiology of asthma by integrated processes: the neural response to an afferent signal which is activated by allergic inflammation in the airway (Specific Aim 1); and an integration of this afferent signal with the ongoing activity in stress-responsive brain neurocircuits to generate an efferent signal to further enhance airway inflammation (Specific Aim 2). The first specific aim will establish that airway inflammation causes an afferent signal to activate stress-sensitive neurocircuitry. Procedures have been developed to activate airway inflammation by bronchoscopy with antigen challenge and retrieval of bronchial lavage fluid, airway cells, and bronchial brushings to establish that airway inflammation activates the brain (fMRI) and its stress-sensitive circuits. Specific Aim 2 will determine the brain pathways, using positron emission tomography (PET), that, when activated by stress, integrate this activity with an afferent inflammatory signal and initiate a subsequent efferent signal that modulates the inflammatory response in the airway. This aim will use a well-validated laboratory psychological stress challenge and, as proposed, will enhance the efferent airway inflammatory response, via activity in stress-sensitive brain circuits. These studies will establish the role and contribution of stress-responsive neurocircuits to asthma and identify the molecular mechanisms through which airway inflammation enhances the activity of stress-sensitive brain circuits, as well as how these brain circuits integrate psychological stress into efferent regulatory signals that promote airway inflammation."
"9497759","SUMMARY  Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a significant parasitic disease in the north-east of India. It is caused  by the intracellular protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani and is characterized by immune  dysfunction that can result in VL patients being more susceptible to secondary infections. There is  no effective vaccine to prevent or treat VL, and current drug treatment is undermined by cost,  toxicity and the potential development of drug-resistant parasites. We will measure the frequency  and activation status of key immune cells¸ including T cells and monocytes, in the blood, bone  marrow and skin of VL patients before, during and after drug treatment. In addition, we will  characterize transcriptional and metabolic signatures in these cell populations to identify novel  molecules to target for therapeutic advantage or to identify individuals likely to relapse or develop  disease complications. In addition, we will test whether specific immune responses against  parasite antigens can be used to identify individuals with asymptomatic infections.  There is a great need to better understand host immune responses in VL patients. The  identification of immune markers that detect T cells and/or monocytes that have recently  encountered parasite antigen in our studies will allow us to monitor and measure parasite burden  amongst populations in VL endemic regions, and would represent a major achievement for this  Project, as well as providing a valuable diagnostic tool for VL elimination Programs. We will work  with colleagues in Project 1 to identify asymptomatic individuals for immune studies, as well as to  identify novel markers that can be used to identify these individuals who would not normally be  recognized by conventional means of detection. In addition, work on Phlebotomine sand fly  vectors conducted in Project 2 will help guide experiments aimed at better understanding immune  responses in the skin proposed in this project. For example, we will investigate the influence of the  local immune environment in the skin on the ability of the host to transmit infection to a sand fly.  Thus, our Project not only focuses on the impact of VL on the host, but also on transmission and  maintenance of disease in the region, and as such, will generate important complimentary data for  other Projects within the Program. Elimination of VL is considered an achievable goal, and the  work proposed in this Project will help to achieve this. Our research also has direct implications  and applications for many diseases because the immunoregulatory and metabolic pathways we  study are likely to be present in other chronic diseases, and our discoveries will thus have broad  applications in medicine."
"9462701","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant concentrates on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein misfolding and ER stress-induced endocrine cell death, using the thyroid gland as a model. Diseases of this kind affect every organ system. The thyroid is an ideally-suited model system in which to study this problem because, unlike the situation in pancreatic beta cells (in which compromised insulin production leads to a vicious cycle of detrimental effects on beta cell survival caused by glucoliptoxicity), when thyroid hormone production is compromised, the hypothyroidism itself does not itself limit compensatory thyroid gland expansion. Normally, the thyroid gland synthesizes thyroid hormone, which is essential for control of metabolism, development, and brain function. A limited number of selectively-expressed thyroid gene products are involved in thyroid hormone production, including thyroglobulin (Tg). The thyroid can devote up to 50% of total protein synthesis to this one protein. Cells such as thyrocytes have a supercharged protein secretion pathway with tonic physiological ER stress.  At least 50 Tg mutations are responsible for autosomal recessive congenital hypothyroidism - all of these produce proteins entrapped within the ER. Many Tg mutations are associated with goiter, but for others, compensatory expansion of the thyroid gland is blocked. We hypothesize that for the latter group of Tg mutants, proteotoxic thyroid cell death limits compensatory tissue expansion. In this application, we provide new mechanistic data supporting this hypothesis, highlighting the thyroid gland as the best in vivo system available in which to study ER stress-mediated endocrine cell failure. Quantifying cell death is straightforward in the thyroid system, and importantly, the loss of compensatory tissue expansion can be easily followed in real time, noninvasively, in living animals. Our Specific Aims for the next 5 years are: 1. To define region-dependent effects of the Tg protein on its transport and proteotoxicity; 2. To explore in vivo therapies that facilitate cell survival in the face of ER overload (from misfolded Tg); and 3. To exploit Tgn-/- mice to examine classical ER stress response in thyroid cell death, and to uncover a previously unidentified precursor protein for T4 synthesis."
"9452962","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary care offers a familiar and accessible clinical venue for patients affected by obesity to receive evidence- based lifestyle interventions for weight management. However, there are numerous barriers to the implementation of such programs in primary care, and previous interventions delivered by primary care physicians or other members of the healthcare team have often demonstrated modest and temporary weight loss for patients. Weight loss treatment delivered by trained peer coaches may offer a viable and effective alternative to address weight management in primary care. While peer coaches have successfully delivered behavioral interventions for other chronic conditions (e.g., type 2 diabetes) as well as obesity interventions in non-clinical settings (e.g., community centers), research is lacking on the effectiveness of translating peer- delivered weight loss interventions to primary care. Our preliminary work suggests that a weight loss intervention delivered in primary care by peer coaches can achieve clinically significant reductions in weight, is feasible for adoption in primary care, and is well-received by patients. In this application, we propose to conduct an 18-month randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of obesity treatment that includes either: 1) in-person and telephone-based contacts with peer coaches (peer coach treatment), or 2) routine contact with a primary care provider plus self-directed intervention materials (standard care). This weight loss trial will include 375 obese adults randomized from 10 primary care practices. The primary outcome will be changes in body weight at month 18. Secondary outcomes will include key patient-centered outcomes, including quality-of-life, physical and social functioning, mood, and treatment satisfaction. The cost- effectiveness of the peer coach intervention will also be evaluated. This is a novel investigation of the effectiveness and sustainability of an innovative alternative for obesity treatment delivery in primary care. If the peer coach intervention proves effective, it would have significant clinical and public health implications for patients, clinicians, and health systems. These potential benefits include: 1) improvement of clinical and psychosocial outcomes for patients, 2) increased treatment options for primary care providers to manage the care of obese patients, and 3) reduced healthcare utilization and costs."

The Core serves all Projects and is essential to their success."
"9458733","The mission of the Pilot & Feasibility Study (P&F) Program is to provide initial support for new investigators, for  established investigators to explore new directions, and to enable the Einstein-Mount Sinai Diabetes Research  Center (ES-DRC) to attract scientists from other disciplines to diabetes research. The P&F Program is a vital  component of the ES-DRC and has successfully promoted numerous new research endeavors in diabetes-  related areas. This program constitutes a key interface among the Einstein, Mount Sinai and other regional  academic communities at large, and serves as a major attraction in the recruitment of faculty and staff. Over  the past 37 years the Center funded 113 feasibility studies from a pool of 449 applications (funding rate of  25.1%). These studies also include targeted efforts in this project period to increase the number of applications  funded in our regional center at both the basic, clinical and translational diabetes efforts. We anticipate funding  7 Pilot & Feasibility grants at steady state, alternating between 4 new awards and 3 continuing awards, each  year; typically, projects are funded for two years if sufficient progress is shown after the first year. The P&F  study program has enabled recipients to obtain data and publications that constituted the basis for successful  applications for extramural support. Under the same administrative umbrella as the Pilot & Feasibility program,  we established a microgrant award program that provides specific support for the use of ES-DRC Core  facilities. Last year, the microgrant program funded 8 awards out of 19 submitted applications. In addition, we  also partner with the Einstein Clinical and Translational Science Award on a catalytic seed grant to support  diabetes-specific translation research. These value added programs further enhance diabetes directed  research efforts. To continue these established and new initiatives within the P&F program, we will: 1)  advertise and organize the yearly P&F grant competition cycle; 2) support mechanisms for interaction and  collaboration among established researchers in diabetes and related areas and for those who are new to the  field; 3) provide mentoring and guidance for investigators who are new to diabetes research to facilitate  generation of preliminary data with the goal of successful applications for NIH funding and other funding  sources; 4) communicate responsibilities and opportunities to P&F awardees by integrating them into ES-DRC  activities; 5) provide $10,000 of free use of each ES-DRC Biomedical Core services directly related to the  funded P&F project; and 6) manage the institutionally microgrant and Catalytic Seed Grant Award programs in  diabetes and metabolism."
"9509406","Hormone Assay & Analytical Services Core (HAASC): Project Summary/Abstract The purpose of the Hormone Assay & Analytical Services Core (HAASC) is to provide to investigators assays to measure hormones, cytokines, amino acids (Specific Activity & concentrations), lipids/lipoproteins, nucleotides and markers of oxidant stress in biologic fluids and tissue samples, and more recently glucose (enrichment and isotopomer distribution) in plasma and tissue samples. The services provided by the HAASC and its two subcores (Oxidative Stress Subcore and Lipid Subcore) require unique instrumentation and involve rigorous standardization of procedures. It is neither practical nor economically reasonable to establish these assays in individual laboratories. The consolidation of services into one Core laboratory provides investigators with efficient, high quality, low cost analyses. All services are tailored to meet the needs of the specific investigator in that the exact protocol followed may differ depending on the analysis desired by the investigator and the sample volume to be analyzed. Through training and education, investigators become more aware of the various services offered and how these services might address specific areas of interest. Finally, an important function of the Core is method development, which not only enhances the spectrum of services offered but ultimately also increases efficiency by providing researchers with the opportunity to expand their research programs. The core provides space, equipment, and personnel for sample analysis. Investigators pay a fee-for-service that covers the cost of reagents, supplies, pro-rated service contracts for equipment, and a percentage of personnel salary. The Core also serves as a valuable resource for all investigators without ready access to wet-lab research space and personnel. Core services utilize modern instrumentation run by experienced research assistants in a consistent, quality-controlled environment. This Core works closely with another VDRTC Core, the Metabolic Physiology Shared Resource, to develop standard operating procedures to facilitate translation of this technology to VDRTC investigators performing in vivo and in vitro studies. Those investigators rely on the Core and Subcore directors and their staff for advice on how to collect and process samples collected during in vivo studies. The Hormone Assay and Analytical Services Core provides essential services to VDRTC investigators that allow them to perform important and innovative research. The HAASC has demonstrated its ability to develop and modify assays to meet the evolving needs of VDRTC investigators."
"9625306","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The objective of the proposed research is to develop new technology for a Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid (W-ROMA) for the visually impaired. The W-ROMA is a hand-worn assistive device that provides assistance to a visually impaired individual in effectively grasping an object. Thanks to the onboard computer vision methods, the W-ROMA is capable of detecting a target object, determining the hand-object misalignment, and conveying to the wearer, via natural human-device interfaces, the desired hand motion for hand-object alignment. The W-ROMA will contribute to the independent lives of the visually impaired in twofold: First, it helps the visually impaired with independent travel by enabling them to identify a movable obstacle and manipulate the obstacle to make a passage. Second, it assists the visually impaired in effectively grasping an object for non-navigational purpose. The PIs will involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project and use the proposed project activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision and human-robot interaction methods that support accurate and effective object grasping for the visually impaired for their independent daily lives. These methods include: (1) a new real-time object recognition method; (2) an innovative hand-object alignment mechanism; (3) a novel hybrid tactile display system for object shape rendering; and (4) a computationally efficient device localization method. The proposed solutions can be encapsulated in a hand-worn robotic device. The W-ROMA will provide new co-robotic functions for the visually impaired. The PIs have performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision and tactile display methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the research will positively impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the proposed methods can be applied to other small robotic systems that have a wide range of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the PI's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering."
"9463491","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A history of early life stress is an important risk factor for depressive and anxiety disorders and a range of poor health outcomes. Alterations in the neuroendocrine and immune systems, key pathways in the neurobiological response to stress, are involved in the stress-induced changes that are linked to depressive and anxiety disorders. Recent work indicates that epigenetic modifications to genes in these pathways may be a central mechanism of the effects of childhood adversity. Gene methylation is a stable form of epigenetic modification that reduces gene transcription. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which regulates neuroendocrine function through a negative feedback mechanism and contributes to the modulation of immune function, has been the topic of most research on this subject. There is great interest in developing peripheral blood biomarkers of risk for disorders. Abnormalities of endocrine and inflammatory function in peripheral blood can shed light on stress-related immune, vascular, and metabolic abnormalities, and there is some evidence of correspondence between peripheral and central gene regulation for some genes. Multiple genes in the glucocorticoid and inflammatory-signaling pathways are likely involved in the response to childhood adversity. Data on effects of stress exposure on adrenocortical function in MDD and PTSD are mixed with respect to the nature and direction of effects. Studies of the long-term consequences of childhood adversity in adults are limited by recall and judgment biases, a mixture of types of maltreatment, and lack of data on developmental timing. In addition, variability in the literature on adrenocortical function in MDD and PTSD necessitates a greater understanding of the nature of phenotypes and mechanisms involved. The goal of this proposal is to study the effects of chronic childhood adversity on endophenotypes including methylation of genes in the glucocorticoid and inflammatory-signaling pathways, basal and provoked measures of neuroendocrine and immune function, and glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity, as well as phenotypes including measures of coping and behavioral/emotional responses to stress, depressive and anxiety disorder symptoms and diagnose, and measures of somatic symptoms and health. These measures will be tested in a clearly articulated model to yield specific knowledge about the mechanisms of risk for stress-related disorders."
"9460342","Project Summary/Abstract  Alzheimer's disease (AD) afflicts 6 million people in the USA, and the number of AD patients will double by 2050 if no cure is identified. The clinical dementia of AD is coupled to a distinct pathology, with ?-amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and synaptic loss. Synapses are essential for cognitive function, and their loss is well established as the major structural correlate of cognitive impairment in AD. An early event in AD pathogenesis, synaptic failure is detectable in individuals with the prodromal stage of MCI. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging is increasingly employed in studies of AD, using tracers for glucose metabolism, ?- amyloid, and neurofibrillary tangles. However, currently, there are no PET radioligands that directly image synaptic density in vivo, which would be of high utility in studies of AD as well as in monitoring potential therapies. One suitable molecular target for a synaptic density imaging agent is the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2), an essential vesicle membrane protein, with one of its isoforms, SV2A, ubiquitously expressed in virtually all synapses. We recently developed 11C-UCB-J as a promising radioligand for quantitative measurement of SV2A with PET. In our pilot first-in-human SV2A PET studies in healthy subjects, we found that 11C-UCB-J has the potential to be an excellent PET tracer for quantitative imaging of SV2A in the human brain, and can act as a general-purpose tool for measuring synaptic vesicle density. We propose to apply 11C-UCB-J with human imaging studies in AD. In Aim 1, we will quantify SV2A using bolus/infusion delivery on the High Resolution Research Tomography (HRRT) and examine SV2A density in AD compared to healthy controls (HC). We hypothesize that 11C-UCB-J will reveal decreased SV2A binding in the AD brain with a pattern that may differ from the cortical regions previously validated for 18F-FDG. All subjects will also be evaluated for amyloid status and the effect of overall amyloid status on SV2A binding will be determined. In Aim 2, we will compare group and individual differences in SV2A density to differences in glucose metabolism measured with 18F-FDG. Regional patterns of deficits will be compared to HC for the 2 tracers. We hypothesize that the magnitude of reduction in specific binding of 11C-UCB-J in AD compared to HC will be greater than that found with 18F-FDG. Further, we will correlate the magnitude of reduction in synaptic density and glucose metabolism with neuropsychological test performance. Aim 3 compares the group and individual differences in amyloid distribution from 11C-PIB to SV2A-PET as well as FDG-PET, with the expectation that patterns of synaptic loss produced by 11C-UCB-J will differ from that of amyloid PET, particularly in the earlier phases of the AD spectrum. In summary, this project will take the first critical steps to validating a novel imaging biomarker of synaptic density for studies in AD and other neuropsychiatric disorders."
"9653881","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Anticipated Impacts on Veteran's Healthcare: Decision support, surveillance, and quality care initiatives have incredible potential to increase the health of veterans. The rich clinical data contained in the electronic health record enables development of these applications; however, much of that data is locked in free-text reports and remains inaccessible to computerized applications. Natural language processing (NLP) can be applied to provide structured output from free-text input. The VA has been at the forefront of developing NLP techniques within the VHA.  Background: A new generation of tools is needed to realize the vision of effective use and analysis of free-text clinical records for both improving care quality and informing clinical research. Clinical natural language  processing tools have been developed for classifying, extracting, and summarizing information from narrative  clinical texts, in support of diverse tasks including the identification of patients with nosocomial infections,  phenotype-genotype correlation, and selection of patient cohorts for research studies. The VA has been a leader in developing NLP capability, with the hope of implementing NLP in system-facing, patient-facing, and team-facing applications being developed in hi2 HMP and iEHR. Many NLP tools and components are already being developed and hosted on Veteran's Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) (Project 1).  Unfortunately, a large gap between development and clinical/research practice limits applicability-most  applications require customization of NLP tools to specific domains, NLP tasks often require the combination of  multiple (often incompatible) tools, and there is a need to integrate external displays to aid interpretation.  Advances in human-computer interaction and information visualization suggest approaches that can help overcome many of these limitations. A growing body of experience with interactive visualizations of clinical data provides multiple models of how abstracted information from clinical records might best be displayed to users, while extensive experience in fields such as end-user programming and user-centered design provides guidance on how some of the shortcomings in clinical NLP application might be addressed.  Objective: We envision a flexible, user-centered development environment that will provide VA clinicians and medical researchers with the ability to customize and configure NLP and visualization components with little or no NLP-specific expertise or custom software development. As shown in Figure 1, we will build upon a solid  foundation of successful VA NLP components (Project 1) developed largely by members of this CREATE team  to realize this goal, applying user-centered design and evaluation techniques to address the gap between  existing NLP technology and the needs of end users (providers and researchers in projects 3 and 4). The resulting development environment will allow non-NLP experts to customize, investigate, and apply NLP to clinical tasks and to develop visual interfaces that integrate and display EHR data.  Methods: Consistent with the entire INFORMED CREATE, our approach is a user-centered approach in which the data needs of users are considered in the context of their clinical workflow. Users for this project are researchers and providers in Projects 3 and 4 seeking to develop applications for extracting, analyzing, and displaying structured and unstructured data from the EHR. The development environment will be a general-purpose toolkit for researchers developing diverse types of displays for many different domains."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although acetaminophen is the most common drug for treating pain and fever, and also the most common cause of life threatening drug-induced liver damage, there are no tests that specifically diagnose a liver-injury from an overdose. The object of this grant is to complete the development of AcetaSTAT(r), an innovative new method to diagnose an acetaminophen overdose. The new test was developed by Acetaminophen Toxicity Diagnostics LLC (ATD) in conjunction with the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) and the Arkansas Children's Hospital Research Institute (ACHRI). The advantage of AcetaSTAT(r) is that, unlike existing tests, it is fast, easy and specific to acetaminophen toxicity. This will allow clinicians to quickly and accurately prescribe the correct treatment that will help patients and reduce costs. The proposed work will result in ATD, a privately held company, obtaining FDA clearance of AcetaSTAT(r) so that it can be made available to practicing physicians. The proposed work will: 1) develop the final version of AcetaSTAT(r) using a monoclonal antibody, 2) produce AcetaSTAT(r) in a good manufacturing practices (GMP) laboratory, and 3) test the clinical performance of AcetaSTAT(r) in a wide range of patient exposures to acetaminophen.

A concerted action to further scale-up the response is required in order to meet the 90- 90-90 targets by 2020 and achieve the global goal of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030. Scientific research needs to continue to help define the most effective ways to implement prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, including in the context of the challenges associated with prevention and retention in care of key populations and young people, and the changing nature of the epidemic, particularly with regard to aging populations on long-term treatment, the interactions with cardiovascular diseases, cancer and other non-communicable diseases, both in the context of generalized and of concentrated epidemics. Significant innovation is required to realize this agenda against a background of diminishing resources, multiple competing priorities and little time. The 22nd International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2018) will build on multiple recent developments across the spectrum of the HIV response, explore ways to take effective interventions to scale, and focus attention on remaining information, programming, and financing gaps by region and by population. The scientific program will emphasize the latest evidence with close attention to the perspectives of affected communities and to the potential to harness advances in service delivery methods, technology and data systems to reach the key linked goals of epidemic control and universal access to treatment. AIDS 2018 will take place in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on 23-27 July 2018. Anticipated attendance is 15,000+ HIV scientists, clinicians, policy makers, civil society, community and private sector representatives. As the conference will give particular attention to the expanding HIV epidemics in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, strong participation of scientists and implementers from this region is expected. The specific aims of AIDS 2018 are to: 1. Bring together the world?s experts in HIV and related fields to advance scientific knowledge, present new  research findings, and enhance global scientific and community collaborations in synergy with other health  and development sectors to ensure timely progress towards reaching universal access and retention goals; 2. Promote human rights-based and evidence-informed HIV responses that are tailored to the needs of  particularly vulnerable groups including adolescents and young adults, women and girls in high-burden  settings, people living with HIV, displaced populations, men who have sex with men, people in closed  settings, people who use drugs, sex workers, and transgender people; 3. Highlight the critical role and address gaps in innovative, high impact and scaled combination HIV  prevention tools, strategies, and approaches, in particular among young people in all their diversity, and  their integration into a range of health care settings; 4. Advance research into the interactions between HIV and non-communicable diseases, drawing specifically  on results related to genetically diverse and aging populations in Europe and high-burden countries, and  the integration of HIV into diverse public health settings in a way that retains efficacy; 5. Examine the state of the epidemic and the HIV response in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and other  regions where HIV is still expanding, and in the context of displacement and migration, with a focus on  investments, structural determinants and services. The scientific program will consist of five tracks: A ? Basic and Translational Research; B ? Clinical Research; C ? Epidemiology and Prevention Research; D ? Social and Political Research, Law, Policy and Human Rights; and E ? Implementation Research, Economics, Systems and Synergies with other Health and Development Sectors. Cross-cutting aspects will be covered in plenary talks that also connect the scientific tracks with community and leadership perspectives, and bridging sessions will cut across at least two of the tracks to provide opportunities for multi-disciplinary dialogues. HIV cure research, pediatric and adolescent HIV as well as care for the elderly and other life course-related questions will be tightly integrated into the scientific conference program, including through cross-track sessions. The cost-effectiveness of HIV interventions and options for their integration with other health and social services will be explored both from an implementation science angle and with regard to future research. Finally, AIDS 2018 will provide excellent opportunities for young investigators to engage with their peers at an international level while being exposed to the perspectives of affected communities, policy makers and funders."
"9465530","PROJECT SUMMARY Memories can last the entire lifetime of an organism. Dynamic communication among billions of neurons at synapses underlies information processing and enables the coding and storage of memory. Changes in synapse strength and structure through synaptic plasticity are widely speculated as the cellular basis of memory formation and storage. Studies have identified cellular signaling events and molecular rearrangements underlying the initiation of synaptic plasticity. However, considerably less is known regarding the molecular basis enabling synaptic strength and memories to persist for extended periods of time. While initial synaptic plasticity and long-term memory coding requires protein synthesis, following a period of consolidation, memory storage becomes independent of protein synthesis or neural activity, suggesting that the memory is stored in a remarkably stable molecular entity. During this time, however, most of the individual proteins that are known to make up the synapse will turnover, being degraded and replaced within hours to a few days. Therefore the question remains as to what physical substrates underlie the persistence of long-lasting memories. One possibility is that exceptionally long-lived proteins (LLPs) reside in synapses and act as molecular anchors to maintain the synaptic strength or a network property that defines a given memory. While previous studies have demonstrated the existence of LLPs in the central nervous system, particularly in the nuclei of non-dividing cells, no studies to date have addressed whether such proteins exist at synapses and contribute to the establishment and maintenance of long-term memories. To investigate this hypothesis we designed an unbiased, proteomics-based approach to identify LLPs resident in synapses and characterize their neuronal function. Stable isotope metabolic pulse-chase labeling will be used both in vivo and in vitro to measure the half-lives of the neuronal and synaptic proteomes. These experiments will further be combined with behavioral and pharmacological manipulations to examine how memory formation and neuronal activity influence protein turnover. Identified candidate proteins will be characterized using biochemical, cell-biological, electrophysiological, imaging and behavioral methodologies to determine how these LLPs contribute to synaptic/neuronal function and memory. Within the metabolically active environment of the cell it is known that proteins can undergo oxidative damage. Such damage to LLPs could be a source of vulnerability that may contribute to functional decline during aging. The experiments described in this proposal will significantly contribute to our understanding of LLP functions in the brain and their potential role in for memory formation, long-term storage and age-related cognitive decline."
"9538793","PROJECT SUMMARY ? OVERALL HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain very prevalent, even among aviremic HIV+ individuals treated with CART. In the era of CART, the prevalence of HAND in HIV+ individuals with advanced infection remains around 40-50% [1, 2], and HAND may now be the most common form of young-age neurocognitive impairment globally [1]. Currently there are no uniformly accepted clinical, neuroimaging, or laboratory outcome measures for clinical trials for the treatment of HAND. HIV-related neuroscience research at Johns Hopkins University has focused on this challenging problem, exploring critical pathogenic mechanisms for neurological damage. Despite tremendous efforts to understand the mechanisms underlying the persistence of HAND, no definitive adjunctive therapeutics have yet entered clinical practice. There is also an unfilled need to develop surrogate markers and more robust and simpler screening instruments for HAND, to allow for earlier detection, for tracking of the course of HAND, and improving the efficiency of clinical trials. Until the NIMH Center was established at JHU collaborations had been limited by the lack of a central organizing structure for this type of research, and limited resources to facilitate cross-disciplinary and translational research. The JHU NIMH Center has addressed these needs over the past 11 years and has provided a resource to catalyze interdisciplinary research in HIV neuroscience, with the aim of leading to new therapies. Accomplishments of the Center are highlighted in the Overall Strategy section and in each individual core, and the key accomplishment is our proven ability to move HAND therapeutics from the discovery phase, through animal models, and on to clinical trials, with the ultimate goal of shifting clinical practice."
"9652892","As the most prevalent group of psychiatric diseases, anxiety disorders are chronic and disabling conditions that impose enormous costs on individuals and society. Anxiety disorders have complex polygenic etiologies with poorly understood underlying brain circuitries. Structures in the amygdala such as the basolateral complex are widely implicated in anxiety, but additional regions include insula cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, and hippocampus. Among several candidate genes, NMDA receptors (NMDARs), and GluN2B subunits in particular have been associated with anxiety. However, there is no clear picture of unique or converging molecular mechanisms that underlie these disorders. The lack of a mechanistic understanding precludes the identification of novel therapeutic targets and development of useful mouse models. These factors contribute to languishing efforts to develop drugs for pathological anxiety. This proposal seeks to test a novel molecular pathway that regulates anxiety in rodents, and test whether manipulations of this pathway can be anxiolytic. The hypothesis being tested is that Amyloid Precursor Protein Intracellular Domain Associated-1 (AIDA-1) regulates anxiety-related behaviors by controlling NMDAR function in ventral hippocampus (VH). AIDA-1 is a synaptic protein that controls GluN2B subunit function and NMDAR- dependent plasticity in the hippocampus. Preliminary findings indicate that AIDA preferentially regulates GluN2B function in VH. Behavioral testing reveals that AIDA-1 forebrain knockout mice (AIDA-1 cKO) only display reduced anxiety, and not the deficits in spatial and episodic memory expected from deficits in NMDAR function and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Selective AIDA-1 knockdown in VH, but not in amygdala, recapitulate the reduced anxiety phenotype observed in AIDA-1 cKO mice. Our data support longstanding evidence of VH function in emotionality. The proposed studies will provide insight into AIDA-1 and NMDAR biology, and into functional differences present along the dorso-ventral axis of the hippocampus. Importantly, these experiments will provide insights into anxiety disorders, and may identify novel therapeutic targets for their treatment."
"9453704","EY015128 Project Summary: Retinal remodeling This renewal is based on our discovery that retinal degenerations are two separate diseases. Acute primary photoreceptor degenerations turn into chronic neurodegenerations mimicking brain diseases called ?pro- teinopathies?. The neurodegeneration is unremitting, slowly destroying the neural retina with > 90% loss of retinal neurons, severely impeding rescue. The proposal aims to pro?le proteinopathy molecules; identify net- works underlying metabolic collapse; map the nature and scope of rewiring and neuronal loss, and develop a pigmented Tg P347L rabbit model of human adRP. Aim 1. Pro?le neurodegenerative proteinopathy molecules in the neurodegenerative retina. Hypothesis. Retinal neurodegeneration is a proteinopathy. Outcomes: A comprehensive, proteinopathy ?nger- print spanning 6y of disease progression. Signi?cance. Interventions for blinding diseases require survival of the retina. Neurodegeneration must be overcome. Aim 2. Characterize of the metabolic / signaling collapse of the ND retina. Hypothesis. ND corrupts neuronal signaling and energetics. Outcomes: Metabolome status for all neurons and glial cells spanning 6y of ND. Signi?cance. If neurodegenerative retinas cannot sustain activity, therapeutic in- terventions are destined to fail. Metabolic network mapping may reveal druggable targets. Aim 3. Develop a pathoconnectome spanning mid and late ND. Hypothesis. Neural rewiring in the retina is driven by interactions between survivor and degenerating neurons. Outcomes. The survivorship and connectivity of the ND retina. Signi?cance. Different rescue schemas have different targets and the status of each is critical. Aim 4. Develop a pigmented Tg P347L rabbit for retinal degeneration research. Hypothesis. A pigmented eye is optimal for studying of retinal degenerations. Outcomes. A long lifespan, eco- nomically viable, large-eye pigmented model suitable for the FDA Animal Model Quali?cation Program, imag- ing, and analysis of disease progression, rescue and ND interventions. Signi?cance. Developing therapies for human retinal disorders will eventually have to proceed beyond mouse models. A pigmented rabbit is an ideal platform for intervention testing."
"9644442","The aim of this project is to learn more about the mechanism of neutralization of cross-reactive immune responses to the influenza virus surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, and to investigate the quantitative contribution of these mechanisms to protection. To approach this we will map the epitopes of a large panel of human (in collaboration with Project 2) and mouse cross-reactive anti-neuraminidase antibodies in order to define broadly neutralizing epitopes. Further, efforts will be made to characterize the quantitative contribution of different mechanisms of neutralization of a vast panel of broadly reactive antistalk and anti-neuraminidase monoclonal antibodies (of human and mouse origin, in collaboration with Project 2) and polyclonal sera. This work will involve in vivo imaging as well as a panel of assays that measure inhibition of viral entry/fusion, viral egress, hemagglutinin maturation, neuraminidase inhibition, complement activation and others (Project 3 will focus on antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity). Finally, we use recombinant chimeric hemagglutinin and neuraminidase expressing influenza B viruses to study the impact of polyclonal anti-stalk and anti-neuraminidase responses on influenza virus pathogenesis and transmission in the mouse, guinea pig and ferret model."
"9461039","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neuroblastoma (NB) remains one of the most difficult pediatric cancers to treat, as nearly two-thirds of the patients present with metastasis at the tim of diagnosis. Despite aggressive treatment protocols, `high-risk' NB, stage 4 tumors in children older than 18 months of age and/or MYCN amplification, have dismal overall survival of only 50%. There is a significant gap in the comprehensive understanding of the tumor biology for tumor refractoriness and disease relapse, and therefore, elucidation of signaling mechanisms responsible for the aggressive tumor behavior would be highly significant for development of novel targeted clinical therapies. Members of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily represent the hub of drug development activities and accounts for 40% of all targeted therapies. Our laboratory has previously shown that targeting one such GPCR, gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R) and its ligand GRP inhibited NB tumorigenicity via regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, a key cell survival pathway. During the previous funding period (see Progress Report), we reported that the GRP-R signaling regulates NB metastasis, specifically through activation of AKT2, and downregulation of PTEN, an endogenous negative regulator of AKT. The exact role of the GRP-R signaling and specific AKT isoform, AKT2, in the multi-step NB progression from tissue invasion to distant organ metastasis is yet to be elucidated. Targeting PI3K/AKT2, as well as mTOR, downstream of AKT, axis may be a potential strategy as this pathway regulates tumor vasculature and microenvironment (TME). In this competitive renewal application, we plan to determine the exact mechanisms by which GRP-R/AKT2 axis regulates the formation and maintenance of metastasis-initiating cells and their dissemination to distant organs and facilitate establishment of metastatic lesions. Hence, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that GRP/GRP-R signaling via AKT2 regulates resistance to conventional therapies and formation of metastatic foci, thereby, implicating a critical role for this axis in NB refractoriness and disease relapse. o examine this hypothesis, we propose the following three Specific Aims: 1) Determine the role of GRP-R/AKT2 signaling in inducing resistance to conventional therapies and tumor progression. 2) Determine the role of AKT2 in mediating the oncogenic effects of GRP/GRP-R in refractory and/or metastatic NB. 3) Determine the preclinical efficacy of targeting GRP-R/AKT2 in refractory and/or metastatic NB. Successful completion of our Aims will yield significant new knowledge regarding the mechanisms of GRP/GRP-R mediated NB refractoriness and disease relapse, including the role of cancer stem cell in metastasis as well as the extravasation of tumor cells and their interactions with TME. The aims proposed have direct translational relevance as they address an important molecular mechanism of resistance to conventional therapies and the TME. Finally, preclinical study will further provide important information on the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutics against virulent `high-risk' NB."

"9503794","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brain tumors are the most common cause of oncological death in American children, and medulloblastoma is the most common malignant childhood brain tumor, with over 500 cases diagnosed each year. While therapy for standard-risk patients has resulted in improved outcomes, high-risk patients with Myc oncogene overexpression still do poorly. In addition, there remains significant therapy-related morbidity, particularly in very young patients. Thus, there is a critical need for more effective therapies to combat high Myc expressing medulloblastoma. Using integrated genomic analysis we have recently identified the WEE1 kinase as a potential therapeutic target in medulloblastoma. We demonstrated that WEE1 is over expressed in medulloblastoma patient samples and that inhibition of WEE1 suppresses medulloblastoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In particular Myc overexpressing cells are more sensitive to WEE1 inhibition. However how WEE1 enhances medulloblastoma tumorigenesis is unknown. Further whether Myc driven medulloblastoma can be treated with current clinical inhibitors of WEE1 is not known. Thus the objectives of this proposal are to determine the mechanism of WEE1 activity in medulloblastoma and to provide pre-clinical validation of WEE1 inhibition as a therapeutic approach in Myc driven medulloblastoma. We hypothesize that WEE1 enhances medulloblastoma cell survival by protecting cells from Myc oncogene induced replicative stress and promoting DNA damage repair in response to DNA replication targeted chemotherapeutics. To address the hypothesis the studies in aim one will determine the role of WEE1 in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis by examining the impact of WEE1 expression in Myc expressing medulloblastoma cells, examining how WEE1 co-operates with Myc in transforming human neural stem cells and evaluating the synthetic lethal interaction of Myc expression with WEE1 inhibition. Aim two is designed to establish the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of WEE1 inhibition in vivo using a specific WEE1 inhibitor, MK 1775, that is currently in clinical development. Aim three will identify determinants that mediate synthetic lethality with WEE1 inhibition in medulloblastoma using genome wide RNAi technology and kinase inhibitor high throughput systems. The proposed studies will define how WEE1 regulates medulloblastoma tumorigenesis and establish WEE1 as a novel therapeutic target in medulloblastoma by providing the scientific rationale and preclinical data required for early phase clinical studies. Completion of these studies is expected to impact medulloblastoma therapy by resulting in novel therapeutic strategies incorporating WEE1 inhibition."
"9451284","Summary Over 90,000 individuals in the United States await kidney transplantation. Only about 12,000 will receive a deceased donor transplant each year, and recent efforts to increase deceased donation have been largely unsuccessful. As a result, most candidates on the waiting list have a higher chance of dying than of being offered a deceased donor kidney. Live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) eliminates the wait and offers superior survival, but accounts for fewer than 6,000 additional transplants per year despite a huge potential pool of millions of adults living in the US. Worse, LDKT rates are lowest among Hispanic and African American candidates who account for over 30% of the waitlist. Regardless of race, known barriers to identifying a live donor include lack of education, reluctance to discuss one's illness, and hesitance to ask others to donate. We have developed two novel interventions to address these barriers. The first is a 6-month training program that combines education, advocacy, and instrumental support by pairing candidates with a live donor champion (LDC): a friend, family member, or community member trained to spread awareness of ESRD, LDKT, and the candidate's story throughout their social network. The second is a less-intensive Facebook (FB) app (designed in collaboration with FB leadership) that leverages the broad reach of social media to spread awareness, facilitating FB posts about the candidate's story, providing links to education about ESRD and LDKT, and documenting the candidate's search for a donor through a chronically viral Facebook story. In pilot studies at our center, participants of both interventions were significantly more likely to undergo LDKT compared to matched controls. While encouraging, pilot testing has been non-randomized and limited to our center and its unique patient population. Furthermore, it remains unclear how intense an intervention is necessary, i.e. the less-intense FB approach or the more-intense champion approach. To assess the real- world effectiveness of the LDC program and/or the Facebook app in expanding live donation among a heterogeneous population of waitlist candidates, we now propose to test these interventions at three busy transplant centers that serve a heterogeneous group of largely underserved patients. The relative dearth of deceased donors has caused a profound organ shortage; it is essential to turn to novel efforts that increase live donation. Development and widespread implementation of culturally competent LDC and Facebook App interventions has the potential to increase the overall incidence of LDKT while also addressing disparities in access to LDKT.  "

Publications, conference presentations, annual reports and the internet (http://camrt.stanford.edu/) will continue to form the backbone of our dissemination efforts."
"9476232","ABSTRACT The overall goal of this proposal is to provide me with the skills and expertise necessary to launch my career in translational medical research in the field of urologic disease, particularly bacterial infections of the urinary tract. To achieve this goal, I will use the K01 mechanism to meet the following training objectives: Objective 1: Generate innovative data for publication in highly regarded peer-reviewed journals. Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) disproportionately affect women and are common, costly and sometimes life threatening. Escherichia coli is the most frequent causative agent of UTI, and has been shown in mouse models to establish antibiotic-resistant tissue reservoirs that persist long after acute infection of the bladder lumen is resolved. Bacterial emergence from such reservoirs has long been regarded as one likely origin of recurrent infections in humans. We have shown in a novel mouse model that Gardnerella vaginalis, a common member of the urogenital microbiota, causes E. coli to emerge from bladder reservoirs and initiate a recurrent UTI episode. The experiments outlined in this research plan test the hypothesis that G. vaginalis induces UTI recurrence by damaging the bladder epithelium (Aim 1) and modulating the host inflammatory response (Aim 2). These studies will increase our understanding of the mechanisms driving UTI recurrence and have the potential to identify G. vaginalis as a biomarker of risk in susceptible women. Objective 2: Gain expertise in performing translational research. I will engage in training activities, including seminars and didactic coursework offered by the NIH Clinical Center and through the Clinical Research Training Center (CRTC) of the Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS) at Washington University School of Medicine. This instruction will teach me the language and procedures of clinical study design and execution and is essential for me to meet my goal of leading a transdisciplinary team doing T1 clinical research. With guidance from my co-mentors and the Research Design and Biostatistics Group of the ICTS, I will hone my skills in this area by performing a nested case-control study that seeks to confirm the findings of our mouse model in human clinical specimens. Objective 3: Develop my professional abilities and grow my professional network. Washington University has a wealth of career development mechanisms offered through the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning, the Offices of Postgraduate and Faculty Affairs and the CRTC. I will attend seminars and courses on research ethics, scientific manuscript and grant writing, academic job interviewing, laboratory finances and management. Additionally, I will attend instructive seminars at national meetings on urology and infectious diseases, where I will present my research findings and network and build collaborative relationships with leading researchers in the field. I have assembled a mentoring committee that includes leaders in the field of UTI research, which will evaluate the completion of both my scientific and career development milestones and facilitate my transition to an independent investigator."
"9475211","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) Special Study Center on Palliative and End-of-Life Care will be to provide the nephrology community with novel, rigorous and nationally representative information about a domain of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) care for which little information is currently available to guide policy and practice. The median survival of US adults with ESRD is approximately 36 months and far less than this for the growing number of very elderly patients initiating dialysis. Both younger and older patients with ESRD shoulder a significant burden of comorbidity, disability and frailty, while healthcare utilization and costs are exceedingly high. These realitie signal a growing need for a more comprehensive approach to ESRD care that integrates existing disease-based models with a more palliative patient-centered approach intended to relieve suffering and optimize quality of life. National rates of hospice use are extremely low among patients receiving chronic dialysis and rates of invasive interventions during the final month of life are much higher than for patients with other chronic life-limiting conditions, suggesting that there may be a systematic failure to recognize and respond to end-of-life care needs for patients with ESRD. Evidence from single center studies suggest that patients with ESRD have overly optimistic expectations about their prognosis and very low rates of advance care planning; these findings highlight a critically important opportunity to reshape patterns of end-of-life care to better align with patient values, goals and preferences and to reduce unwanted high intensity care at the end of life. There have been no national studies of palliative and end-of-life care in patients with ESRD. Single center studies have been largely cross-sectional, and thus have not examined factors that shape downstream patterns of end-of-life care. To address these knowledge gaps we propose an integrated research agenda to address the following specific aims: 1) to evaluate the palliative care needs, quality of communication about end-of-life care, prognostic expectations, and readiness to engage in advance care planning among a nationally representative sample of ESRD patients; 2) to evaluate the end-of-life experience of a representative national sample of US adults with ESRD and their families; and 3) to assess the relationship between advance directives and palliative care consultations with downstream healthcare utilization and costs in patients with ESRD. We will conduct prospective observational studies among national cohorts of ESRD patients and their family members and complementary secondary analyses of existing USRDS data sources to accomplish these aims. Collectively, we anticipate that the work proposed here will help to identify novel opportunities for improvement and future intervention to enhance the quality of palliative and end-of-life care in patients with ESRD and will serve as an enduring resource for the renal community to support ongoing work in this area."

"9538890","Project Summary Less than half of COPD patients receive the care recommended by practice guidelines. In an era of accountable care organizations and value-based purchasing, there has been increased focus on the patient and system level factors that contribute to the delivery of high quality care and outcomes of patients with chronic conditions such as COPD. With this increased focus has come a recognition that the ?complexity? of both patients and health care systems likely contribute to failures in healthcare delivery, but the extent to which this occurs is not known. Patients with COPD are often described as complex, which has historically been equated to having multiple comorbidities. Recently, there is increased recognition that complexity goes beyond medical comorbidities and includes many social determinants of health that impact patient outcomes. This patient complexity can affect behaviors such as adherence to medications, and the ability to navigate a healthcare system that is also becoming increasingly complex. As patients and systems become more complex, the number of opportunities for failures in healthcare delivery likely increases. Targeting better organization of the structure and processes behind high-quality healthcare delivery may improve outcomes for patients with COPD. To date, it is unknown how patient and health system complexity affects care quality in the management of COPD, but may help explain the larger gaps in care delivery and treatment relative to other common chronic illnesses, such as heart failure. The overarching goal of this training proposal is to examine how patient and health system complexity affects quality of care and medication adherence for patients with COPD. We hypothesize that as both patient and health system complexity increases the delivery of high quality care and adherence decrease. If our hypotheses are true, the results of this study may provide a basis to develop systems to facilitate care services and improve the quality of care delivered to complex patients with COPD."
"9657402","Abstract ? Overall Lung Cancer (LC) has been the most common cancer since 1985, resulting in over 1.8 million deaths worldwide per year. LC survival is dismal with a 5 year mortality of about 90%, largely because of its usual late stage diagnosis. Low dose CT (LDCT) reduces overall and lung cancer specific mortality among highly exposes smokers but yields excess positive findings and currently fails to identify many cases. This program project pursues a comprehensive and complementary set of research agendas to understand predictors of smoking and lung cancer. By integrating a comprehensive set of studies in the domains of smoking, genomics and biomarkers in the ILCCO, TRICL and LC3 consortia, and evaluating them together in the context of NLST and 5 other lung cancer screening trials, substantial progress can be made in early detection of lung cancer. Project 1: Genomic Predictors of Smoking Lung Cancer Risk studies large samples to identify uncommon variants, variants with low risk, and variants that affect risk through gene-environment interactions or through perturbations of pathways and further uses this information for studying environmental exposures. Project 2: Biomarkers of Lung Cancer Risk evaluates a wide range of risk biomarkers that have been implicated as promising lung cancer risk biomarkers, including miRNAs, metabolic, immune, protein, and epigenetic markers, using pre-diagnostic biospecimen from the Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium (LC3), and will identify a panel of validated risk biomarkers for use in risk prediction models Project 3: Translating Molecular and Clinical Data to Population Lung Cancer Risk Assessment establishes an integrated risk prediction model-based on lung cancer CT screening populations in US, Canada and Europe, combining personal health and exposure history, targeted molecular and genomic profiles and lung function data, and establishes comprehensive nodule assessment models for individuals with LDCT-detected non-calcified pulmonary nodules based on both diameter-based and volume-based probability models . These research studies are supported by integrating Administrative and Biostatistics cores. Efficiency is created from the scientific synergies among the projects and the use of shared samples and data. We believe that this level of integration across the P01 with three complementary projects working towards a unifying goal will yield novel observations about lung cancer development and provide unique translational opportunities to refine screening eligibility criteria and ultimately help improve screening efficiency and further reduce lung cancer mortality."
"9398300","Background ? Military Sexual Trauma (MST) among women Veterans is a problem of epidemic proportion associated with significant mental health and functional impairment and substantial access to care barriers. Surveillance data indicate that one in four women Veterans reports MST when screened. Compared to women Veterans with other service-related stressors, those experiencing MST have greater mental health problems, are more likely to report difficulty in functioning in social, family and intimate relationships and are more likely to be unemployed and to report difficulties in finding a job. Nevertheless, women with MST engage less frequently in VA health care than other women Veterans. Barriers to care include distance from specialty services, financial difficulties, childcare and family responsibilities, and gender-related discomfort in male- dominated VA facilities. Research over the past decade has identified the problems and concerns of women Veterans with MST but programs addressing their mental health needs and responsive to identified barriers are lacking. The proposed study addresses this gap by evaluating a gender-sensitive, evidence-based skills training program delivered via home-based video technology. Specific Aims ? The study will conduct a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study to accomplish two aims. The first is to determine the effectiveness of the HBVT-delivered, Skills Training in Affective Regulation (STAIR) relative to a HBVT-delivered nonspecific active comparator, Present Centered Therapy (PCT) among women Veterans with MST. It is hypothesized that STAIR will be superior to PCT in regards to improvement in CAPS PTSD symptoms (primary outcome) as well as in perceived social support and social engagement (secondary outcomes). The second aim is to conduct a multi-stakeholder, mixed method evaluation to inform future potential implementation plans by identify barriers and facilitators of implementing STAIR via HBVT and to contextualize and interpret the quantitative data on treatment processes and clinical effectiveness. Methodology ? This is a four-year, two-site Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study design. A total of 200 women Veterans with MST and PTSD symptoms (with DSM-5 PTSD Screen cut-off > 3) will be enrolled into the study. Participants will be stratified by rurality status in a proportion representative of the national population (34% rural vs. 66% nonrural). Stratification will ensure that resources are dedicated to recruit the identified number of rural women. Within each level of stratification, participants will be randomized into one of two treatments conditions, STAIR or PCT, each of which is comprised of 10 weekly sessions. Assessments will be conducted at five time-points: baseline (week 0), midtreatment (week 5), immediately posttreatment (week 10), 2-month follow-up (week 18) and 4-month follow-up (week 26). Rurality will be included as a covariate and assessed for variations in aspects such as retention and outcome, which will help inform future implementation plans. Multi-stakeholder mixed-method process evaluation concerning STAIR and the use of in-home delivery of services will include administrator, clinician and patient stakeholders. Expected Results and Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Healthcare ? It is expected that the proposed study has the potential to improve the quality of VA healthcare by establishing the effectiveness of a social skills intervention, Skills Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation (STAIR) delivered via home-based video technology (HBVT) to women Veterans with MST, particularly those living in rural areas. The treatment simultaneously addresses social concerns and PTSD symptoms, both of which are identified needs of women Veterans who have experienced MST. STAIR has been demonstrated as efficacious in community populations and pilot data with women Veterans with MST indicate similar outcomes regarding improvements in perceived social support, social engagement and PTSD symptoms. The use of HBVT has the potential of increasing access to care to this geographically dispersed and underserved population."

"9458739","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will determine whether key characteristics of the newly discovered female urinary microbiome, the bacterial community living in the bladder of many adult women, associate strongly with two common forms of urinary incontinence (stress urinary incontinence [SUI] and urgency urinary incontinence [UUI]). To perform this study, Loyola investigators will recruit approximately 1200 women (400 each from two, well- characterized urinary incontinence cohorts and 400 continent controls). They will determine whether certain bacterial species, or entire microbiomes, are related to urinary incontinence symptoms. A significant difference between these clinical subgroups would suggest a relationship between urinary incontinence and the female urinary microbiome (FUM). One FUM member with antibacterial properties will be studied. Our team has diverse expertise including clinicians specializing in urinary incontinence care, and scientists specializing in microbiology and bioinformatics."
"9630928","DESCRIPTION: The goal of this BD2K K01 application is to provide Dr. Jeremy W. Prokop with the mentoring and training to be an independent investigator in big data to knowledge. Mentoring and training will be provided to Dr. Prokop in genomics, proteomics, computer science, and statistics to advance his skill to allow for independence. This will allow for further develop of his sequence-to-structure-to-function analysis for interpretation of protein coding genetic variants into a usable workflow available to other scientists. The mentoring throughout this award will be from Dr. Howard Jacob, a leader in rat/human genetics and tool development to understand variants in whole genomes. Additionally, Dr. Andrew Greene serves as a co-mentor to help advance skills in proteomics and Dr. Christina Kendziorski as a co-mentor to advance statistical tools/approaches. The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) is a leader in the use of whole genome sequencing in understanding human health, with a Cap/CLIA certified clinical sequencing facility, tools for identifying genetic variants from whole genomes (such as Carpe Novo), and operation of databases like the Rat Genome Database. These tools and knowledge at MCW will serve as an asset for the training and completion of the Aims in this award. Dr. Prokop's research focus in this grant is to further expand the sequence-to-structure-to-function approaches he developed during his Ph.D. and initial postdoc into a workflow and web submission server for other users. Aim 1 of the grant organizes these steps into a workflow allowing for the development of the web based submission server. To test the workflow, 75 candidate genes for cardiovascular disease will be screened. Initial use of the approach has revealed hypotheses for how genetic variants in Havcr1 and Shroom3 result in altered cardiovascular drug response or disease. Variants in these two proteins will be biochemically characterized using a novel decision tree to standardize experiments (Aim 2) and to serve as a quality control for the approaches of Aim 1. From the results of the 75 screened cardiovascular genes, the four genes with the highest confidence score will be validated using the biochemical decision tree in year four and five of this award serving as an additional quality control for the approaches in Aim 1. This grant will provide the training and support for Dr. Prokop to be integrated into the Medical College of Wisconsin's Clinical Sequencing program, allowing for additional R01 proposals for validation of genetic causes of disease, and facilitate the development of Dr. Prokop into an independent researcher in the use of big data."
"9548071","Abstract:  Tanzania has an estimated HIV seroprevalence of 4.7%, and 1,400,000 persons living with HIV infection. It faces significant obstacles to optimal care and prevention services including a lack of HIV-related knowledge, co-morbidities of mental illness and substance abuse, poverty, rural residence, limited health care infrastructure, and inadequate numbers of health care personnel. Tanzanian leadership and the PEPFAR Country Operating Plan have prioritized the uptake of testing services, optimizing adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), promoting diligent monitoring of ART with viral load testing, and addressing co-morbidities of mental illness and substance abuse. In this context, the importance of developing in-country research expertise in sociobehavioral and implementation sciences is extraordinary.  The Duke University Global Health Institute (DGHI) and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC)/Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College (KCMU Co) have partnered to develop such expertise. They have a robust portfolio of research supported by six different NIH Institutes. Development of research expertise has been a priority, and has been supported by four D43 awards and the Medical Education Partnership Initiative. In our current D43 funding cycle, the HIV and Sociobehavioral Sciences Research Training Program has supported the trainings of three PhD's, one Master's of Medicine (MMed) in Psychiatry, three Master's in Public Health, and three short-term trainees to build research capacity. Many of these trainings have occurred in a South-South relationship between the University of Cape Town (UCT) and KCMC/KCMU Co.  In this competitive renewal application, we propose trainings to further expand and solidify these initial efforts. Candidates will pursue PhD trainings in implementation science (University of North Carolina) and Psychology at (UCT), MMed in Psychiatry (UCT), MPH (UCT), and short-term trainings. Upon completion, these scientists will join those from the current D43 training cycle to form a talented team with a breadth of expertise to perform rigorous sociobehavioral and implementation science research. Together they will have access to a limited pool of pilot research funds through this proposal to further their pathway to independence. They will receive strong institutional support from the research environment and culture of KCMC/KCMU College, who have also agreed to create Departments of Sociobehavioral Sciences and Sociobehavioral Medicine to host the scientists upon return to Moshi."
"9457477","Project Summary/ Abstract  Bioassay-guided fractionation of cells often uncovers small molecules that bind macromolecular targets in new and unexpected ways. Exploration of the chemical reactivity and target selectivity of these metabolites has laid the chemical foundation for the development of new biological tools and therapeutics. The molecular architecture of secondary metabolites is challenging and different than the chemical space explored by most medicinal chemistry campaigns: there is recognized `natural product-like' space and we lack the tools to explore it with the same depth as `drug-like' space. Our lab has developed new tools to more easily access natural products, and has focused our efforts on secondary metabolite families that appear to covalently modify their targets as the basis for their phenotypic effects. Our chemical syntheses are deliberately concise and easily-scaled to enable subsequent investigation into reactivity and biological activity. The current application significantly advances these efforts, provides compelling preliminary data as a foundation for the proposed work, and delves into new areas of chemistry.  In this proposal, two areas of research are described: 1. the identification and investigation of covalently-reactive pharmacophores associated with the asmarine alkaloids, Nuphar dimers and isocyanoterpenes; and 2. the development of cross-coupling technology to access `natural product-space' more generally. In the first area, we disclose a preliminary cellular target of the unusual N-hydroxydiazepine purine (HAP) pharmacophore of the asmarine alkaloids and address unsolved problems posed by this motif. As part of a theme that runs throughout our work, we show how the aims of chemistry and biology intersect in the study of covalently reactive secondary metabolites. We also investigate the sulfur-electrophilicity of the Nuphar dimers, a property recently demonstrated by our lab to operate in organic solvent and cellular environments. We propose solutions to the challenging stereochemical problems posed by the monohydroxy dimers and show how chemistry developed in our lab can generate a combinatorial library of sulfur electrophiles. In a third area, we investigate the challenging architecture and reactivity of the isocyanoterpenes, which we recently demonstrated can kill Plasmodia by an alternative mechanism to the heme detoxification pathway often suggested. We also propose a novel caging strategy to render the isonitriles systemically-viable. In part two, we investigate a bimetallic catalytic cycle capable of solving long-standing problems in chemical synthesis. The proposed methodology is supported by proof-of-principle examples and provides chemists the reaction vehicles necessary to `escape from flatland.'"
"9461622","SUMMARY: PROJECT 4 Despite genetic and epidemiological data implicating maternal exposures and neuroimmune mechanisms as a risk factor for schizophrenia (SZ) and the development of maternal immune activation (MIA) animal models of altered neurodevelopment, little is known about the specific mechanisms by which MIA leads to altered brain development, connectivity and behavior. Project 4 will address this critical gap in our knowledge by pursuing two Specific Aims related to the role of neural inflammation in MIA and SZ. Informed by our preliminary studies that found evidence of cortical inflammation and increased striatal pre-synaptic dopamine (DA) in MIA nonhuman primates (NHPs), Aim 1 will use Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a new cohort of MIA NHPs to investigate the developmental course of inflammation and increased striatal DA, and their relationship to abnormal social interactions and cognition in these animals. Further, this aim will test a neurodevelopmental model in which cortical inflammation measured using [18F]PBR 111 PET during childhood precedes the development of increased subcortical DA measured using [18F] fluoromethyltyrosine (FMT) PET and worsening atypical behaviors after puberty. Aim 2 will investigate the clinical significance of the MIA model by using MRI-based measures of neuroinflammation (diffusion-based measurement of free water, glutathione spectroscopy) that will be also obtained longitudinally in the NHP's as well as in patients with first-episode SZ. Successful completion of this study will provide new insights into the developmental neurobiology of brain inflammation in the MIA NHP and the relationship between inflammation, excessive subcortical DA, and changes in social behaviors and cognition in these animals. Direct comparison of the NHP model and humans with first-episode SZ on MRI markers of brain inflammation will provide an important test of the clinical significance of the MIA model."
"9458093","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The treatment of open fractures often requires grafting in order for union to occur. Despite meticulous surgical care and antibiotic administration, small amounts of bacteria often survive within a biofilm in the bone defect. When the fracture is grafted, the avascular bone graft provides the residual bacteria with an ideal environment to thrive, which increases the likelihood of infection. Injectable, settable lysine-derived polyurethane composite bone grafts augmented with a biofilm dispersal agent can overcome both the biological challenges for healing and the microbiological challenges associated with infection. Release of a biofilm dispersal agent for an extended period of time is anticipated to protect the graft from bacterial colonization and subsequent infection. Recently, naturally occurring biofilm dispersal agents, such as D-amino acids, have been discovered that both prevent bacteria from forming a biofilm and also signal bacteria that are in a biofilm to disperse. Bacteria released from the biofilm revert to the antibiotic-susceptible planktonic phenotype, thereby potentiating the effects of systemic antibiotics. We hypothesize that injectable, settable biofilm-dispersive bone grafts will allow healing to occur in contaminated open fractures, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing rates of complications, including infection and non-union."
"9462025","ABSTRACT Lysosomes, the essential organelle for cellular waste and pathogen clearance through all autophagic and endocytic pathways, are highly vulnerable in aging neurons and strongly implicated in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis, particularly Alzheimer?s Disease (AD). We showed that presenilin 1 (PS1) is required for vATPase activity necessary to acidify lysosomes and initiate digestion: loss of PS1 function in familial AD impedes substrate degradation, leading to neuronal dysfunction and AD-related pathology. Recently, we reported that the direct molecular trigger of the endosomal dysfunction linked to cholinergic neurodegeneration in AD is the APP ?-site cleaved C-terminal fragment (?CTF) (studied in Projects 1, 3, and 4). Our newest data indicate a significant impact of ?CTF on lysosome function, including impaired acidification. Our working hypothesis is that other risk factors, including ones for late-onset AD (ApoE4, cholesterol, brain aging), impair lysosomal function by ?CTF-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Much of this lysosomal dysfunction stems from the compromise of vATPase, occuring via multiple mechanisms shown to disrupt its function and thereby raise lysosomal pH and promote neurodegeneration. In 3 specific aims, we address both the mechanisms underlying pathogenic lysosomal dysfunction in AD and strategies to remediate this dysfunction. In Aim 1, we will define the molecular basis for lysosomal dysfunction in a late-onset AD model of wild-type APP overexpression and a Down syndrome model with known ?CTF-driven endosome phenotypes in comparison to models in which lysosome compromise is induced by known AD risk factors (ApoE4 genotype and dietary fat/cholesterol). Models in which ?CTF are also experimentally modulated will be used to ascertain the nature and extent of the ?CTF contributions, believed to be major, in compromising lysosomal pH regulation, substrate hydrolysis, and signaling functions. A novel role of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in ?CTF metabolism will be assessed in relation to known aging-related declines in the efficiency of CMA and lysosomes. In Aim 2, we will define in neurons and isolated lysosomes multiple suspected mechanisms underlying the loss of vATPase function seen in AD models. In Aim 3, we will characterize a novel lysosomal pH modulation mechanism via the ClC7 chloride channel and the basis for its ability to reverse acidification deficits and fully rescue lysosomal and autophagy deficits in PS1 deficient and FAD patient cells. The detailed mechanism by which certain beta-adrenergic agonists induce this rescue, the applicability of this remediation to non-PS AD models, and the evaluation of more optimal brain-penetrant compounds that promote lysosomal acidification are additional goals of Aim 3. Novel genetic models with altered endosomal-lysosomal function or that report on neuronal lysosomal network function in vivo are introduced in our project and serve to enhance expectations that we will make fundamental insights into lysosome biology relevant to AD and its therapy."

"9461118","Abstract Rhinovirus (RV) is the most common cause of asthma exacerbation but underlying mechanisms are not com- pletely known. We have noted colocalization of RV with CD68, a macrophage marker, in the airways of aller- gen-exposed, RV-infected mice as well as human asthmatics experimentally infected with RV. In mice, deple- tion of macrophages decreased RV-induced eosinophilic airway inflammation and responsiveness, suggesting that these cells play a direct role in the response. Further, we found that RV-induced cytokine expression is attenuated in macrophages from TLR2 null mice, showing an unexpected role for TLR2 in the response to RV.  In this proposal, we test the novel hypothesis that insertion of myristoylated viral polypeptide (VP)-4 into the macrophage plasma membrane triggers cytokine production by interacting with a TLR2 signaling complex. We have obtained abundant pilot data to support this hypothesis, including that: 1) TLR2 is required for RV- induced cytokine responses in human macrophages as well as RV1B-infected naïve and allergen-treated mice; 2) transfer of IL-4 treated, wild type macrophages to TLR2 KO mice appears to be sufficient for RV-induced airway eosinophilic inflammation; 3) in macrophages, RV colocalizes with TLR2 and TLR1; and 4) recombinant myristoylated VP4 (MyrVP4) increases cytokine mRNA expression in a TLR2-dependent manner.  Specific Aim 1: Determine the contribution of macrophage TLR2 and its cofactors to RV-induced airway responses. The requirement of TLR2 for RV-induced airway responses in vivo will be tested in naïve and house dust mite-sensitized and -challenged mice using neutralizing antibody against TLR2, TLR2 null mice, bone marrow chimeras and a small molecule TLR2 inhibitor. The sufficiency of TLR2-expressing macro- phages will be determined by adoptive transfer. RV/TLR2 interactions will be examined by confocal microsco- py and co-immunoprecipitation. The role of putative TLR2 cofactors -- TLR1, TLR6 and CD14 -- will be exam- ined by confocal microscopy, coimmunoprecipitation and experiments employing relevant neutralizing antibod- ies and knockout mice. Finally, we will measure expression of miR-146a, a signaling outcome of TLR2 activa- tion, in nasal aspirates of asthmatic children before and during natural colds.  Specific Aim 2: Determine the contribution of myristoylated VP4 to RV-induced airway responses. We will examine the direct effects of recombinant VP4, MyrVP4 and VP4 mutants on mouse and human mac- rophages in vitro and airway responses in vivo. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we will examine interactions between VP4 and TLR2 and identify VP4 residues required for interaction with the TLR2 signaling complex. We will employ an RV1B maturation cleavage mutant to test if MyrVP4 is required for RV- induced cytokine expression in vitro and in vivo. Localization of VP4 and TLR2 in lipid rafts will be examined by confocal microscopy, and the requirement of TLR2 for VP4-mediated effects will be tested.  Completion of this work could provide new therapeutic targets for RV-induced asthma exacerbations."
"9459868","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper function of the inner ear requires the presence of mechanoreceptive hair cells, which convert sound vibrations and head movements into electrical signals that are conveyed to the brain. Hair cells can be injured or lost as a result of noise exposure, ototoxic medications, inner ear infections, or as part of normal aging. The human ear cannot replace hair cells, and their loss is a leading cause of sensorineural deafness and balance disorders. It is notable, however, that the ears of nonmammalian vertebrates can quickly regenerate hair cells after injury. A more complete understanding of the cellular basis of this regenerative process is likely to suggest methods for inducing similar forms of regeneration in the human ear. Most ongoing research on hair cell regeneration is focused on the intrinsic properties of the cells that reside within the sensory epithelium. In contrast, the proposed research will examine how the sensory epithelium is regulated by its supporting (stromal) tissues and by macrophages. Our prior work has shown that macrophages - the primary effector cells of the innate immune system - actively remove the debris of dying hair cells, but the chemical signals that recruit macrophages into the injured ear are completely unknown. A series of studies will evaluate the role of several candidate chemoattractants in the process of macrophage recruitment, and also determine whether macrophages actively contribute to hair cell death after ototoxicity. Knowledge acquired from such work will have applications beyond regenerative medicine. Many inner ear pathologies are thought to involve inflammation, and identifying how the ear regulates innate immunity may lead to more effective therapies for such conditions. A second series of studies will explore how the cells of the stromal tissues influence repair and regeneration within the ear's sensory epithelia. Using newly-acquired genomic data and novel culture techniques, we will determine how cellular signals are transmitted from stroma to epithelium and then identify candidate genes that participate in this process. Additional studies will reveal whether the composition of the stromal tissues limits regeneration in the mammalian ear and also whether signaling from the stroma regulates the population of resident stem cells. Together, the outcomes of these studies will generate knowledge essential for the development of methods for `rebuilding' the sensory structures of the inner ear after damage or age-related pathologies."
"9429033","Abstract. The huge burden of communicable diseases on the African continent is largely made up of HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The trio of diseases alone is creating societal and economic instability in most African countries across all age groups, and particularly in children. Most recent UNAIDS estimates of the global burden of HIV are that 36.9 million people are currently living with HIV-1 infection and 25.8 million of them reside in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The implementation of anti- retroviral therapy of HIV-1 infected people, which are necessary short-term solutions, comes with complications of costs and iatrogenic effects of drugs, and is not a long-term solution to stop the epidemic in SSA. HIV prevention remains critical to turn the tide of HIV infections and an effective vaccine against HIV-1 is desperately needed. The ability of HIV-1 to escape immune responses represents a complex and challenging hurdle that needs to be resolved so that a protective vaccine regimen can be developed. Similarly, continuous efforts are required to develop vaccines that would mitigate HIV-1 co-morbidities of TB and malaria. In 2015, the Office of AIDS Research announced priority areas of investigations into reducing the incidence of HIV, including the development of safe and effective HIV vaccines and research training of the workforce (NOT-OD-15-137; http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-137.html). In this application, we propose to train young scientists in Africa to fill the gap in ongoing efforts to build scientific literacy on the continent and to enhance the ability to perform immunology research. As the NIH is sponsoring several basic research projects as well as clinical vaccine trials in Africa, we believe that the proposed Infectious Disease in Africa symposia will lead to increased scientific knowledge and will help build future scientific leaders on the Continent.  On the back of two rounds of 3-year funding (and 6 IDA symposia), we now propose a further set of symposia, where the overarching aims are: 1) to provide cutting-edge knowledge in the fields of HIV vaccine development and related aspects of malaria and TB; and 2) to foster scientific leadership on the African Continent.  We are proposing a set of three IDA symposia that will take place in Cape Town, South Africa and we will focus on specific topics for each meeting. In the first IDA symposium, we will focus on mechanisms of HIV escape from the immune system and how this represents a major challenge for vaccine development. With our prior experience, we have developed a unique approach of student:teacher mentorship which involves a blend of on-line learning and contact time focused on round-table discussions."
"9541584","As the number of cancer patients with stable disease increases, the long-term cardiotoxic effects of treatment with anti-cancer drugs become increasingly apparent. Cardiovascular-related mortality is 7-fold higher in childhood cancer survivors than expected from an age matched normal population and ~12% of breast cancer survivors suffer heart failure within three years of treatment. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are exemplars of promising anti-cancer drugs whose use is complicated by cardiotoxicity. Whether this reflects drug-mediated inhibition of the same signaling pathways as the anti-oncogenic effects of these drugs is unclear. Cardiotoxic phenotypes induced by chemically diverse TKIs include life-threatening heart failure and cardiac infarction, and are likely to include targets that are not the nominal ones; this is particularly true of poly- selective TKIs. Identifying the precise mechanisms of TKI-mediated cardiotoxicity has the potential to substantially improve cancer care and also reveal fundamental aspects of cardiac cell biology.  My project exploits the recent development of reproducible means to transdifferentiate human induced pluripotent stem cell into cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and probe the biology of these cells using omic and ?systems biology? methods. I have collected extensive preliminary data on hiPSC-CMs responses to over 50 different drug perturbations and am in the midst of using statistical regression and machine learning algorithms to define and study the molecular networks associated with TKI-induced cardiotoxicity. I have already found that cardiac energy metabolism is dysregulated by many cardiotoxic drugs and could be biomarker of cardiotoxicity more broadly. In this proposal, I will build on my profiling data through focused study of Sorafenib, a drug that I have shown to increase anaerobic glycolysis in hiPSC-CMs. As a multi-target drug, Sorafenib inhibits multiple kinases and gene networks. Identifying targets relevant to cardiotoxicity is a key goal of my research. I will tackle this by establishing the sequential onset of molecular networks after drug treatment and their causal relation with the increased glycolysis phenotype. Single cell heterogeneous molecular responses will be analyzed to find non-genetic mechanisms that determine the differential sensitivity of cardiotoxicity to Sorafenib. I will build quantitative models to fit and explain data at population and single cell levels. Ultimately, to find means to increase therapeutic effects, I want to systematically compare target expression, phenotypic responses and molecular mechanisms induced by Sorafenib in both hiPSC-CMs and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (treated by Sorafenib clinically). My study will generate pilot methods in converting ?big data? into mechanistic insights in cardiac biology, and facilitate development of new therapies to mitigate cardiotoxicity without compromising efficacy of cancer elimination."
"9438868","Project Summary  The long range goals of this proposal are to define molecular mechanisms by which mechanical forces experienced by cells influence growth control pathways, and to determine where, when and how these mechanisms are employed in vivo to modulate organ size. They build on the discovery in Drosophila of a biomechanical mechanism for modulating the Hippo pathway, which is a key regulator of growth and cell fate in all animals, including humans. This mechanism is triggered by cytoskeletal tension-dependent recruitment of the Ajuba family LIM protein (Jub) to ?-catenin at adherens junctions. Jub then recruits and inhibits the key Hippo pathway kinase, Warts, which leads to increased activity of Yorkie, a transcription factor of the Hippo pathway.  Our studies will enhance understanding of how cells respond to their mechanical environment, how biomechanical signaling is integrated with biochemical signaling, and how biomechanical signaling modulates growth and cell fate decisions. The first aim proposes studies to identify components of this pathway in mammalian cells and to determine the contribution of this pathway to the regulation of Hippo signaling in different mechanical environments. We also propose to develop methods to visualize the activity of this pathway in live mice. The second aim proposes genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the molecular mechanism by which forces are actually sensed and transmitted to the Ajuba and Warts family proteins. The third aim investigates the relationship between the influence of cytoskeletal tension on Ajuba family proteins, and its influence on ?-catenin, through a combination of biochemical, imaging, and genetic approaches, and will employ both Drosophila and cultured cell models.  These studies investigate fundamental processes that cells use to respond to their mechanical environment. The results of these studies will be relevant to understanding both normal development and physiology, and to disease states associated with either insufficient or excess growth. As inappropriate growth during development results in organs that are incorrectly sized or shaped, it can cause birth defects. Controlling organ growth is also important for understanding how stem cells can be used to repair or replace damaged organs, which is a goal of regenerative medicine. Additionally, the inability to limit growth in mature organisms results in cancer. Cancers in a wide variety of organs have been associated with inactivation of Hippo signaling, including liver, kidney, skin, brain, intestine, lung, ovary, breast, and prostate. Understanding the regulation of Hippo signaling is thus relevant to a range of human health issues, including birth defects, cancer, and regenerative medicine."

"9509410","Transgenic Mouse/Embryonic Stem Cell Shared Resource: Project Summary/Abstract For the past 22 years, the Transgenic Mouse/Embryonic Stem Cell Shared Resource (TMESCSR) has provided a cornerstone for many scientific advances within the Vanderbilt Diabetes Research and Training Center (VDRTC), and elsewhere. Not only have the TMESCSR-derived mice enabled hundreds of highly impactful studies to be performed by VDRTC investigators, they have also been utilized by numerous other non-VDRTC investigators who obtain these animals from public repositories. With the discovery of CRISPR/Cas, which enables the derivation of mice with precisely targeted mutations in a rapid and efficient manner, the TMESCSR made the strategic decision to discontinue its long-standing mouse ES cell (mESC)- based gene targeting service. This action enabled the personnel supporting this resource to optimize and deliver a new CRISPR/Cas-based service, while continuing to provide many other frequently utilized mouse- based services. Together, the services provided by the TMESCSR enable VDRTC members to efficiently derive mice with new genetic alterations, to maintain and cryopreserve existing mouse lines, and to derive new lines from the vast number of mutant mESCs and frozen embryos or sperm that are now available from several large-scale mutagenesis projects, including the Knock-out Mouse Project (KOMP). VDRTC support enables the TMESCSR to import and optimize new technology, such as CRISPR/Cas, thereby assuring that VDRTC investigators have continuing access to up-to-date strategies for deriving state-of-the-art mouse models. These mouse models, in turn, enable VDRTC members to perform high quality studies to understand the pathogenesis of diabetes, obesity and other endocrine diseases, and to perform preclinical testing of new therapies for these diseases, utilizing the expertise in other VDRTC-supported cores (e.g. Cell Imaging Shared Resource, Metabolic Physiology Shared Resource, Hormone Assay and Analytical Services Core)."

The RC3 is a key cog in the interaction among scientists from diverse disciplines to accomplish this mission. It provides research-design and statistical-analysis resources and helps construct data-collection forms and manage the data (including providing quality control) for both preclinical and clinical studies conducted within the OAIC. The RC3 is involved in all phases of the OAIC studies: initial pre-proposal study design and sample-size calculations, randomization, and state-of-the-art statistical analyses once the data are collected. It also helps prepare manuscripts for dissemination within the research community. In addition, the RC3 serves as a key resource to OAIC junior faculty and Junior Scholars, providing consulting services and periodic special-interest training topics, such as research design, power analysis, data management, study implementation and management, and statistical methodology and analyses. Finally, for OAIC studies where the existing biostatistical methodologies are inadequate, the RC3 has assembled strong expertise for developing new biostatistical methods and data-management tools beyond current practice. The RC3 will develop new methodology for adaptive design of clinical trials and simultaneous statistical inference. This will provide customized support that meets the demands of the OAIC's research design and statistical analyses."

"9472874","Core B: Tissue, Peptide and Genetics Resource Core  This program project is broadly focused on understanding the mechanisms by which inflammation modulates  AD pathogenesis. An additional theme of this project is focused on how proteins recently identified by  Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in Alzheimer disease (AD) modulate the infiammatory cascade,  contribute to endocytic dysfunction, and impair protein trafficking/clearance, and thereby increase AD risk.  An overarching goal of the program project is to utilize molecular, cellular and animal model systems to  identify and characterize mechanisms and pathways associated AD neuropathology (e.g. Aß, tau,  inflammation, and synaptic and neuronal loss) and neuroinflammation. The outcome of these studies can be  translated and verifled in human autopsy brain specimens. The Tissue, Peptide, and Genetics Core plays a  key role in support of the program project research goals. To achieve these goals, the Tissue, Peptide and  Genetics Core has four aims. (1) Produce and provide well-characterized, high quality peptides, antibodies,  and Aß assays to individual investigators. All program investigators require either Aß peptides, preparations  of different types of Aß assembly states, or both soluble and insoluble Aß measurements. (2) Carry out high-  throughput analysis for newly identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk alleles for late-onset AD  to support investigator research. Individual investigators will require SNP data from living subjects, from  induced pluripotent stem cells derived from fibroblasts, as well as from brain autopsy specimens. (3) The  Tissue, Peptide, and Genetics Core will support program project research by providing dedicated high quality  clinically and neuropathologically characterized human autopsy and biological specimens (blood, fibroblasts)  for use by program project investigators (including SNP data from GWAS-identified AD-risk genes).

"9462024","ABSTRACT Neuronal early endosome pathology is among the earliest disease-specific features of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and has been mechanistically linked to elevated levels of -site cleaved carboxyl-terminal fragment ( CTF) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Pathological features of the AD early endosome phenotype include rab5 hyperactivation, downstream disruption of the endosomal-lysosomal (EL) pathway, and a failure of endosome-mediated trophic support. Our preliminary findings show that expression of the ApoE4 allele, the greatest genetic-risk factor for AD, leads to alterations in neuronal early endosomes in ApoE4 mice (Core B). Given that alterations in cholesterol metabolism in the brain have been suggested to play a role in AD and that we find increased CTF levels in the brain with ApoE4 expression, we will test the hypothesis that ApoE4 drives CTF and cholesterol alterations that interact to promote endosomal dysfunction and downstream lysosomal network (LN) pathology ((Project 2 (P2), P3 and P4). We will examine the lipidome and proteome of brain endosomal fractions, isolated from ApoE4 expressing mice and humans (Core C) in order to identify the molecular mechanism driving ApoE4 EL pathway alterations and neuronal vulnerability. We will use direct manipulation of cholesterol in vitro and dietary challenge in vivo and manipulation of CTF levels by BACE1 downregulation to test the hypothesis that synergy between these molecules contributes to the pathological ApoE4-driven LN phenotype. At-risk neuronal populations will be identified and examined using gene expression analysis (P4) to elucidate the molecular mechanism of LN vulnerability. Behavioral assays will be used to demonstrate cognitive consequences (Core C). Given the importance of endosome-to-Golgi recycling as an exit pathway from early endosome and the recent recognition that retromer dysfunction may contribute to AD pathobiology, we have undertaken preliminary studies to determine whether manipulation of the CTF can rescue early endosomal pathology by stimulating the retromer pathway. We found that binding antibodies specifically to the CTF in living cells can increase retromer-containing vesicles while reducing early endosomal pathology. We will test the novel hypothesis that promoting CTF trafficking though the endosome- to-Golgi recycling pathway reduces pathogenic CTF endosome-signaling and rescues pathological changes in early endosomes and the neurodegenerative cascade this initiates. This proposal examines multiple trafficking routes from the early endosome as well as the consequences of early endosomal dysfunction, including impaired endosome-mediated trophic support, and, in collaboration with all of the other Projects, downstream pathological LN changes. This represents a conceptually innovative approach to AD risk and pathology while exploring novel molecular mechanisms ? including CTF trafficking and signaling, the role of cholesterol in CTF function, and interacting trafficking signals and cascades at the early endosome and retromer ? that drive this pathology."

"9478394","ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is a priority disease for the World Health Organization (WHO), and the emergence of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates poses an enormous threat to TB intervention efforts. South Africa has a rich history of medicinal plant use for treatment of respiratory ailments and infections, as well as HIV. Amongst the traditional and complementary medicines (T/CAM), Sutherlandia frutescens (SF) is commonly used to alleviate respiratory and HIV-associated conditions/ailments. Recent analysis of an NIH-sponsored clinical trial of the safety of SF consumption by HIV+ individuals suggests that SF may reduce the bactericidal effects of first-line isoniazid (INH) therapy for TB, which could contribute to TB transmission and the emergence of multidrug- resistant (MDR) Mtb bacilli. The revision application submitted here will explore the potential for SF to hinder INH bactericidal efficacy. Specifically, it will investigate the capacity of SF to inhibit intracellular effector molecules, including nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, and to alter the mycobacterial SOS response. In addition, it will address the potential for SF to block INH killing of Mtb in culture and to block INH killing of Mtb in an aerosol infection humanized mouse model. Outcomes will focus on SF-dependent effects on INH efficacy and comparative organ pathology during treatment. Consistent with the research aims of the parent grant (U01HD085531), the study will apply a combination of mycobacterial reporter mutants and advanced florescence microscopy to investigate the role of SOS- dependent mutagenesis in Mtb exposed to INH and SF as a key molecular mechanism driving the emergence of MDR-TB. In summary, the project aims to address a long-standing question among practicing South African and international infectious disease clinicians and health policy makers around the impact of T/CAMs on the efficacy of frontline anti-TB chemotherapy. To this end, it combines a strong scientific rationale with a collaborative team comprising South African and U.S. researchers with the necessary expertise. As such, the project responds directly to the FOA in ensuring support for relevant scientific research led by SA investigators from underrepresented backgrounds, and conducted at research facilities in South Africa which are proximal to the disease."
"9548349","Abstract The proposed project will strengthen research infrastructure in low and middle income countries by working with the Addis Ababa University (AAU) in Ethiopia to strengthen its Institutional Review Board (IRB). Specifically, we will enhance the ethical review quality and administrative efficiency of the AAU College of Health Sciences IRB (AAU-CHS-IRB). This work is closely collaborative with the AAU School of Public Health, building upon existing partnerships between AAU and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), including multiple existing HIV/AIDS and other biomedical research and training collaborations amongst faculty at JHU and AAU, all of whom are eager to support increased capacity of the AAU-CHS-IRB. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) strengthen ethics knowledge and applied ethical reasoning for members of AAU-CHS-IRB, 2) strengthen ethics knowledge and applied ethical reasoning for AAU-CHS-IRB office staff, 3) improve the administrative efficiency and accountability of AAU-CHS-IRB systems and operations, and 4) evaluate needs and changes in knowledge, skills, and efficiency of AAU-CHS-IRB members, staff and the committee as a whole using an ethics knowledge tool and a novel Research Ethics Committee Assessment Tool. While ethics review of human subject research is always important, HIV research often raises particularly complex or challenging ethical issues involving respect for and protection of vulnerable and marginalized populations, fair benefits to participants, and appropriate standards of care. The proposed program will therefore support the ethical conduct of HIV/AIDS research in all areas of high national and global priority, including research to reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS, develop next generation therapies, and reduce health disparities. High functioning IRB members and staff are critical components of the HIV/AIDS research workforce. Our three year training program will include having selected individuals participate in an intensive, one-month focused research ethics training program at JHU, on-site technical consultations from a JHU IRB expert and two African bioethics experts (both Fogarty alumni), ethics seminars led by local ethics experts, monthly support telephone calls with JHU and African IRB consultants, and a webinar series on meeting practical challenges of IRB operations. These activities will provide rigorous, on-going strategies to strengthen the quality of ethics review by AAU- CHS-IRB and its administrative efficiency, building both on JHU's expertise in research ethics and ethics review and leveraging the expertise of two African colleagues well versed in high quality IRB operations. We will measure AAU-CHS-IRB members' ethics knowledge before and after the program using an original tool, and we will document various administrative efficiency measures such as time to review completion. We also will implement an original needs assessment tool that more broadly measures committee strengths and needs/gaps to tailor training to what is needed. We expect AAU-CHS-IRB ultimately to be a model and resource for other IRBs in Africa and for researchers facing ethics challenges in their HIV and other studies."
"9463463","Career Development Core (CDC) Abstract The CDC is an integral part of the Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET). The University of Pennsylvania does not have a School of Public Health or a Department of Environmental Health Sciences (EHS). Thus, the CDC is the entity within CEET charged with establishing EHS Training at Penn where none existed before. A major accomplishment in the last funding period was to inaugurate a Certificate Program in EHS, obtain funding for an institutional training grant (T32-Translational Research Training Program in EHS), the establishment of trans-disciplinary training program in environmental science and environmental health sciences to support a newly Superfund Research Program, and introduction of EHS training to fourth year medical students. The mission of the Career Development Core (CDC) is to provide career training for the next generation of environmental health scientists within the broadest context, to develop the career of rising Young Investigators so that they can become independent scientists, and to attract new investigators into the discipline. The CDC is co-led by Rebecca Simmons MD and George Gerton PhD who are experienced in training both clinicians and basic scientists, respectively. The CDC is mindful that clinician scientists are rarely attracted into EHS. The specific aims of this core are to: (i) develop a stand-alone graduate group in EHS so that a PhD degree can be offered in the discipline; (ii) introduce EHS training throughout the four-years of the medical school curriculum; (iii) maintain a Young Investigator data-base (senior postdoctoral fellows, Research Associates, and new Assistant Professors) to monitor their career path); (iv) use a mentoring committee to provide career development; (v) identify Young Investigators to a apply for a CEET Mentored Scientist Transition Award so that they can gain independence; and (vi) provide training for clinician scientists in EHS."
"9443693","ABSTRACT The human genome produces many thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) ? transcripts >200 nucleotides long with little evidence of protein coding potential. It is now clear that lncRNAs can have critical biological functions and roles in human disease including cancer. Because lncRNAs are particularly cell and disease specific, they are attractive as therapeutic targets. However, our understanding of lncRNAs in primary brain tumors is still very limited. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor. Despite surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatment, the median survival after diagnosis of GBM is only 14-16 months. Our long-term goal is to develop highly specific and effective new therapies for the treatment of primary brain tumors including GBM. In pursuit of this goal, our immediate objective is to identify and pursue specific lncRNAs as therapeutic targets in human gliomas. CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) is a readily scalable and highly specific technology for transcriptional regulation, and we have recently implemented this as a method for lncRNA knockdown in human GBM cells. In Preliminary Studies, we have developed CRISPRi for large-scale, genome-wide screening of lncRNA function in human brain tumor cells. In our pilot screen of ~1300 GBM-expressed lncRNAs, we identified 27 that regulate the propagation of GBM cells in culture. CRISPRi screen ?hits? could be individually validated with both CRISPRi and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) mediated knockdown. Knockdown of one particular lncRNA ? LINC00909 ? strongly reduced glioma cell propagation in culture and in a xenograft mouse model. LINC00909 overexpression is very specific to GBM tumors, and higher LINC00909 expression predicts shorter survival of patients with mesenchymal GBM. Interestingly, in the developing human brain, LINC00909 was enriched in normal neural stem cells, and expression analysis suggests LINC00909 expression in GBM cancer stem cells (CSCs). Given these Preliminary Studies, our central hypothesis is that specific lncRNAs such as LINC00909 are uniquely required for GBM tumor growth but not the viability of normal adult human brain cells. In this proposal, our first Aim is to determine the role of LINC00909 in models of human GBM both in vitro and in vivo. Whether LINC00909 has essential function in normal glia and neurons will also be tested. For our second Aim, we will use CRISPRi to more comprehensively identify lncRNAs that regulate GBM tumor growth. In addition to further testing our central hypothesis, this work will provide an important data resource (lncRNA hit identification) and novel tools (large-scale CRISPRi screening libraries and methods) ? both of which we will make available for distribution. In addition to our expertise with lncRNAs and Preliminary Studies, our ongoing local collaborations with Dr. Jonathan Weissman (CRISPRi), Dr. Aaron Diaz (bioinformatics) and Dr. Nalin Gupta (primary human brain tumor models) support the feasibility of this work. By accomplishing these studies, we will lay novel, important groundwork for the development of lncRNAs as targets for glioma therapy."
"9469538","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NIH Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) proposal describes a five- year training program for career development in academic pulmonary medicine. The principal investigator, William Oldham, M.D., Ph.D., is an Associate Physician and Instructor of Medicine in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School. He has a background in chemistry and biochemistry and completed doctoral research in pharmacology while a member of the NIH Medical Scientist Training Program at Vanderbilt University. He completed clinical training in Internal Medicine, Pulmonary Disease, and Critical Care Medicine in 2012. His goal is to develop a successful career as an independently funded physician-scientist investigating redox metabolism in pulmonary vascular disease. With the support and protected time provided by the K08 award, Dr. Oldham will develop expertise in the fields of energy metabolism, redox biochemistry, mitochondrial physiology, and dynamic modeling from formal coursework, independent study, and practical experience with relevant experimental techniques. Dr. Joseph Loscalzo, an internationally recognized expert in these areas with over 30 years of mentoring experience, will mentor Dr. Oldham with the support of an advisory committee composed of outstanding scientists in metabolism and pulmonary disease. As the award period progresses, Dr. Oldham will develop the skills necessary for a successful R01 grant submission. Dr. Oldham will work in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine in the Department of Medicine at BWH, an outstanding scientific and mentoring environment located within the heart of the Harvard Medical School community. Pulmonary arterial hypertension affects 15-50 people per million and elevated pulmonary artery pressures con- tribute to increased morbidity and mortality of millions more affected by lung disease, heart failure, and other conditions. Metabolic abnormalities in PAH offer a rich potential for the development of much-needed disease modifying therapies for this condition. Dr. Oldham's long-term goal is to define the metabolic derangements underlying PAH and to develop therapies targeting the resulting metabolic vulnerabilities. The overall objective of this application is to define the role of L2HG in the pathogenesis of PAH as the first step toward his long- term goal. The central hypothesis is that L2HG production supports pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH by increasing pro-proliferative reactive oxygen species generation in pulmonary vascular cells. The rationale for this proposal is that, once the links between L2HG metabolism and PAH pathogenesis are defined, these bio- chemical pathways can be targeted pharmacologically, resulting in novel and disease-modifying therapies for PAH. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Determine the biochemical link between L2HG metabolism, glycolysis, and cellular redox state using biochemical and kinetic modeling approaches; (2) Determine the impact of L2HG metabolism on pulmonary vascular cell phenotype using genetic manipulations of L2HG levels and readouts of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species production; and (3) Determine the role of L2HG metabolism in the development of PAH using genetically modified mice. The contribution of this work is expected to be a mechanistic understanding of how L2HG metabolism regulates cellular redox homeostasis in support of pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH. This contribution will be significant because it will define a critical role for L2HG in normal and diseased metabolism that will enhance our understanding of the cellular response to hypoxia and other stressors. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by defining an important role for L2HG metabolism in cellular redox homeostasis. This research will open new horizons in the study of intracellular redox signaling. Moreover, this pathway has not been previously associated with PAH and represents a new area for mechanistic investigations of disease pathogenesis. Since L2HG is not an intermediate in any known metabolic pathway, its metabolism may offer safe and tractable experimental and therapeutic tar- gets for manipulating cellular redox state, which would provide a valuable tool for future investigations of this deadly disease."
"9473102","PROJECT SUMMARY ? Clinical Evaluation of a Resorbable Inferior Vena Cava Filter  Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the 3rd leading cause of death, claiming the lives of at least 100,000 Americans annually ? more than breast cancer, AIDS, and vehicle fatalities combined. Metallic Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) filters have been proven effective in reducing PE to about 1-2% in at risk populations; however, they come with a heavy post deployment price, namely the expensive retrieval procedure and long term complications such as caval penetration and end organ puncture.  Our proposal is the continued development to FDA clearance of the first totally absorbable IVC filter to prevent PE. Following dissolution of blood clots, the filter itself vanishes into CO2 and H2O within 8 months. The value proposition is the prevention of PE without requiring filter removal, and alleviation of life-threatening, long term complications of metallic IVC filters. The IVC filter prophylaxis market has been growing 26% annually and is currently $500M, with an untapped market opportunity of approximately 10-fold.  This Phase IIB SBIR program is focused on advancing the totally absorbable IVC filter and delivery system through a clinical trial at leading US academic hospitals in the pursuit of FDA 510(k) clearance. Phase II feasibility has been established with MD Anderson Cancer Center and validated through 5 publications in leading peer-reviewed medical journals. These studies have demonstrated preliminary safety and efficacy in large animals where the filter provided 100% clot capture when challenged with thrombus, without filter migration (0%), caval penetration (0%), caval thrombosis (0%) or PE (0%).  The FDA has been very receptive to our totally absorbable IVC filter and claimed our approach is both ?comprehensive? and ?well thought out? following our two Pre-submission meetings. Aim 1: Complete Filter and Delivery System - finalize filter and catheter delivery system with goals:  ? Meet ISO medical device standards: 37137,10993,25539-3,17137,10555-1,11070,11135,11607-1,  ? Demonstrate one-year shelf life in real-time aging studies, and 95% functionality with 100 units. Aim 2: Conduct US Pivotal Clinical Study ? conduct multicenter clinical trial (6 month follow up) with goals:  ? Recruit 80 patients (70% with proven VTE and contraindicated to anticoagulants, 30% prophylaxis),  ? 82% clinical success (successful technical deployment without subsequent PE or other complications),  ? Pulmonary embolism ? 5%, IVC filter occlusion ? 10%, and filter migration ? 1% per SIR guidelines, Aim 3: File Regulatory Submissions ? file appropriate regulatory documents in collaboration with CRO:  ? File IDE with FDA following completion of filter and delivery system preclinical studies and FIH,  ? File 510(k) package for FDA clearance following multicenter pivotal clinical study,  ? Seek strategic partner for world-wide sales and distribution."

"9462895","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this application is to support the career development of Linnea Polgreen, PhD. Her long-term goal is to become an independent investigator with a research program focused on developing methods for determining the best treatment options based on observational data. She has assembled a team of experienced mentors, including both clinical and quantitative researchers. These mentors not only bring diverse and complementary areas of expertise, but also, all of them have been successful mentors of students and young faculty. With this team of mentors, she will gain insight into what clinical questions she should attempt to answer using quantitative methods, and how to answer them.         Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for determining treatment effectiveness, RCTs are difficult to perform: they are expensive and slow. In the absence of findings from RCTs, observational data are often used to inform treatment decisions. There are a number of strategies available to analyze treatment outcomes using observational data, but exactly which strategy is likely to be most accurate is currently unclear. Her objective in this application is to develop a general framework using methods from economics, epidemiology and computer science and outcome-based observational data to determine treatment effectiveness for medical interventions in general. Specifically, she will use Medicare Part A, B and D data from a cohort of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) to prevent subsequent AMIs, followed 1 year prior to, and up to 4 years post, the index AMI. For Aim 1, she will identify the approach that most accurately reflects ACE inhibitor/ARB outcomes as given by previous RCTs. For Aim 2, she will identify the approach that most accurately estimates treatment effectiveness for patients not generally eligible for RCTs.         Upon successful completion of these aims, she expects to have developed a framework for identifying the advantages and disadvantages of different methods for estimating treatment effectiveness using observational data for a broad range of cardiac and pulmonary diseases."

Now it covers an area of 145sq km with 50 clusters ( geographically contiguous area) of Kanti block &16 villages from other blocks of district Muzaffarpur, Bihar. Last census was conducted in 2015. A total 111,999 from 16301 households were screened and information on current family size, new births and deaths, in/out migration, new cases of Kala-azar . All new 53 Kala-azar cases occurred since last survey (6th in 2013) was confirmed by document verification and rk39 test. It provides an excellent platform for conducting sentinel surveillance of the incidence of VL and PKDL at population level in the heartland of the VL epidemic in Bihar. We will investigate whether the declining trend in numbers of reported VL cases in Bihar State is also reflected in decreasing sero prevalence rates. All field based studies in all TMRC projects will be conducted through same plat form. The HDSS also offers the possibility of studying interaction of VL with other prevalent neglected topical diseases and effect of social and environmental factors known to be associated with VL. PKDL in itself is probably of low priority for the HDSS population but if screening for PKDL is combined with screening for other skin disorders followed by treatment of common treatable conditions, this would probably be very much welcomed. To further explore the apparent discrepancy between tuberculosis case notification figures for India and those for Bihar, the population based approach will allow us to identify all tuberculosis cases, also those treated by private practitioners and possibly not notified. In next TMRC it is decided that all information from the field ( including verbal autopsies) will be collected on tablets."
"9474609","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for The OSU College of Optometry Clinic Site to conduct the Soft Bifocal Contact Lens Myopia Control Study, a randomized clinical trial designed to address whether and by what mechanism commercially available soft bifocal contact lenses may slow eye growth in myopic children. Experimental animal data and numerous but scientifically limited human clinical evaluations suggest that contact lenses that alter peripheral defocus may slow the progression of myopia. The first aim is to conduct a rigorous prospective randomized clinical trial 'to determine if bifocal contact lenses that supply peripheral retinal myopic defocus slow myopia progression in children in a dose-dependent manner as a function of add power. The second aim is to evaluate whether peripheral myopia is a visual signal for eye growth by determining whether the rate of progression follows a dose-dependent response to peripheral myopic retinal defocus. The final aim is to determine the structural correlates of any slowing of myopia progression: is any slowing of eye growth local and peripheral, foveal, global, or confined to one more ocular quadrants. Analyses related to the second and third aims will determine how soft bifocal contact lenses affect growth of the eye and, ultimately, to optimization of the visual signals that slow myopia progression in children. In this trial, 294 children aged 7 to 11 years with myopia will be randomly assigned to wear soft bifocal contact lenses (Biofinity Multifocal with +1.50 add or +2.50 add; Cooper Vision, Fairfield, NY) or single vision contact lenses (Biofinity; Cooper Vision, Fairfield, NY). The primary outcome measure is change in cycloplegic spherical equivalent auto refraction over three years. Secondary outcomes are central and peripheral eye length. Covariates include the amount of peripheral defocus at distance and near while wearing a contact lens, distance peripheral refractive error without a contact lens, high and low contrast visual acuity at distance, high contrast near visual acuity, accommodative lag, pupil size, family refractive error history, a myopia risk factor survey, vision-specific quality of life, and contact lens wear compliance."
"9472876","This Project focuses on the mechanisms by which beta amyloid (Aß) accumulation and inflammation  (specifically interieukin 1 beta; IL-1ß) impair plasticity and neuronal health. We propose that these molecules  interfere with endosomal trafficking of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB,  leading to impaired neuronal health, function and synaptic plasticity. Our data reveal that IL-1 ß and Aß both  interfere with retrograde axonal flow of BDNF-TrkB and impair events downstream from BDNF-TrkB  signaling, including nuclear gene transcription. In addition, we found that IL-1ß impairs the stabilization of  BDNF-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) by preventing actin polymerization in spines. These data  indicate that Aß and IL-iß deteriorate synapses by targeting both pre and post-synaptic components,  impairing signal transduction and synaptic plasticity and placing neurons at risk for degeneration. We  propose that impairment of endosomal trafficking is a common mechanism by which Aß and IL-1ß impair  retrograde signaling and spine plasticity. Supporting the hypothesis that dysfunctional endosomal trafficking  is an important contributor to AD pathogenesis, several recently identified genetic risk factors for AD impact  function of endocytotic pathways (e.g., PICALM, BINI, CD2AP). In this proposal, we will evaluate how Aß  and IL-1ß impair endosomal trafficking, focusing on BDNF-TrkB trafficking, and investigate how signaling  events downstream of BDNF-TrkB are impacted. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will evaluate mechanisms by  which Aß and IL-1ß interfere with endosomal trafficking and axonal retrograde transport of BDNF-TrkB.In  Aim 2, we will determine if IL-1ß impairs postsynaptic activity-dependent BDNF-TrkB trafficking and plasticity  in dendritic spines. We also will eviaute how PICALM can modulate BDNF TrkB trafficking.. Aim 3 will  translate the in-vitro data to an in-vivo paradigm, to investigate if IL-1ß impairs hippocampal-dependent  learning and if select intervention strategies can protect against the detrimental effects of IL-1ß on  endosomal trafficking, and learning. Our project incorporates data sharing and multiple collaborations with  the team: e.g., Glabe (effects of Aß oligomeric species on BDNF-TrkB trafficking), LaFeria (IL-1ß, Aß and  endocytic dysfunction).

"9460987","Summary The older population will more than double from 35 million in 2000 to 72 million in 2030 and comprise almost 20% of the U.S. population. To help avert the disability challenges these individuals will face, the University of Florida (UF) Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) Research Education Core (REC) promotes the development of independent investigators in interdisciplinary research on aging related to older Americans' mobility. This core emphasizes the competency-based development of research and leadership skills for translating basic findings into clinical research and clinical findings into basic research. Key to this approach is our partnerships with UF's NIH-funded Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) and the Veterans Affairs (VA) Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC). Core resources are integrated with other internal and external sources for career support, including UF support; NIH and non-NIH career- development awards, minority supplements, research awards, and fellowships; and CTSI and VA support. The REC supports the research training of Junior Scholars who span the spectrum from beginning trainees not yet funded to advanced trainees who have competed successfully for career-development awards or grants that provide substantial salary support. Beginning Junior Scholars receive direct salary support from the REC to protect their time for career development and research. Advanced Junior Scholars may already have sufficient salary support but are eligible for REC mentorship, staff, Core support and travel resources, and REC training activities. In our first year, we propose eight Junior Scholars from four different UF Colleges (Nursing, Liberal Arts and Sciences, Public Health and Health Professions, and Medicine). Three Junior Scholars have clinical degrees and responsibilities; one is of Hispanic ethnicity; four are women and several have co-funding from key partners, their home departments, and/or extramural career development funding. The REC's overarching goal is to recruit, select, and train talented Junior Scholars committed to translational science and to integrating clinical insights of health/disease and independence/disability in older adults. Using their knowledge of advances in the basic sciences, these Junior Scholars will strive to improve clinical interventions that help the elderly avert mobility loss and maintain independence. We emphasize an interdisciplinary career-development plan that generates combined knowledge from a diverse cadre of scientists (basic, translational, social, behavioral, epidemiological, and clinical). Tailored career-development plans for each proposed REC-supported Junior Scholar, include, but are not limited to: a) a research project integrated with this OAIC's premise; b) a formal training strategy that stresses the integration of basic and clinical research and interactions across the OAIC research spectrum and the other OAIC Core facilities; c) a formal mentorship program that uses a team approach to foster basic and clinical science approaches; and d) a monitoring process to evaluate trainees' progress formally using specific milestones and achievements."

"9605914","Summary A central challenge in neuroscience is to develop methods to manipulate specific cell types within the mammalian brain. Recent developments in optogenetics have revolutionized our ability to control the activity of both neurons and non-neuronal cells. However, this approach suffers from one drawback, the difficulty in delivery light stimulus to target cells that are located deep within the brain or the body. The Chalasani lab has recently demonstrated a noninvasive method to control the activity of neurons. They have identified a pore- forming subunit of a mechanosensitive channel (TRP-4) that responds to low-intensity ultrasound. Further, they showed that expressing this channel is specific cells renders those target cells sensitive to mechanical deformations generated by noninvasive ultrasound waves. This proposal aims to develop this approach (they have termed ?sonogenetics?) to control specific cells within the mouse brain. Further, they find that this approach can be used to control the activity of mammalian neurons in vitro. They plan on using a high- throughput assay system to test whether other members of the TRP-N family are sensitive to ultrasound pulses. Additionally, they will also analyze whether altering the number of ankyrin repeats affects the ultrasound responsiveness of these channels (consistent with a recent study showing similar results in the Drosophila TRP-N channel) (Aim 1). They also plan on developing a new head device with a slot for a tiny, lightweight ultrasound transducer to deliver ultrasound stimulus to the mouse brain (Aim 2). Finally, they will test the efficacy of the sonogenetic approach in vivo using electrophysiological and behavioral analysis. They will express TRP-4 or other mechanosensitive channels in cortical PV interneurons, striatal D1 or D2 medium spiny projection neurons and control their activity in vivo. Optogenetic methods have been previously used to control these cell populations providing benchmarks for comparison. These studies will develop a noninvasive method to manipulate the activity of specific cells within the rodent brain or its body. Further, these methods can be translated into the human to target specific cell populations for therapeutic purposes."
"9452123","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) is a disabling mental disorder that affects ~ 1 % of the population worldwide and the seventh most costly illness in USA. It alters basic brain processes of perception, emotion, and judgment to cause hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, anhedonia and cognitive deficits. Unlike neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, SZ lacks pathological hallmarks and thus remains one of the least understood brain disorders. SZ is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder, resulting from problems during neural development that lead to impaired neurotransmission and plasticity in adolescent and adult. Although hypofunction of glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways have been implicated, underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Recent identification of SZ susceptibility genes and studies of their functions have begun to shed light on its pathophysiology. Both neuregulin 1 (NRG1), a growth factor, and its receptor ErbB4 are SZ risk genes in diverse populations based on association studies. This notion is supported by recent meta-analysis, genome-wide association study, and genome-wide copy number analysis. Consistent with the neurodevelopmental hypothesis for SZ, NRG1 and ErbB4 have been implicated in various steps of neural development. In particular, ErbB4 is expressed specifically in interneurons and both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that ErbB4 plays a critical role in the assembly of the GABAergic circuitry. On the other hand, NRG1 and ErbB4 are expressed in the adult brain; acute treatment with NRG1 increases GABA release in the cortex and hippocampus. Blocking NRG1/ErbB4 signaling reduces GABA release, increases the firing of pyramidal neurons, and enhances long term potentiation (LTP). ErbB4 mutant mice exhibit SZ-relevant behavioral deficits including impaired PPI and working memory. While these observations are exciting, several critical questions are raised. Despite NRG1 and ErbB4 are known to promote GABAergic transmission, a glaring gap in our understanding of their function in the brain is that little is known about exactly how NRG1 stimulates GABA release from interneurons. Are behavioral deficits observed in adult ErbB4 mutant mice due to abnormal neural development, or synaptic dysfunction in adulthood, or both? Can adult ErbB4 expression mitigate behavioral deficits and synaptic dysfunction? To address these questions, we 1) investigate mechanisms by which NRG1 promotes GABA release; 2) identify the critical time window for ErbB4 mutation to cause synaptic dysfunction and behavioral deficits; and 3) investigate the role of ErbB4 kinase activity in synaptic function and behavior by acute inhibition Results will provide proof-of-principle evidence that relevant SZ may be treatable by recovering or restoring ErbB4 expression or activity. Such information could be useful to studies of other SZ susceptibility genes and to development of novel therapeutic strategies of the devastating disorder."
"9546170","Abstract  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disease in which hemoglobin pathologically polymerizes in red blood cells (RBC). This results in elongation of RBCs (the ?sickle? shape) and increased RBC stiffness that subsequently causes poor blood flow followed by life-threatening organ damage, which typically occurs in the low oxygenated venous circulation. However, newer research has definitively demonstrated that SCD is much more complex than originally thought. For example, almost of the blood vessels in SCD patients, in the arterial as well as venous circulations, are known to be dysfunctional and prone to inflammation, which in turn, predisposes patients to acute and poorly understood complications such as stroke. Recent work has also demonstrated that all blood cells including RBCs, white blood cells, and platelets pathologically adhere and interact with endothelial cells, the cells that line the inner wall of blood vessels, which contribute to the pro- inflammatory state of the endothelium. However, this likely does not account for all of the endothelial dysfunction seen in SCD and as such, this pathological process remains poorly understood.  For this R21 grant, the bioengineering hematology laboratory of Wilbur Lam, MD, PhD and the computational fluid dynamics lab of Michael Graham, PhD, will continue their longstanding collaboration to investigate a novel hypothesis: that the stiffened RBCs in SCD are constantly colliding with endothelial cells to induce cell dysfunction. We base this hypothesis on two well-documented biophysical phenomena described by labs including our own: 1) blood cells predominantly flow in the center of blood vessels and but are driven towards the endothelial cells (i.e., cell margination) when they become stiffer (as is the case in SCD), and 2) endothelial cells ?feel? physical forces and biologically respond to aberrant forces by activating inflammatory pathways.  As these biophysical variables are too difficult to control in in vivo SCD animal models, to explore our hypothesis, we will analyze SCD patient blood samples in in vitro ?endothelialized? microvasculature-on-a-chip devices developed by the Lam Lab coupled with the computational modeling techniques developed by the Graham Lab. Specifically, we will determine the effects of perfusing SCD RBCs of different shapes and stiffnesses on endothelial function, as measured with antibody staining of cellular markers of inflammation, using our in vitro vasculature models coupled with complex single cell computational modeling to gain systematic and mechanistic insight into our experimental data. Furthermore, we will also assess how the hemodynamic flow pattern (different flow rates with steady versus pulsatile flow) and complex vessel geometry (e.g. size, curvature, bifurcation) affect SCD RBC margination and therefore endothelial pro-inflammatory pathways. Overall, this work will determine whether purely non-adhesive, physical interactions between endothelial cells and SCD RBCs are sufficient to cause endothelial dysfunction, which may help explain why SCD patients develop stroke and may lead to a new paradigm of physics-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for SCD."
"9472875","Project 1: Intracellular amyloid accumulation, innate immunity and pathogenesis.  Project 1 proposes that the accumulation of intracellular amyloid contributes to pathogenesis by activating  an innate inflammatory cascade that represents a futile attempt to degrade or eliminate this amyloid by  activating autophagy and ultimately leading to neuronal death and the initiation of a neuritic plaque. Project  1 examines the contribution of two unique types of amyloid immunoreactivity to aging and AD through this  inflammatory mechanism and it explores the potential role of late onset AD genes in this process. One type  of unique amyloid involves the dramatic accumulation of amyloid fibril monoclonal (M78) immunoreactivity in  nuclei in human and Tg mouse brain, which is correlated with intraneuronal nuclear accumulation of APP  immunoreactivity. The nuclear amyloid immunoreactivity is specifically associated with eariy plaque  pathology (stage A or B) in humans and at 12 months in 3xTg-AD transgenic mice. The staining is reduced  or absent in late stage AD and at later times in transgenic mice. The other type of unique amyloid is  specifically associated with subset of vascular amyloid. Confocal immunofluorescence indicates that the  M31 immunoreactive vascular amyloid accumulates at least partially intracellularly in vascular smooth  muscle cells. The goals of project 1 are to test the hypothesis that the accumulation of the amyloids  represent an infection of the cell with a prion like agent that is associated with activation of the innate  immune response. Specific aim 1 will establish the fundamental characteristics of the accumulation of these  unique types of amyloid and test the hypothesis that their accumulation is associated with leakage of  lysosomal cathepsins and cystatin c into the cytosol and activation of the NLR infiammasome, resulting in  the activation of caspase 1 leading to neuronal death by a mechanism related to NETosis. Specific aim 2  will examine whether LOAD genes, PICALM, clusterin and TREM2, recentiy identified by GWAS play a role  in the intracellular accumulation of the unique amyloids. Specific aim 3 will explore whether these unique  types of amyloid display fundamental properties of infectious agents, like prions and whether they can be  propagated by seeding to cells. We will determine whether the the phenotype of the infected cells matches  the intracellular amyloid pathology in human brain. Dr. Glabe's project 1 will provide Dr. Cotman with  oligomers. Project 1 will interact with Dr. LaFeria on intracellular APP and Aß in the 3XTg-AD mouse and  AAV vectors and Dr. Cribbs on the accumulation of vascular amyloid.

Although the hippocampus has been one of the most intensively studied brain areas, based on its importance for declarative memory, relatively little is known about the CA2 region since its initial description by Lorente de N? in 1934. In contrast there is a wealth of information about th functional properties and synaptic connections of the other major regions of hippocampus including dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1. The lack of attention paid to CA2 has been largely due to experimental and technical difficulties in studying this relatively small region that occupies a transitional zone between CA3 and CA1. This situation has impeded our understanding of how hippocampus encodes memories and how alterations in hippocampal function contribute to psychiatric and neurological disorders as CA2 has been implicated schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as in epilepsy. Moreover, CA2 pyramidal neurons exhibit some of the highest levels of expression in the brain of the vasopressin 1b receptor, which has been implicated in both normal social behavior and autism.  Over the past several years it has become increasingly clear that CA2 does indeed form a separate region with its own molecular identity and distinct electrophysiological properties (as shown, in part, by recent data from our laboratory). These molecular studies have enabled us to generate a mouse line that expresses Cre recombinase in CA2 pyramidal neurons, thereby allowing us to selectively label and manipulate CA2 excitatory output. Our initial experiments have used this mouse to identify some of the major inputs and outputs of the CA2 pyramidal neurons. Moreover by expressing tetanus toxin selectively in CA2 we have been able to inactivate its synaptic output and explore the behavioral consequences of CA2 silencing. Surprisingly, we find that inactivation of CA2 has little effect on a number of mouse behaviors, with no significant change in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory (Morris water maze), contextual fear conditioning, or novel object recognition. In stark contrast, silencing of CA2 results in a profound loss of social memory, the ability of a mouse to recognize a previously encountered mouse. Here we propose to employ this mouse line to examine in more detail both the anatomical and functional synaptic connectivity of CA2 pyramidal neurons and to explore more deeply the role of CA2 in various social and non-social forms of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory.  Given the changes in social behavior associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders, some of which have been linked to CA2, our experiments offer potential insights into both basic mechanisms of memory storage and the neural bases of altered cognitive processing important for social interactions."
"9546682","This TRD, Hardware and High Field, has been in existence since 2010 and has been addressing the demands for increased spatial resolution, sensitivity and speed as well as solving problems of high magnetic field, by developing novel MR hardware. We propose to continue this focus on technology development, particularly focusing our work on solving neuroimaging problems at high field (3T) and ultra-high-field (7T and above). With regard to the latter, it is known that there are still substantial technical innovations needed to make ultrahigh- field MRI routine, stable and consistently superior to the best available clinical MRI systems, in all parts of the body. The technical challenges related to gradient, shim and RF performance, decreased B0 and B1 homogeneity, and increased RF power deposition are the most critical. These challenges are the basis for much of the present research activity in the UHF MRI world, and many creative solutions are being found. But one underlying principle is clear: solving these problems will demand innovation in the design, implementation and application of high-performance hardware sub-subsystems. It is also clear that even at field strengths lower than 7T, many improvements in image quality would be enabled through novel hardware development. From the Human Connectome Project comes a clear demand for increased gradient performance, which is needed both for more efficient diffusion encoding and for faster and higher resolution spatial encoding. Yet body-size gradients have now reached hard amplitude and slew rate limits set by human peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds, and therefore any further increases in gradient performance will require innovation in smaller size gradient coils, most obviously head-size gradients. Along with the demands for better gradients come new requirements for better B0 shimming and B1 / radio frequency performance. In this TRD project, we will pursue projects involving major hardware design, construction and analysis in all three of these principal hardware subsystems of the MR scanner."
"9623592","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will develop novel Bayesian approaches to handle missingness and conduct causal inference for important problems in biomedical research with particular relevance to cancer and behavioral studies. Missing data is a major problem in clinical studies. Of late, more e ort is spent to try to minimize the amount of missingness, but it remains a problem. We will address several pressing complications in the analysis of incomplete data in clinical settings as documented in a recent National Academies of Science report, including assessing model t to the observed data, developing Bayesian approaches for auxiliary covariates, and nonparametric modeling of nonignorable missingness. The mechanisms of treatment effectiveness are of particular interest in behavioral trials. Specifically, how do different processes mediate the effect of an intervention? This can facilitate constructing future interventions. However, determining the causal effect of such 'mediators' on the outcomes is difficult. We will develop new approaches to identify these effects in complex settings with multiple mediators and longitudinal mediators for which little work has been done. Another important question is how to de ne and identify causal effects of interventions on outcomes in the setting of semi-competing risks. Semi-competing risks occur in studies where a progression endpoint may be pre-empted by death or censored due to loss to follow-up or study termination. Subjects who experience a progression event are also followed for survival, which may be censored. Data of this form has been termed semi-competing risks data. This paradigm is particularly relevant to certain brain cancer trials, where the semi-competing risks are death and cerebellar progression. For all these settings, a Bayesian approach is ideal as it allows one to appropriately characterize uncertainty about invariable assumptions (which are present in all these problems).  The methods developed here will help answer numerous important clinical questions including the mechanisms of behavior change, both in weight management and smoking cessation, via the ability to appropriately assess mediation, and the joint causal effect of treatment on time to death and cerebellar progression in brain cancer. We will disseminate code for these methods (via the PI's webpage) to ensure the methods will be readily usable by investigators in their own studies.  The history of the PI's collaboration with the PI's of the individual clinical studies and the statistician co- investigators will help the team produce the best science and facilitate dissemination of our clinical findings and new methods to the appropriate audience via both subject matter publications and presentations at relevant conferences."
"9527175","PROJECT SUMMARY: Although the association between educational attainment and physical health outcomes?including leading causes of mortality like cardiovascular disease?is well known to be large in magnitude, enduring over the life course, and invariant across sex, race, and ethnicity, there are few existing studies that are capable of prospectively disambiguating aspects of early education that are most predictive of physical health in adulthood and thus most productively targeted in intervention and prevention efforts. Likewise, few studies of the school context are also well positioned to incorporate in the same sample correlated aspects of risk in children's early home environments that might initiate a developmental cascade resulting in poorer physical health outcomes in adulthood via childhood educational experiences. To address these limitations, the current application is designed to leverage the landmark NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD; 1991- 2006), a large-scale, prospective study of children thus far followed prospectively from birth, to evaluate a life course model whereby early life adversity is hypothesized to confer risk for intermediate health outcomes relevant to health risk partially through correlated variation in both a) academic achievement and attainment and b) educational experiences during childhood (e.g., the quality of educational experiences, both interpersonal and instructional in nature). Building on an NHLBI-sponsored follow-up of the female sub-sample of the SECCYD (pending R01HL130103, PI: Bleil, to begin 7/1/16), funding for the current application will enable identical assessments in the male participants including relevant parameters of health/disease risk. This effort will produce a high powered study of 750 total SECCYD participants (~50% male; ages 25-30 over study period), assuming 80% return of 940 participants. The follow-up visit will involve assessments in domains of cardio-metabolic and inflammation known to predict long-term risk for disease derived from a physical examination, blood draw, and comprehensive medical history/health behavior evaluation. These new measures generated from the current study will be examined in relation to existing, state-of-the-art assessments of early life environments and educational achievement/experiences acquired as a part of the original SECCYD data collection on both genders. Early life adversity will be characterized using measures of childhood SES, infant-mother attachment, maternal sensitivity, father absence, negative life events, and maltreatment. Academic achievement will be assessed using teacher-reported and objective assessments of academic skills whereas educational experiences will be studied using classroom observations along with questionnaire assessments of the quality of teacher-child relationships. In sum, the proposed study reflects a unique, time-sensitive opportunity to examine longitudinally the extent to which academic achievement and/or the quality of childhood educational experiences uniquely predict health risk in adulthood, as well as to explore childhood variables that moderate, and adult behavioral/lifestyle variables that mediate these prospective associations."
"9497755","Core B: Summary   A well integrated data management system was established during the first funding   period of this TMRC program. In this second round of the program i.e. the current funding   period, we have been able to achieve our goal of establishing a Health and Demographic   Surveillance System (HDSS) in the Muzaffarpur district through which ongoing monitoring of   the population and associated health/disease data is maintained. We propose to maintain the   HDSS during the next 5 years, and continue the HDSS as an entity that will eventually become   independent of this TMRC. In this renewal request, we propose to extend the capacity of the   Data Management core to establish a bioinformatics unit to support analyses of the large   databases that are being accumulated in all 3 projects. The core will continue to process and   maintain data on parasite loads and HLA type for many subjects in the HDSS. As such,   maintenance and constant improvement of the data management procedures, and innovative   approaches to biostatistical and bioinformatic analyses, are warranted. Goals of the Data and   Biostatistics core are:   1. To maintain full in-house data management capacity at BHU in Varanasi and its   associated field site in Muzaffarpur, Bihar state. This includes maintenance and quality control   of an electronic data management system operating at BHU.   2. To maintain a record of specimens through the data management system, linking   specimens to the database. The use of specimens and distribution between investigators of   different projects will be catalogued through the specimen control system, managed by the   head of the specimen control.   3. To provide support and quality control mechanisms for HDSS core and other   research projects. This will include the development and revision of Standard Operating   Procedures (SOPs), specimen collection, specimen handling, data management and clinical   monitoring procedures.   4. To provide expertise and support in biostatistics, allowing ongoing analysis of   programs and feedback to regarding SOPs and data management.   5. To develop and establish expertise and support in bioinformatics, including analytic   methods for metabolomes, transcriptomes and microbiomes.  The system is designed to allow BHU to carry out FDA-compliant clinical trials or vaccine  studies in the future."
"9455817","?    DESCRIPTION: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common primary brain malignancy, carries a grim prognosis. Currently, there are no effective treatments for this disease. Gene therapy has been long time considered as a promising approach for this disease, which, however, has not seen much progress over the past many decades. This can be potentially attributed to two major factors, including: 1) the lack of approaches for simultaneously overcoming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for drug delivery to the brain and the cellular barriers for induction of genetic materials to cells with adequate efficiency; and 2) the lack of molecular targets that can also be effectively manipulated for elimination of GBM tumor cells, including the stem-like cells within the bulk cell population. Here, we propose testing a new strategy that is designed for adequately overcoming these hurdles: autocatalytic delivery of brain tumor-targeted nanoparticles loaded with Cas9/sgRNAs designed for elimination of genes that regulate the survival of bulk cell population as well as the stem-like cell population within GBM. In preliminary work, we proposed and tested an innovative mechanism for systemic drug delivery to the brain, called autocatalytic brain tumor-targeted (ABTT) delivery, based on which we synthesized ABTT nanoparticles (NPs) using a novel solid polymer. We demonstrated that ABTT NPs efficiently overcome the BBB and the cellular barrier and were capable of mediating effective gene therapy for treatment of brain tumors. Along this progress, we identified a group of genes through a genome wide RNAi screening as novel candidates for GBM gene therapy. In addition, we demonstrated that Cas9/sgRNA-mediated genetic knockout allowed producing more persistent inhibitory effects than the traditional RNAi approach. Based on this progress, we propose to test our strategy by optimizing and characterizing ABTT NPs for systemic delivery of Cas9/sgRNAs to GBM in Aim 1, characterizing and selecting genes with excellent biological activity in inhibition of GBM in Aim 2, and determining the therapeutic benefit of systemic gene therapy in Aim 3. Successful completion of the proposed study will establish a novel regimen for effective treatment of patients with GBM."
"9452127","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Taupathology is a prominent feature of multiple neurological diseases known collectively as tauopathies. These include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Cortical Basal Degeneration (CBD), Pick's disease, and Frontotemporal Dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. Some of these diseases are hereditary, associated with mutations in the tau gene, but normal tau may also be pathological. Although each tauopathy has a disease specific phenotype, histological presentation, morphology, and neurological presentation, all of them are associated with misfolded tau and altered phosphorylation of tau. The search for a common pathogenic mechanism has been hindered by this clinical diversity. Two recent findings provide new insight into tau pathology. The first is identification of conformation specific tau antibodies that recognize some, but not all, pathological forms of tau, suggesting conformational diversity within the tauopathies. Second, our recent demonstration of a biologically active motif in the tau amino terminus that activates a signaling pathway involving protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b): 17 amino acids comprising a Phosphatase Activation Domain (PAD) provides a molecular basis for altered kinase activities in tauopathies. The central hypothesis of this application is that pathogenic forms of tau represent a misregulation of a normal biological function for tau as a scaffold for localization and regulation of microtubule based kinases and phosphatases. This PAD region is aberrantly displayed in all pathological forms of tau examined to date and is a necessary component of at least two forms of tau toxicity: inhibition of fast axonal transport and cell toxicity in culture. We propose that pathological forms of tau in different tauopathies are structurally distinct with variable degrees f toxicity. Experiments in this application will characterize the conformations of tau from different tauopathies and evaluate their relative toxicity in affecting the PP1/GSK3b pathway and axonal transport using authentic and synthetic aggregates. We further hypothesize that toxicity of different tau conformers may be modulated by disease specific patterns of tau phosphorylation and conformation. Disease specific patterns of these alterations will be determined for AD, PSP and CBD. Normal and pathological functions of tau will be analyzed to test the hypothesis that tau serves as a scaffold for localizing and regulating specific kinases and phosphatases to microtubules. We will focus on the role of tau in the normal regulation of PP1 and GSK3b in microtubule rich domains of the axon and identify interaction domains with tau for these phosphotransferases. The localization of the PP1/GSK3b pathway by tau allows for spatial and temporal control of these activities and we propose that presentation of PAD is restricted to specific subcellular compartments in normal neurons and deregulated in pathological states. Consistent with this model, tau, PP1 and GSK3b have all been implicated in neuronal development. Developmental regulation of tau isoforms, conformation, and phosphorylation may play critical roles in neuronal development. We suggest that the regulated presentation of PAD is important for neurite outgrowth and targeting of axonal proteins during normal neuronal development and function, allowing us to understand the relationship between the toxicity of misfolded tau and normal tau function."
"9452905","PROJECT SUMMARY  There are two options to treat the pain and stiffness of tibiotalar OA: arthrodesis and total ankle replacement (TAR). Arthrodesis involves fusing the tibia and talus and is performed in most patients. With motion completely lost at the tibiotalar joint, 50% of arthrodesis patients are unable to return to their desired activities. Eliminating tibiotalar motion may also force the adjacent joints, including the subtalar, talonavicular, and calcaneocuboid joints to undergo compensatory hypermobility. Although not confirmed, excessive motion may cause OA at these adjacent joints. Total ankle replacement is an attractive alternative to arthrodesis as it may reduce compensatory motion by opening degrees of freedom at the tibiotalar joint. However, 33% of TAR implants fail within 10 years. Also, about 15% of TAR patients develop arthritis at the adjacent joints.  With poor 10-year outcomes, TAR remains reserved for older patients. Yet, over a lifetime, younger patients may stand to benefit the most from the functionality offered by TAR. Our ultimate goal is to make TAR a viable option for restoring mobility to patients ? young and old Quantification of in-vivo kinematics (i.e. angles and translations) of the tibiotalar and adjacent joints is essential to design TAR implants that increase longevity and improve functionality. Prior studies have not measured in-vivo kinematics of the tibiotalar joint independent from the adjacent joints in TAR or arthrodesis patients. Our group has developed and validated a dual-fluoroscopy (DF) system that accurately measures in-vivo motion of each joint. DF visualizes motion relative to bony anatomy and implanted hardware, yielding ?joint arthrokinematics?. Arthrokinematic data could identify features of a TAR implant that impede articulation, motivating design changes. These data could also drive computer models that predict stresses at the bone-implant interface to identify modes of TAR failure.  We propose an R21 study to measure in-vivo joint arthrokinematics during walking, stair-ascent, and balanced heelrise in: 1) post-TAR, 2) post-arthrodesis, and 3) non-pathologic controls. Compared to controls, we hypothesize: 1) motion of the adjacent joints in arthrodesis patients is increased, 2) motion of the adjacent joints in TAR patients is increased, and 3) motion of the prosthetic tibiotalar joint in TAR patients is reduced. Confirming Hypothesis 1 will provide mechanistic evidence of compensatory motion that is clinically believed to instigate OA in the joints adjacent to the fusion site. In addition, confirmation of Hypothesis 1 will provide rationale to focus future research directives on projects that advance TAR. Demonstrating that hypermobility is not eliminated (Hypothesis 2), and that TT motion is restricted (Hypothesis 3), following TAR will indicate that improvements to TAR are still required. Although an exploratory study, completion of this R21 will yield the only in-vivo measurements of articulation for the tibiotalar and adjacent joints in these cohorts. Importantly, data collected herein will support a body of future research designed to meet our ultimate goal."

"9459404","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite making up only 2% of the US population, men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 67% of new HIV infections in 2014, and incidence rates among adolescent MSM are alarmingly high in some areas. One potential barrier to the effectiveness of biomedical HIV prevention interventions among MSM is the physiologic efficiency of HIV transmission across the rectal mucosa, where approximately 70% of infections are thought to occur among MSM. However, the majority of HIV mucosal transmission research has concentrated on vaginal transmission in women and non-human primates, which is then extrapolated to understanding the mechanisms of rectal transmission among MSM. In addition, the role of inflammation in the rectal mucosa attributed to bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STI), including Chlamydia (CT), Gonorrhea (GC), and syphilis, has been understudied to date despite the tremendous burden of STI in MSM and their influence on HIV transmission. We have previously shown that rectal STI, even in the setting of routine screening and treatment, is associated with HIV seroconversion in a cohort of HIV-negative MSM. For HIV positive MSM, our prior work shows that rectal shedding of HIV remains low in men on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) with rectal GC and/or CT; however, sampling of the mucosa was not optimal to detect low level shedding in this study. In the absence of rectal STI, preliminary data presented in this application with adult HIV-negative MSM aged 18-45 show a distinct innate and adaptive pro-inflammatory immune response to condomless receptive anal intercourse (CRAI) in the rectal mucosa, and that the diversity and composition of the rectal mucosal microbiota differ between adult MSM who engage in CRAI versus men who do not engage in anal intercourse (AI) with MSM engaging in CRAI being enriched for the family Prevotellaceae. In this application, we propose to expand our rectal mucosal studies of MSM to examine the effect of bacterial STI on the rectal mucosal resident cellular populations (aim1) and the microbiome (aim2). In aim 3, we will study resolution of inflammation after treatment of STI and its effect on ex vivo HIV infection of the rectal mucosa. We will build upon our successful translational mucosal immunology program with a highly successful clinical research and retention infrastructure that was designed to understand factors that may influence rectal transmission among MSM. A better understanding of the host response to STI in the rectum will be useful to the design of biomedical HIV and bacterial STI prevention mechanisms, including effective vaccines."
"9471800","Project Summary Reducing reimbursement levels within a fee-for-service environment is a promising approach for reducing ineffective and unproven care when revoking coverage entirely or shifting financial risk to providers are infeasible. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was rapidly adopted into practice as a treatment for breast and prostate cancer patients in the early to mid-2000s despite the absence of high quality evidence demonstrating its superiority to conventional radiotherapy. Based on the rising volume of claims for IMRT and a Wall St. Journal article calling attention to the perverse incentives inherent in physician self-referral for IMRT, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) cut the payment rate for IMRT by 15% between 2012 and 2013. Using Medicare claims data, we propose to study the impact of the payment cut on the use of IMRT and medical costs. We will study trends in the use of IMRT across three patient groups that differ in their ability to benefit from IMRT: prostate cancer patients receiving initial treatment, prostate cancer patients receiving radiotherapy following prostatectomy, and breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy following breast conserving surgery. We will use several strategies to accurately estimate the impact of the payment cut. The magnitude of the cut differed across CMS payment areas. We will determine if declines in the use of IMRT were larger in areas that experienced steeper cuts. Separately, we will compare trends in the use of IMRT in three practice settings that differ in terms of the impact of the cut on practice income: self-referring physician offices, non-self-referring physician offices, and hospital outpatient departments (which were unaffected by the cut)."
"9528907","Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) in pregnancy has been associated with an increased incidence of a spectrum of birth defects collectively referred to as Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS). We have demonstrated that the rhesus macaque is susceptible to ZIKV strains of French Polynesian, African, and American (Puerto Rican) origin, and our published and unpublished work has shown that vertical transmission in rhesus macaques is highly efficient: 5 of 5 fetuses, whether maternal infection was administered in the first or the third trimester, resulted in detectable vRNA in fetal tissues, and histopathology (chiefly inflammation) in fetal organs. Nonetheless, there is minimal understanding of the pathway by which ZIKV traverses the maternal-fetal barrier in vivo. Understanding how virus is afforded access to the fetal compartment will allow consideration of possible interventions. We have revised this proposal to study vertical transmission in the rhesus monkey during the first month after maternal infection to directly address this need, with the following Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1. To determine the pathway by which ZIKV transits the maternal-fetal interface in vertical transmission in vivo by assessing viral RNA burden in maternal, placental and fetal tissues. Specific Aim 2. To define the cellular impact of ZIKV infection by assessing tissue histopathology in parallel with virus localization at the maternal-fetal interface and in fetal tissues. Specific Aim 3. To define decidual leukocyte and placental Hofbauer cell populations with high-dimensional flow cytometry, and directly assess ZIKV infection with intracellular ZIKV antigen staining. With these Aims we will use the NHP model to comprehensively advance our understanding of the pathway and trajectory of vertical transmission of ZIKV. We will define the viral burden at the maternal-fetal interface during the processes leading to fetal infection. We will identify the cellular compartments which contain ZIKV protein and replicating virus. Finally, we will define the immunological responses in the maternal decidua and the fetal placenta during vertical transmission. To accomplish these goals, we will work with a team of expert NHP virologists who have established the macaque model of ZIKV infection, and pathologists and reproductive immunologists who can provide expert and comprehensive assessment of both maternal and fetal outcomes of ZIKV infection. The development of therapies requires insight into pathogenesis. By defining the pathway(s) of vertical transmission, we will have established a relevant NHP experimental platform for testing approaches to interrupt vertical transmission and the development of CZS in human infants."
"9451326","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a fundamental gap in understanding how an appropriate balance of excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) connectivity is achieved during development of cortical networks and adjusted through synaptic plasticity for normal functioning of the cerebral cortex. Until this gap is filled, understanding neuropsychiatric disorders with GABAergic inhibitory connection deficits, such as schizophrenia and autism, will remain a mystery. The long term goal is to identify the molecular mechanisms that establish E/I balance in the prefrontal cortex, which may identify new targets for disorders where this balance is altered. The objective is to define a novel mechanism for limiting inhibitory connections between basket interneurons and the perisomatic region of pyramidal neurons in developing prefrontal cortex. The central hypothesis is that neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM, tyrosine kinase EphA3, and ADAM10 metalloprotease comprise a presynaptic receptor complex for postsynaptic ephrinA5 that promotes elimination of perisomatic synapses critical for proper prefrontal network organization and functioning, such as in working memory. Aim 1. To identify a novel molecular mechanism for limiting perisomatic basket cell innervation in the developing mouse prefrontal cortex through NCAM-dependent ephrinA5/EphA3 signaling We will identify NCAM/EphA3 binding sites, assess the ability of NCAM to stabilize EphA3 on the cell surface by inhibiting endocytosis and promoting ephrinA5-induced EphA3 kinase signaling, and define the developmental and activity-dependent regulation of ephrinA5 in mouse prefrontal cortex. Aim 2. To define presynaptic and postsynaptic functions of NCAM, ephrinA5/EphA3, and ADAM10 metalloprotease in perisomatic inhibitory synapse regulation  Analysis of new conditional NCAM and ADAM10 mutant mice and cell-specific expression in brain slices will distinguish pre- versus post-synaptic functions for NCAM, ephrinA5/EphA3, and ADAM10, and test causal roles for their interactions in perisomatic synapse regulation. Dynamics of inhibitory synapse elimination will be analyzed by time-lapse two-photon microscopy in cortical slice cultures. Aim 3. To delineate the contribution of NCAM to prefrontal cortical network organization and function using optogenetic mapping and behavioral assessment of working memory.  Optogenetic mapping will be performed in brain slices from NCAM null and conditional mutant mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 from the VGAT promoter in interneurons. Working memory performance will be measured in live mice by the delayed non-match-to-sample T-maze task.  The outcome of these studies is expected to have a sustained, positive impact, because it will illuminate novel molecular mechanisms of interneuronal connectivity that control cognitive function, while innovative optogenetic technology will elucidate cortical networks targeted in neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9464558","Project Summary The present application ?Novel Treatment for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder? addresses the critical need for more efficacious treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, activates a key neural signaling cascade upon a trauma experience. In this activation, glutamate binds to and activates the NMDA receptor, a glutamate receptor subtype. Binding and activation triggers the formation of a complex at the receptor and leads to activation of the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and a concomitant increase in the production of the signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO). These events trigger aberrant synaptic plasticity that is implicated in the initiation and maintenance of PTSD. Postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) targets nNOS to the NMDA receptor facilitating the formation of this signaling complex. PSD95 is therefore, required for NMDA receptor activation of nNOS. Lai, Anagin co-founder and principal investigator for this project, first showed that the small molecule, IC87201, disrupts the functional protein-protein interaction between nNOS and PSD95 in vitro and attenuates NMDA receptor dependent hyperalgesia in vivo. Anagin, an Indiana-based small business and its preclinical team at Indiana University, led by Dr. Shekhar (co-founder of Anagin), has demonstrated that IC87201 and a related analog, ZL006, block the long-term encoding of conditioned fear even after a fear conditioning session has occurred (i.e. post- trauma). Unlike NMDA receptor antagonists, these protein interaction inhibitors are efficacious in suppressing PTSD-like symptoms in a well-established preclinical model without producing motor or memory impairment. Thus, disruption of signal compartmentalization represents an innovative approach to develop novel treatments for anxiety disorders with fewer side-effects. In Anagin's successful SBIR Phase I studies, the team established positive structural-activity-relationship and demonstrated oral efficacy of its first-generation lead and identified a promising new chemical series. The goal of this Phase II SBIR is to deliver an orally available drug candidate and initiate IND-enabling studies delineated through two specific aims. Aim 1: Perform lead optimization studies to select a Drug Development Candidate. Aim 2: Validate the Drug Development Candidate in IND-enabling studies. A traditional drug medicinal chemistry approach will be used to design and develop novel analogs with improved pharmacokinetic properties and potency compared to the parent compounds. Anagin anticipates completion of initial IND-enabling studies at the end of the grant period. The development of effective pharmacotherapies with novel chemical structures that possess limited side-effect profiles is expected to drive down escalating health care costs and alleviate unnecessary suffering in PTSD patients.

The candidate is an epidemiologist, who has been well trained in linear modeling and brings an understanding of the role of partner context on risk behaviors (i.e. condom use and concurrency). To become a successful independent investigator with a career focused on addressing the significant and complex problem of adolescent marijuana use, the candidate requires additional training on the etiology and trajectories of marijuana use and dependence, the development and impact of romantic and peer relationships on decision-making around health compromising behaviors, formal and practical training in complex System Dynamics and mathematical modeling, and a deep understanding of legal and ethical issues associated with adolescent substance use research. The long-term goals of the candidate are to become an independent investigator focused on improving adolescent health by identifying opportunities for health promotion and developmentally appropriate primary drug use prevention strategies. Marijuana use is a significant public health problem due to the breadth of health and social consequences associated with its use. Adolescent marijuana use may be an intractable problem because it is embedded in a complex system. The short-term goals of the candidate are to gain the knowledge and skills to apply a systems science approach to illuminate how the context of romantic relationships drives adolescents' uptake, continuation and escalation of marijuana use. To attain these short- and long-term goals, the training component of the award includes 4 activities: 1) develop expertise in the etiology, physiology and trajectories of adolescent and young adult marijuana abuse and dependence, 2) build a theoretical foundation of sexual, dating and romantic relationships over the course of heterosexual adolescent and young adult development, 3) gain advanced skills in systems science methods, including group model building and mathematical modeling, and 4) gain an understanding of the complex ethical issues involved in drug use research with vulnerable adolescents and young adults. The research component of the award is to quantify the influence of romantic partners on adolescent marijuana use, and to use systems science methodology to incorporate important complexities of peer socialization processes. Specific Aim 1 is to use longitudinal data to estimate the contribution of romantic partner and non-romantic peer influence on adolescent marijuana use. This knowledge will serve as the foundation for developing a quantitative System Dynamics model, which will examine whether there is an effect of romantic partners and the relative magnitude of romantic partners and non-romantic peer influence on frequency of adolescent marijuana use over time. Specific Aim 2 is to use participatory model building (e.g., convened group of multidisciplinary academic and community experts and a group of youth) to create a system diagram incorporating key components of the social system that drive an adolescent's uptake, continuation and escalation of marijuana use over time using an approach grounded in rich theory from diverse disciplines. Specific Aim 3 is to use the system diagram to develop a quantitative simulation model of peer system effects on marijuana use and calibrate the model with available data, including the empirical literature. Upon completion of this award, the candidate will become a productive investigator who has the necessary skills to conduct innovative and compelling interdisciplinary research focused on the etiology of drug use in adolescents. She will understand how social context, specifically the dynamic nature of adolescent romantic and non-romantic peer relationships, affects marijuana use. Model building may help identify feedback loops in the peer system that perpetuates disparities in health and social consequences. Findings from this work may identify leverage points in the system that may be novel, multi-disciplinary and ideally more modifiable than previously identified prevention targets."
"9467619","Project Summary Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious mental illness that confers the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. Current treatments are inadequate and no pharmacologic agents have proven effective. A better understanding of the development and pathophysiology of AN is greatly needed. We propose a longitudinal, multimodal MRI study of reward and habit circuits in youth (ages 14-18) with AN, compared with age-matched healthy controls (HC), followed over two years. We focus on adolescence because this is a critical, yet understudied, period in AN. Pathological dieting typically emerges during adolescence, and the course of AN is often determined during this period with approximately half of teens showing full recovery, whereas the rest endure persistent illness. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms by which some teens develop persistent AN, while others remit, is critical to developing the most effective interventions. Our study will examine neural mechanisms guiding food choice and neural connectivity in mesolimbic and habit-related circuits among youth with AN who continue with illness compared with those who remit, and compared with HC. We will examine these neural circuits at baseline and study their developmental trajectories. Our Food Choice Task captures restrictive intake, a core behavioral disturbance in AN, and therefore we can directly examine the link between brain activity and eating behavior. Using longitudinal, multimodal MRI at 3- time points, we will first test whether the function and connectivity of mesolimbic reward and dorsal habit circuits predict the longer-term course of AN. Second, we will examine longitudinal changes within these two neural circuits of interest. We predict that at baseline, restrictive food choice in youth with AN will be mediated by mesolimbic reward circuitry; however, at year-2 follow-up, in teens for whom the disorder persists, restrictive food choice will be mediated by dorsal striatal habit circuitry. The study will (i) chart the developmental trajectories of reward and habit circuits in youth with AN; (ii) advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which AN persists to chronicity, and (iii) help develop targets for novel therapeutic strategies."
"9462149","Project Summary Vertebrate vision and olfaction depend on cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels. These channels transduce chemical signals to electrical signals in photoreceptors and olfactory receptor cells. Mutations in CNG channel genes are associated with visual disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa and achromatopsia. CNG channels exhibit interesting and physiologically important properties; for example, their activities are controlled by intracellular cyclic nucleotides instead of transmembrane voltage, they conduct Na+ and Ca2+ but are also blocked by external Ca2+, their activation gate is located in the ion selectivity filter rather than the cytoplasmic end of the ion conduction pathway. Despite extensive functional studies, to date, there is no high-resolution structure of a full-length CNG channel, limiting our understanding of CNG channel mechanisms and functions. In preliminary studies, we have solved a 3.5 Å-resolution single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a full-length CNG channel from C. elegans, named TAX-4, in the cGMP-bound open state. This structure provides significant insights into CNG channel gating, ion permeation and channelopathy. We will build on this breakthrough and pursue the following studies: (1) We will obtain an unliganded, closed state TAX-4 structure. (2) Our new structure reveals an interface between a cGMP-controlled cytoplasmic gating ring and the transmembrane domain of the channel. We will study the importance and mechanistic contribution of this interface to TAX-4 gating by cGMP. We will also generate a mutant channel that can still bind cGMP but is fully closed, and solve the structure of this cGMP-bound closed channel, which will shed significant light on the mechanisms and structural changes involved in ligand gating. (3) Our newly obtained structure allows us to map the 3-D locations of many single amino acid missense mutations that cause retinitis pigmentosa and achromatopsia. We will select a set of mutations that we suspect may affect cGMP gating but not cGMP binding and examine the functional properties of the corresponding mutant channels, including membrane trafficking and gating by cGMP. As in aim 2, we will also select a mutant channel that can still bind cGMP but is fully closed, and solve the structure of this cGMP-bound closed channel, illustrating how a disease-causing mutation changes channel structure. (4) Our structure reveals that the ion selectivity filter is lined by the carboxylate side chains of a glutamate residue and three rings of backbone carbonyls. We will study the functional and structural impact of mutating this glutamate. We will also solve the structure of WT and mutant TAX-4 in Ca2+-containing solutions, providing insights to where and how Ca2+ binds in the selectivity filter. These studies will greatly enhance our knowledge on the mechanisms of CNG channel ion permeation, gating and channelopathy, and provide a framework for understanding cyclic nucleotide modulation of related channels, such as hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channels."

Building upon the established successes of Einstein's Diabetes Research and Training Center (DRTC) and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai's Diabetes and Obesity Metabolism Institute (DOMI), the ES-DRC serves as a nexus to i) enhance diabetes research, education and training; ii) attract, mentor and retain research investigators; iii) provide state- of-the-art Core services to maximize research productivity; iv) foster interdisciplinary collaborations locally and regionally, and v) promote the translation of scientific findings from the bench to the bedside and ultimately the community, especially in underserved and minority populations. To accomplish these goals, we reorganized the ES-DRC into five cutting-edge biomedical cores spanning the basic, pre-clinical, and clinical research `translational' divide: 1) Animal Physiology; 2) Stable Isotope & Metabolomics; 3) Human Islet & Adenovirus; 4) Biomarker & Analytical Research; and 5) Translational Research Cores. At the molecular, cellular, tissue, animal based integrated physiology levels, we provide the infrastructure to investigate the basic mechanisms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. These investigations are translated into human based clinical investigation, population based studies that include large cohort studies of under-represented minorities, women and HIV infected individuals. To attain these goals, we use the support of an Administrative Core for which its personnel have overall responsibility for management, integration and promotion of research and training among Einstein, Mount Sinai and our affiliated institutional Center members. This Core also provides support for our highly successful Pilot & Feasibility Study Program, Enrichment activities and coordination between the Einstein and Mount Sinai Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). This infrastructure already allowed us to establish several new innovative programs including a new microgrant initiative, and establishment of a laboratory information management system (LMIS) for ordering, billing, monitoring experimental progress, data acquisition, data analyses and data distribution to investigators. In parallel, the ES-DRC research cores provide robust cutting-edge methodologies and equipment necessary to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of diabetes in model organisms and in human-based studies that can be translated to clinical care."
"9463798","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebrovascular accumulation of the amyloid ß-protein (Aß), a condition known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is an important driver of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) and is a common comorbidity of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). CAA can promote VCID through a number of mechanisms including chronic inflammation, hypoperfusion and ischemia, loss of vessel wall integrity and hemorrhage. In addition to its prevalence in AD, several related familial CAA disorders result from specific mutations that reside within the Aß peptide sequence of the Aß precursor protein including the Dutch-type (E22Q) and Iowa-type (D23N) mutations. Despite the highly fibrillogenic nature of Dutch mutant and Iowa mutant Aß peptides, fibrillar Aß is restricted to te cerebral vasculature in these familial disorders. Recent evidence suggests the cerebral vascular amyloid is distinct from parenchymal plaque amyloid. However, there is a poor understanding as to why cerebral vascular amyloid forms and its unique structural features that promotes distinct pathological consequences leading to VCID. Thus, the focus of this proposal is to fill this critica void in knowledge. Accordingly, the overall hypothesis of this proposal is that fibrillar amyloid i cerebral blood vessels possesses distinct structural features compared to parenchymal fibrillar amyloid and unique anti-parallel structures, enhanced by CAA mutations, drives the cerebral vascular specific deposition of amyloid in brain.  To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims. First, we will determine the structure, assembly and membrane interactions of wild-type and the Dutch and Iowa CAA mutants of Aß in solution and model membrane systems that drive their compartmental deposition. Second, we will determine how familial CAA variants of Aß chronologically influence the structural features and assembly of wild-type Aß in the brains of transgenic mice. Third, we will isolate parenchymal plaque amyloid and cerebral vascular amyloid from post mortem brain tissue of AD cases, sporadic CAA cases and familial CAA cases and investigate their ability to promote assembly of wild-type and CAA mutant Aß peptides. These important studies will reveal the distinct structural signatures of cerebral vascular and parenchymal plaque amyloid deposits in human disease.  Presently, there are no reliable biomarkers or effective therapies specifically for CAA and VCID. These deficiencies are complicated by our lack of understanding of the unique structural attributes of cerebral vascular amyloid and its early-stage oligomeric precursors, and their distinctive features and processes compared to parenchymal plaque amyloid. The present proposal will seek to fill this critical void in our knowledge and will advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of CAA and provide the basis for the future development of novel therapeutic interventions and diagnostic markers for CAA and VCID."
"9463459","Translational Biomarker Core (TBC) Abstract The TBC is a key component of the exposure biology program of the Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) described in the Strategic Vision. The Core measures biomarkers of exposure and effect, disease onset and progression, and therapeutic response for diseases of environmental etiology. The TBC employs rigorous mass spectrometry (MS)-based methodology to identify biomarkers in cell-culture based models, in animal models and in population and patient cohorts that may be identified in the Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core. Analytes measured are small biomolecules, proteins, as well as targeted and untargeted metabolomes as reporters of the exposome. The TBC recognizes that the need to relate phenotypic changes in biomarkers with either changes in the transcriptome or with genetic variants and this is achieved by data integration performed by the CEET Informatics Core. The integration of genomic, proteomic and metabolomics biomarkers offers the promise to deliver new diagnostic and prognostic indicators that can be used for PREcision Environmental Medicine (PREEM) on an individual basis. The TBC is equipped with state-of-the art liquid chromatography-MS, ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-MS and UPLC- high resolution MS instrumentation. Many assays use stable-isotope dilution LC-MS as the gold standard for precision and accuracy and many of the assays cannot be performed elsewhere in the world. The goals of the Core are to (i) analyze biomarkers of exposure and effect in biofluids from model systems and in biofluids in population cohorts and patients; (ii) to provide services in discovery and targeted proteomics and metabolomics; (iii) to develop new assays for CEET investigators and translate these assays into routine Core services for other CEET investigators; and (iv) to provide training to end-users who wish to conduct their own analysis."
"9548029","ABSTRACT Kenya has one of the largest HIV epidemics in the world with more than 1.5 million people living with the disease. Research on HIV in Kenya have contributed significantly to the management, treatment, and prevention of HIV in the country as well to the development of international guidelines worldwide. Aga Khan University East Africa (AKU) is a growing medical and nursing academic institution with campuses in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. It initiated the first clinical infectious diseases (ID) and cardiology fellowships for medical doctors in East Africa and is developing research expertise in HIV and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). However, in order to create a high quality HIV research environment, AKU needs to strengthen its research administration and management infrastructure. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) understand the needs and gaps in research administration and management at AKU by conducting an on-the-ground assessment of the site; 2) improve the knowledge and skills of AKU research administrators and grant managers by implementing in-person training workshops in Nairobi, Kenya and facilitating site visits by AKU trainees to the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle, USA; and 3) strengthen the ability of AKU research administrator and grant managers to successfully submit NIH, CDC, and other donor-funded grants by providing ongoing mentorship and online coursework. UW experts in research administration and grant and financial management will implement the objectives of the proposed infrastructure development training program, which will be led by Dr. Michael Chung, an Associate Professor of Global Health at UW, and Dr. William Macharia, the Associate Dean of Research at AKU. The program will be facilitated by Dr. Chung?s Treatment, Research, and Expert Education (TREE) program in the UW Department of Global Health (DGH). TREE has extensive experience building capacity in Kenyan institutions, and has offices in Seattle at the UW and in Nairobi at AKU, where Dr. Chung is also Chair of the Department of Medicine. Dr. Chung, the Program Director, and Dr. Macharia, the Co- Director, will establish a training program that will educate 12 administrators and managers at AKU in a series of 7 workshops conducted in Kenya over 3 years, facilitate visits to the UW in Seattle by 10 AKU trainees, and mentor a core group of trainees who are needed to successfully submit and administer grants from AKU. Dozens of trainees in East Africa will also be able to take online financial management courses provided by UW program faculty. By the end of the infrastructure development training program, research administrators and grant managers at AKU will be able to successfully submit and manage National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other donor-funded grants, and will significantly expand the number of HIV grant applications submitted by AKU faculty and amount of grant funding awarded to the institution."
"9396628","It is common practice to admit patients to an intensive care unit (ICU) after major surgery for close  post-operative monitoring. However it is unclear whether using the ICU for post-operative monitoring  actually improves outcomes. In fact, admission to an ICU following major surgery represents an  intervention associated with possible benefits (early detection and management of potentially life  5 threatening complications) but also with risks and drawbacks (e.g. exposure to multi-drug resistant  organisms, iatrogenic injuries from invasive monitoring, sleep deprivation and increased risk of  delirium). Additionally, admissions to the ICU have a significant impact on healthcare expenses. ICU  admissions represent about 13% of hospital costs, 4.2% of national health expenditures, and 0.56% of  gross domestic product. 10 Currently, there are no standard criteria for admission to the ICU after major surgical procedures, and  about one third of patients undergoing major surgery are either over-triaged to the ICU or under-  triaged to a regular ward. Over-triage to the ICU may result in unwanted adverse events and harm to  patients, as well as significantly adding to the cost of health care. Under-triage to a lower level of care  might lead to worse outcomes through failing to recognize or adequately manage treatable problems. 15 Our overarching research aim is to develop objective criteria for ICU admission after major surgical procedures to enhance post-operative triage to the appropriate level of care.  The goal of this pilot proposal is the initial identification of peri-operative conditions, measurable  parameters, that could be used to improve post-operative triage. Additionally, we will also investigate  whether objective criteria or subjective clinical judgment (the current standard of care) have the 20 closest correlation with events mandating ICU admission.  We will retrospectively identify patients that do require a post-operative ICU admission as those for  which certain key events have been recorded during the immediate post-operative course (e.g.  prolonged endo-tracheal intubation or re-intubation, hemodynamic instability requiring vasopressors,  respiratory or circulatory arrest). We will then use three complementary strategies to identify criteria for 25 post-operative triage to the ICU.  ? A retrospective analysis will identify what peri-operative conditions or risk scores correlate with  key events requiring ICU management.  ? A prospective pilot study of 100 patients will clarify whether subjective clinical assessments or  objective parameters and risk scores have the closest correlation with key events requiring ICU 30 management.  ? An expert panel will establish consensus criteria for postoperative ICU admission based on  their own expertise, as well as on the data collected during our study.  A subsequent Investigator-Initiated Research proposal will assess how those criteria can be  implemented in standardized guidelines or decision-making tools to enhance post-operative triage, 35 improve patient safety, and decrease costs of healthcare delivery. Our ultimate goal is to evaluate  current triage methods and implement standardized decision making processes to improve patient  safety and decrease costs related to inappropriate utilization of the ICU."
"9442617","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Veterans returning from the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan exhibit high rates of comorbid mTBI/PTSD. Given the comorbidity and neuropsychiatric symptom overlap of these disorders, it can be difficult to determine whether problems and disruptions in functioning are due to mTBI, PTSD, or both. Hence, it is challenging for providers to know how to prioritize these patients' clinical issues and how to effectively treat them. Currently, there are no evidence-based treatments for comorbid mTBI/PTSD. Further, it is unclear to what extent existing treatments for each disorder can be adherently and effectively implemented for the other. As such, most current treatment recommendations suggest a holistic or integrated approach to treatment for comorbid mTBI/PTSD targeting symptoms and functionality rather than underlying etiology. We are proposing a treatment for comorbid mTBI and PTSD that directly targets daily functioning and quality of life. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Cognitively Augmented Behavioral Activation (CABA), a new hybrid treatment for veterans diagnosed with comorbid mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study's specific goals are to determine whether: 1) CABA reduces PTSD symptoms in veterans with mTBI/PTSD, 2) CABA reduces cognitive-related functional impairment in veterans with mTBI/PTSD, 3) CABA results in improvements in depression symptoms, cognitive functioning, and quality of life in veterans with mTBI/PTSD; and 4) CABA is an acceptable treatment for veterans with mTBI/PTSD. The overall goal is to develop an evidence-based manualized treatment for comorbid mTBI/PTSD that can be readily implemented in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) treatment settings. The study design makes use of the convergent availability of resources at the two participating Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMCs) in Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington to conduct a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of CABA. The study will recruit a total of 192 OEF/OIF veterans, 96 participants at each site, enrolled at participating VAMCs who are diagnosed with both mTBI and PTSD. Inclusion criteria will be 1) OIF/OEF era Veterans enrolled at one of the participating VA sites who are able to provide informed consent, 2) Diagnosis of PTSD based on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (Blake et al., 1990), 3) Positive screen on the Structured Interview for Collecting Head Trauma Event Characteristics as outlined by the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Concussion/mTBI and positively endorsed any of the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) cognitive symptoms items (items 13-17), 4) English speaking, able to travel to the primary care clinics weekly for 10 sessions and for the follow-up assessments, and willing to refrain from the initiation of additiona mental health treatment during the first 3 1/2 months of the active phase of treatment if they are assigned to the CABA condition, and 5) Willingness to participate in audio-recorded sessions. Exclusion criteria will be 1) Current substance dependence disorder with less than 30 days abstinence, 2) Current Bipolar or psychotic disorder, 3) Active suicidal intent indicating significant clinical risk, 4) Initiated psychotropic medication within 6 weeks prior to the first assessment; and 4) Auditory or visual impairments that would prevent ability to participate in the cognitive rehabilitation group or benefit from compensatory strategies. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either the CABA or Treatment as Usual (TAU) group. Participants in the CABA group will receive the CABA intervention during the first 14 weeks of their participation in the study, whereas TAU participants will continue to receive TAU (usual care in a PTSD specialty treatment clinic, but no CABA) during their participation in the study. Both groups will undergo evaluations at baseline, 7 weeks (mid-treatment), 14 weeks (post-treatment), and 39 weeks (6 month follow- up). During their study participation, all participants will continue to receive their usual medical care."
"9461072","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this Program is to develop a fundamental physical and chemical understanding of the mechanisms by which RNA molecules and their complexes with proteins carry out their biological functions. During the next five years,  several different systems that are involved in the processes of protein synthesis by ribosomes, catalysis by RNA enzymes, and ribo-switches will be studied. While a major technique to be used will be single crystal X-ray diffraction, these structural studies will be integrated with genetic, biochemical, chemical and computational approaches. A major goal will be to capture the structures of these macromolecular machines at each step of the various processes they carry out, enabling the production of movies showing the molecular motions involved in these mechanisms. Of special interest are the motions that occur in the course of protein synthesis as the ribosome proceeds through its elongation cycle, the mechanisms of riboswitches and other RNAs using allosteric mechanisms, the mechanisms of catalysis by various ribozymes. Also of interest will be the ways in which the structures and properties of RNA molecules can be utilized to carry out various biological functions that are often analogous to those performed by proteins."
"9491913","Project Summary/Abstract This is an NIMH Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant Program (R21) proposal entitled, ?Characterization of Variability in Motivation and Reward in Psychosis.? Motivational deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia and related disorders and are associated with poor community outcomes and reduced treatment adherence and efficacy during behavioral interventions such as cognitive remediation. Motivation and reward are not unitary constructs but are comprised of measurable and separable domains, as delineated in the RDoC Positive Valence Systems Domain, which may be differentially associated with illness traits, outcomes, and treatment response. However, characterization of dysfunction across the PVS domain using multiple measures across units of analysis has not been undertaken in psychosis, and whether profiles of deficits emerge and are differentially associated with clinical and community functioning or predictive of treatment outcomes has not yet been tested. In the present proposal we aim to measure multiple constructs across the PVS Domain using a multivariate battery across units of analysis in a cross-diagnostic sample of patients with psychosis (n=200) and healthy controls (n=50), and examine the structure of this domain using principal components analysis. We will use emergent factors to then a) examine associations between factors and clinical, cognitive, and community functioning measures, and with motivated behaviors using validation measures; and b) identify groups of patients who share similar PVS factor profiles using cluster analysis. Similar approaches have successfully uncovered meaningful groupings previously obscured by group-level means comparisons (5, 8) using such techniques, permitting the examination of profiles of patients along constructs of interest map more closely to outcomes and neurobiological correlates than do heterogeneous groupings like diagnosis (6,7). Findings from this project will position us to examine biological mechanisms that underpin these factors (3), and ? critically ? guide treatment efforts toward targeting these specific processes in our ongoing program of research. The PI is an early stage investigator and K23 Awardee with a career focus on characterization of the nature and course of multidimensional symptom domains such as cognition and PVS symptoms across the psychosis spectrum, and treatments such as cognitive remediation to target these deficits."
"9461619","SUMMARY: PROJECT 1 Despite its prevalence and enormous cost to society, current treatments for schizophrenia (SZ) are not effective in all individuals and do little to treat the disabling cognitive and negative symptoms. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify new molecular pathways to target in developing new compounds and tools for earlier diagnosis and treatment of SZ. Our Center is focused on testing the hypothesis that immune molecules may constitute such a target pathway. Immune genes located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have been reliability identified in recent genome-wide association studies, while maternal infections are among the best-established environmental risk factors for the illness. The development of mouse and non-human primate (NHP) models of maternal infection has also strengthened the link between maternal immune activation (MIA) and SZ because these models recapitulate many SZ related phenotypes at both the neurobiological and behavioral levels. Although our work is providing increasingly compelling validation for their efficacy in mimicking core phenotypes of SZ, little is known about how MIA alters brain development after birth to cause SZ-related phenotypes in offspring. This project will determine how and when MIA alters neural connectivity during postnatal development and whether those changes depend on MIA-induced changes in MHCI levels in the brains of offspring. To accomplish these objectives, this project will undertake three specific aims to determine: 1) if MIA alters synapse density and type in the brains of offspring of the mouse and NHP models throughout postnatal development and in postmortem brain tissue from individuals with SZ using approaches that include an innovative technique called array tomography; 2) if MIA alters microglial activation and levels of immune molecules, including MHCI, in the brains of offspring in both animal models throughout development as well as in postmortem brain tissue from individuals with SZ; 3) if changes in immune molecules in the brains of offspring from the mouse model mediate the effects of MIA by assessing whether restoring levels of neuronal MHCI back to normal prevents MIA-induced changes in synaptic connectivity and SZ-like behaviors in offspring. By accomplishing these aims, Project 1 will directly address the central hypothesis of the Center in a mechanistic manner. Moreover, performing these experiments across scales will identify which MIA-induced changes in synaptic connectivity are relevant to human disease through their conservation in the NHP model. Results from this project are essential to the success of the other projects in the Center in providing a phenotypic read-out for changes in transcriptional networks (Project 2) and in structural and functional connectivity (Project 3), as well as critical information about whether microglial activation mediates changes in neural inflammation (Project 4) in MIA models and humans with SZ. If successful, results from this project will identify novel targets for developing more effective diagnostic tools and therapies for SZ and other psychiatric illnesses with a neural-immune basis."

"9605927","Optimal calcium imaging with shaped excitation Understanding information flow in the brain is dependent on simultaneously recording the activity of large neuronal populations. It seems impossible to interrogate neurons serially, and still image large populations of neurons with high temporal resolution and high signal to noise. This is linked to the inverse relationship between volume scanned, and the signal collected per voxel, at fixed spatial and temporal resolution. However, this is not a hard limit. The goal of most functional imaging is to recover and assign activity signals from neurons; here we demonstrate that nearly all past approaches have dramatically oversampled spatially to create human-interpretable images. This is not necessary ? once the spatial footprints of the observed neurons are known, constrained non-negative matrix factorization methods can extract highly accurate temporal activity signals from very low spatial resolution movies. Reducing the number of samples required in imaging allows us to significantly speed up acquisition. In this proposal we introduce a new fast computational imaging method, leveraging modern computational demixing methods with simple optical hardware to increase imaging speeds by an order of magnitude. We proposed to use modern spatial light modulator systems to provide a flexible and powerful tool for optically implementing our proposed spatial downsampling approach, while taking better advantage of laser power and avoiding standard problems with diffraction- limited imaging caused by limited dwell times on the sample. The resulting combined hardware- software solution will be inexpensive, easy to implement and maintain, and widely applicable in the hundreds of labs currently using multi-photon imaging methods. Thus, the proposed approach will enable a critical leap towards achieving the goals of the BRAIN initiative."
"9438221","ABSTRACT The overarching goal of the Summer Research Internship Program (SRIP) is to exploit the rich research community at the University of Virginia (UVA) to expose underrepresented undergraduate and medical students to the excitement, capabilities, rigors, and breadth of opportunities for careers in biomedical research. From its inception, the major goals of this NHLBI-supported program have been (1) to expose undergraduate students to the state-of-the-art in cardiovascular, pulmonary and hematological research; (2) to familiarize the students with the opportunities that exist for careers in research; (3) to encourage and facilitate them pursuing a career in research; and (4) to kindle and nurture a passion for doing research that truly makes a difference and leaves a mark on mankind. This application seeks support to continue this successful program, through which ten (10) undergraduate and/or post-baccalaureate students and five (5) rising second-year medical students participate in the SRIP each year. The ten-week program has three educational components. The first and most important is an immersive, hand-on research experience mentored by of one of our 56 program faculty and focused in the mission areas of the NHLBI. Second, the trainees participate in a weekly 1-hour workshop focused on developing and refining scientific communication skills appropriate for various contexts and audiences. Finally, the trainees attend a professional development luncheon series that provides instruction in successful admission to graduate and medical school, panel discussions of career options led by current students, and opportunities to interact with and learn from basic scientists, translational researchers and physician scientists. These presentations are intertwined with practical experiences focused on positioning both the undergraduate and medical student trainees for success at the next stages of their career. To date, more than 50% of the undergraduate SRIP alumni have successfully made the transition in graduate and/or medical school. Through strong mentorship, hands-on research, innovative educational initiatives, and exposure to a wide range of research and clinical care experiences, trainees in the SRIP are uniquely prepared to pursue advanced training with the ultimate goal of becoming members of a diverse biomedical workforce. !"

"9405046","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sindbis virus (SINV), the prototype alphavirus, causes encephalomyelitis in mice and provides a model for studying the pathogenesis of arboviral encephalomyelitis. Our previous studies with SINV have shown that survival is dependent on host and viral factors that include age and genetic background, virulence of the virus and the host immune response. Neuroadapted SINV (NSV) is virulent for adult C57BL/6 (B6) mice and is a model for virus-induced fatal encephalomyelitis in mature animals. NSV-infected mice develop weakness that progresses to paralysis and death within 7-10 days. Virus clearance from the brain and spinal cord begins 5-6 days after infection and is coincident with the onset of neurological disease. Although the antiviral immune response is essential for virus clearance, it can also contribute to fatal disease. We have shown that survival after NSV infection is improved in T cell-deficient mice and in mice with pharmacologic inhibition of the inflammatory response. Therefore, virus-specific immune cells entering the central nervous system (CNS) contribute to neuronal damage, but the mechanisms and immune factors that cause neuronal death during fatal encephalomyelitis are not known. In preliminary studies, we have determined that deficiency of the important regulatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 accelerates the onset of fatal NSV-induced paralytic disease. Accelerated disease is associated with an early increase in the CNS of CD4+ T cells producing IL-17 (Th17 cells) and a delay in virus clearance. Determination of the role of Th17 cells in NSV-induced immunopathology and identification of the mechanism(s) by which they influence outcome is important for developing interventions and for identifying host determinants of susceptibility to severe disease. The specific aims of the proposal are: (1) Determine whether Th17 cells entering the CNS during fatal viral encephalomyelitis have or evolve a pathogenic phenotype. Th17 cells in IL-10-/- and wild type (WT) B6 mice will be characterized for expression of transcription factors, cytokines and surface receptors using multicolor flow cytometry. The CNS environment for Th17 cells will be assessed using qRT-PCR and immunoassays. The transcriptome of virus- induced CNS Th17 cells will be determined. (2) Determine whether Th17 cells are responsible for virus- induced immunopathologic disease. Th17 cells and outcome will be studied in mice deficient in factors required for Th1 and Th17 differentiation, genetically resistant BALB/c mice, mice infected with an avirulent strain of SINV and mice rescued from fatal encephalitis by antiviral antibody. (3) Determine the mechanism of CD4+ T cell-mediated neuronal damage and test candidate therapeutics. Effectors will be identified using genetically deficient mice, neutralizing antibodies, immunohistochemistry and CNS slice cultures followed by identification of therapies that prevent immunopathologic CNS damage. (4) Determine the mechanism for delayed virus clearance. Production of IFN-? and E2 antibody in the CNS and the effect of IL-17 and other Th17 effector molecules on the antiviral effects of IFN-? and anti-E2 antibody will be measured."
"9541389","Project Summary Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are the final neural output controlling the secretion of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary and ovarian steroid hormones (estradiol and progesterone) in female mammals. In turn, GnRH secretion is regulated by gonadal steroid hormones via a feedback mechanisms. Throughout the estrous cycle across species, low levels of estradiol inhibit GnRH secretion via negative steroid hormone feedback. High levels of estradiol during the late follicular phase result in positive feedback, leading to the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge. Finally, progesterone, plays an important role in negative feedback during the luteal phase of the cycle. GnRH neurons do not directly respond to gonadal steroid hormone feedback, either negative or positive, as they do not contain the appropriate steroid receptors. It is therefore hypothesized that GnRH neurons rely on an afferent neuronal network to convey this influence. Recent evidence suggests that Kisspeptin, Neurokinin B and Dynorphin (KNDy) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus play a pivotal role in conveying the feedback effects of gonadal steroid hormones on GnRH secretion during the estrous cycle. The long-term goal of this project is to further understand the mechanisms by which gonadal steroid hormones regulate KNDy neurons using female sheep as the animal model. In the first aim I will use whole tissue clearing approaches and light sheet microscopy to test the hypothesis that specific subpopulations of KNDy neurons are involved in regulating the negative and positive feedback influences of ovarian steroids on pulsatile and surge modes of GnRH/LH secretion, respectively. The second aim will test the hypothesis that KNDy neurons are heterogeneous in their response to gonadal steroids using a sensitive in situ hybridization technique, i.e. RNAscope, that allows for simultaneous visualization and analysis of multiple mRNA transcripts in KNDy neurons. Together, these studies will provide a greater level of knowledge of neuroendocrine substrates responsible for control of reproduction, and may reveal new targets for future therapeutic intervention for treatment of reproductive disorders. Moreover, these studies will provide a unique training experience that will contribute towards my goal to become an independent scientist."
"9684668","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Child maltreatment (CM) constitutes a serious public health problem in the United States1 and is known to compromise children's developing self-regulation skills and amplify risk for substance use and other regulatory disorders. Parents are implicated in more than 80% of CM cases involving physical abuse and neglect and thus represent critical targets of intervention. Research on the physiological response of CM parents during parenting suggests that parenting interventions may be less effective with this population2 because they fail to affect the neurobehavioral markers of dysregulation that drive harsh, aversive parenting. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), an intensive, 20-session parenting intervention, has been shown to improve the quality of CM parenting, improve positive parenting and child behavior, and produce declines in CM recidivism,3,4 though the mechanisms underlying its effects are little understood. On the basis of its live- coached, moment-by-moment scaffolding of positive parenting, we theorize that PCIT builds regulatory strength in parents, which then supports lasting behavior change. Use of bug-in-the-ear technology-unique to PCIT-provides parents with immediate access to therapist reinforcements for positive parenting that work to counter parents' heightened physiological arousal, inhibit (prepotent) aversive responding, and support greater use of (nondominant) positive parenting behavior. This study is designed to extend the collective work of our investigative team. It uses an experimental intervention design as a vehicle for testing a causal model of change in neurobehavioral indices of self-regulation. Specifically, we propose to conduct a randomized, controlled trial of PCIT for CM and test the effects of PCIT on self-regulation and behavior in CM parents and their elementary-school children. Two hundred-fifty (250) maltreating mothers and their children (age 5-8 years) will be drawn from Child Protective Services and randomized to the PCIT intervention or a control condition (services as usual). Key contextual risk factors will be assessed, including cumulative risk, parent mental health, and parent substance use. A multirater, multimethod approach to assessment will include neural (EEG/ERP), physiological (ECG), behavioral, and self-report measures of self-regulation in CM mothers and their children, as well as standard measures of parenting skills and children's behavior outcomes. Families will be followed at 6 months for self-regulation, parenting, and child behavioral outcomes, and to 1 year for CM recidivism. Findings from this proposed study are expected to have significant implications for optimizing CM parenting interventions by (a) determining the sensitivity of CM parent and child neurobehavioral self-regulation systems to intervention, and (b) identifying individual differences in self-regulation that mediate and moderate response to intervention and long-term maintenance of gains."
"9460371","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application focuses on the large number of children and adults who have diseases affecting the skeleton that are genetic, but not heritable. These disorders cause significant morbidity. Gorham-Stout Disease (GSD), Generalized Lymphatic Anomaly (GLA), bone cysts and tumors exemplify these diseases.  The co-investigators of this application have developed an approach for identifying genetic causes for these types of disorders by combining massively parallel sequencing of DNA or RNA - recovered from a patient's affected tissues and unaffected tissues - with computational algorithms that detect somatic mosaic mutations that are either solely in sequence from affected tissue or are enriched in sequence from affected tissue compared to unaffected tissue. This approach does not rely on prospectively obtaining freshly excised lesional tissue, since it works using frozen tissue and archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded pathologic samples. We validated our approach by employing it to discover that somatic mosaic activating mutations in PIK3CA are responsible for CLOVES syndrome. We now propose to extend our work to other genetic, non-hereditary conditions.  We have ascertained several well-characterized patient cohorts affected with diseases such as GSD, GLA, and bone tumors, and we have been collecting affected and unaffected tissue samples from these individuals. Our sample collection currently includes lesional tissue from 6 patients with GLA, 6 patients with GSD, 20 patients with giant cell tumors, 38 patients with chondroblastoma, 8 patients with chondromyxoid fibroma. In Aim One of this proposal, we will prepare bar-coded DNA and cDNA libraries from affected tissue and unaffected tissue, perform massively parallel sequencing, and use computational algorithms that have already enabled us to identify causative mutations in other disorders. We expect to successfully identify causative mutations in many of these new disorders.  Aim Two of our proposal builds upon our discovery that PIK3CA activating mutations cause patterning defects, malformations, and overgrowths when present in somatic mosaic form. We have a mouse in which we can conditionally activate the p.1047H>R mutation, which we have found in persons with CLOVES, KTS, FIL, and isolated lymphatic malformations, and we will soon have a mouse in which we can conditionally activate and then inactivate a different disease-causing Pik3ca mutation, p.420C>R. We will use these mice to understand the pathogeneses of malformations and overgrowths that occur in PIK3CA-associated disorders and to determine whether these problems can be prevented, delayed, or reversed.  Completion of these aims will link genes to phenotypes in patients whose diseases were previously impenetrable to genetic analyses and, for patients with PIK3CA-associated phenotypes, determine how lesions form and whether PIK3CA inhibition is a viable treatment strategy."
"9576120","PROJECT SUMMARY Invasive fungal infections are estimated to kill one and a half million people annually, with Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) infection resulting in almost half of all deaths due to fungal infection. Cn is rare in healthy individuals, suggesting the immune system is able to prevent disease. Yet the high mortality observed clinically suggests current antifungal drug treatments are inadequate in immunocompromised individuals. This paradox suggests we are missing critical components of the Cn-host interaction. Characterization of cryptococcal cells during infection has revealed that Cn produces a unique cell type - referred to as ?titan cells? - during infection that alter the host-pathogen interaction. These titan cells are produced in response to the host pulmonary environment and are 5-10x larger than typical-sized Cn cells. We demonstrated previously that titan cell production is critical for virulence and impacts dissemination to the CNS. We further showed titan cell formation alters the host response by reducing phagocytosis and stimulating a detrimental Th2-mediated response. The interaction between pathogens and their human hosts can be very complex, and the outcome depends on both host and pathogen responses. The host must sense pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and then produce an appropriate immune response to kill the pathogen. Conversely, the pathogen must sense and respond to the host environment to promote its own survival. This proposal aims to identify critical alterations involved in the genesis of titan cells and their progeny, as well as define how their unique cellular structure impacts the host immune response and thereby, pathogenesis. Titan cells have a number of unique characteristics, thus the focus of our proposed investigations are to determine how these traits influence: 1) pathogen adaptation/survival in the host, and 2) alteration of PAMPs recognized by the host immune response. Our previous studies showed titan cells undergo ploidy changes associated with their formation and replication, and lead us to hypothesize these changes are critical for adaptation and survival in the host environment. Therefore, our first aim is to define cell cycle regulation needed to generate titan cells and their progeny. In our second aim, we will test the hypothesis that alternations in the titan cell wall impact PAMP recognition by the host, with the third aim determining how this altered sensing generates the detrimental immune response observed in response to titan cells. These studies will ultimately coalesce into multi-faceted antimicrobial therapies that combine targeting patho- gen-specific processes to limit pathogen adaptation and modulation of the host immune response to maximize beneficial host responses to reduce disease."
"9509407","Metabolic Physiology Shared Resource: Project Summary/Abstract The Metabolic Physiology Shared Resource (MPSR) provides investigators with a platform for the design, execution, and interpretation of highly specialized procedures for conducting experiments in vivo. The MPSR facilitates research for investigators in species spanning from mouse to humans. Many of the basic tenets of experimental design are species-independent permitting resources and expertise to be pooled under the common MPSR umbrella. This philosophy alleviates experimental constraints by providing access to a variety of model systems and provides for seamless translation of basic experimental findings to humans. The MPSR uses a defined mechanism for the design and optimization of experimental protocols using an established Studio format. The Studio (i) brings together Vanderbilt scientists with specific expertise to review a proposal; (ii) identifies potential limitations on the front-end; and (iii) leads to the most efficient use of resources including animals and human volunteers. The MPSR makes complex in vivo experiments feasible by providing specialized animal surgical (e.g. catheter placement, bariatric surgery) and experimental (e.g. clamps, energy balance) services. Advancements in the present cycle have led to the development of bariatric surgery procedures and expansion of resources for energy balance measurements in animals that parallel procedures used in human studies conducted by the MPSR. The MPSR has also added a human clamp component. The addition of these vital services fills out the scope of services leading to comprehensive analyses of insulin action and energy balance from rodents to large animals to human subjects. MPSR services will channel into analytical, statistical, and bioinformatics services, thereby enhancing the utility of this resource."

"9691561","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid introduction of basic science discoveries into clinical fields requires close collaboration of basic and clinician scientists. Accomplishing this n otolaryngology requires a multidisciplinary approach to better define and treat the many disorders of the head and neck. Residency programs today offer limited research training for otolaryngologists, but few become independent investigators. In contrast, the basic sciences postdoctoral training offers little exposure to the clinical setting, making translational research difficult. The goal of this application is to provide research training in otolaryngology and its related sciences. Support is requested for in-depth training for 1) residents, 2) postdoctoral fellows, 3) predoctoral students and 4) short-term medical students. All trainees will receive an interactive basic research experience with ongoing exposure to and interaction of trainees in the clinical setting through conferences and courses. The pre- and postdoctoral trainees will have a 24-month block of training. Research training for MDs will begin in medical school with students doing short-term (3-month) projects and continue through the residency program with a 2-year block midway through the clinical training. One resident will be admitted each year into this research track. Early introduction and continued research involvement throughout the residency will increase our ability to attract academically oriented faculty members into the field, with backgrounds to become independent investigators. This cross-field exposure will enhance the experience for trainees and promote clinical and basic science interactions as a faculty. A major strength of the program is drawing members of the faculty from a wide variety of departments of the School of Medicine and across the UC campuses involved in otolaryngology related research. This will enhance collaborative efforts in related fields of hearing, balance, smell, taste, speech, language and head and neck cancer. All faculty members have primary or secondary appointments within the Department of Otolaryngology, creating an ideal environment for translational research between basic and clinician scientists. Through this multidisciplinary approach to research training for different levels of trainees from a variety of fields, recruitment and retention of a research-oriented academic faculty involved in research into disorders of the ears, nose and throat will be increased."
"9503433","Enhancing engagement with health care is the foundation for VHA's transformation to personalized, proactive, patient-driven care that optimizes health and well-being. Patient engagement is linked to better care experiences and better clinical outcomes at reduced costs: the ?triple aim? of healthcare systems. The science devoted to measurement must keep pace with new models of care. The ability to measure Veteran engagement is a critical component of patient-centered care. A self-report measure could be incorporated into patient-facing applications, inform personalized care plans and risk stratification, and facilitate research efforts. Extant measures do not meet VHA needs with respect to literacy levels, measurement sensitivity, or feasibility.  Our goal is to develop a Veteran-centered, precise, and predictive patient-report measure that quantifies the propensity to engage with health care. Our approach builds on a Veteran-centered construct definition and item pool derived through extensive pilot work. A multi-level stakeholder engagement strategy will optimize Veteran usability and correspondence with VHA strategic priorities. The use of calibrated item banks will enable flexible implementation for a range of treatment settings and Veteran populations.  The proposed aims of this project are to: 1) establish an item bank and corresponding short form that measures a Veteran's propensity to engage with health care; 2) assess concurrent validity and test-retest reliability of the measure; and 3) evaluate the predictive validity of the new measure against objective indicators of patient engagement. The item pool will be evaluated using a national survey of VHA primary care users who have been diagnosed with a mental health condition (depression and PTSD) or chronic medical condition (hypertension and diabetes), oversampling for women and racial minorities. Item Response Theory models will be used to calibrate items. Convergent validity with self-report correlates of patient engagement will provide preliminary validation. Predictive validity will be examined using global and condition-specific indicators of engagement from VA administrative data aggregated over the year following the survey.  The VHA population has a high burden of chronic illness. The treatment demands of complex chronic conditions can be overwhelming to patients and account for a disproportionate amount of health care costs. High value care is determined by how well services fit with Veteran needs, preferences, and opportunities to benefit from care. A measure of engagement can help tailor care to Veteran needs and identify individuals who require adjunctive intervention to achieve the most benefit from their care. This research will fill an important gap in population health management, not only by enhancing risk prediction, but by integrating Veteran perspectives through patient-report measures. This work will catalyze efforts to promote engagement with care by providing flexible and practical assessment tools."
"9458107","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proprotein convertase Site-1 protease (S1P) has emerged as a critical regulator of mammalian skeletal development. It is an indispensable component of the regulated intramembrane proteolysis systems that govern lipid metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Our studies implicate S1P as a mandatory component of the protein secretory apparatus that defines all connective tissues. We have studied the functions of S1P in a progressive set of S1P knock-out mouse models using Col2-Cre, Col2-CreER(T) and Osx-Cre mice. In addition to a lipid phenotype, studies on S1P ablation in chondroprogenitor cells (S1Pcko model) have demonstrated chondrodysplasia characterized by the specific endoplasmic reticulum (ER) entrapment of type IIB procollagen, poor cartilage matrix development, and loss of endochondral bone formation in mice. Our recent studies demonstrated that along with type IIB procollagen, chondrocytes are also unable to secrete Adamts3, the type II procollagen N-proteinase. We have discovered a well-conserved S1P consensus sequence in the C-terminus of Adamts3, which suggests mandatory C-terminal processing of Adamts3 by S1P. Post-natal S1P ablation in chondrocytes (using Col2-CreER(T)) demonstrated complete disruption of hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation. When we followed this observation by ablating S1P in prehypertrophic chondrocytes and osteoblasts using Osx-Cre mice, adolescent mice exhibited kyphosis and scoliosis coupled to chondrodysplasia and fragile long bones. These observations confirm the requirement of S1P to overall skeletal development and suggest potential cell-specific functions for S1P. Our mechanistic characterization of the S1Pcko model has demonstrated that lipid metabolism is down-regulated in S1Pcko chondrocytes. Disrupted ER membrane functions induced by changes in lipid composition may trap the type IIB procollagen in the ER. In light of these findings, in Specific Aim 1 we will investigate deviations in S1Pcko ER membrane lipid composition by mass spectrometry and analyze disrupted ER membrane functions by calcium imaging. In Specific Aim 2 we will investigate Adamts3 as a novel S1P substrate and analyze whether type IIB procollagen trafficking is regulated by a physical association with Adamts3. We will also study cartilage-specific ablation of Adamts3 in mice to analyze its role in cartilage development and maintenance. In Specific Aim 3, taking the lead from our previous knock-out models, we will characterize how disruptions in chondrocyte and osteoblast functions due to S1P ablation could lead to spine abnormalities in order to identify the biological trigger required for kyphosis and scoliosis development. This approach will allow investigation of multiple novel functions of S1P; additionally it will also provide novel insights into the regulation of protein secretory pathways and how their disruptions lead to the clinical phenotypes of chondrodysplasia and spine deformities."

"9672189","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neutral lipid pool of triglyceride (TG) in the heart, once thought to be a static, inactive depot for unused fat, has more recently been recognized to instead be a dynamic pool of esterified long chain fatty acid (LCFA), constantly turning over to provide LCFA as both a ligand for nuclear receptor activation of PPAR-a, with subsequent transcriptional activation of metabolic enzyme expression, and a significant fuel-source for mitochondrial ß-oxidation. The dysregulation of cardiac lipid dynamics is associated with eventual decline in ventricular function in both animal models and humans with obesity or insulin resistance. Linking altered cardiac TG dynamics to contractile performance therefore holds promise for both prognostic indications and identification of disease mechanisms as potential therapeutic targets. Our findings have elucidated both this dynamic nature of cardiac TG and the distinct kinetic components of TG enrichment rates from 13C-LCFA, as observed by dynamic-mode 13C NMR of the rodent heart. These kinetics correspond to either carrier-mediated uptake into the cardiomyocyte or turnover within the intracellular TG pool. Preliminary data demonstrate that two primary dietary LCFA abundant in plasma, palmitate and oleate, induce different TG turnover rates. The proposed research exploits these findings to investigate LCFA effects on intracellular lipid uptake, storage, and utilization dynamics in the intact rat and mouse heart that may determine formation of physiologically active and potentially lipotoxic acyl intermediates, ceramides and diacylglyceride (DAG). Lipid dynamics will be explored in models of altered TG synthase and lipase expression and during diet-induced metabolic stress. Importantly, dynamic-mode 13C NMR of rat hearts will assess lipid dynamics in response to a Western diet that is associated with lipotoxicity and potentially cardiomyopathic. We hypothesize that: 1) Within a physiological mixture of oleate and palmitate, the different affinities of each LCFA for TG synthesis and lipolysis, can be discerned by 13C NMR and these dynamics influence and define formation of DAG and different ceramides; 2) Either oleate-rich or palmitate-rich, normal and Western diets, mediate cardiac lipid dynamics, affecting activation of PPAR-a and acyl-derivative formation; 3) altered TG synthesis or lipolysis can be distinguished within the 13C kinetic profile of TG in the heart. Aim 1 determines competing affinities of oleate and palmitate for TG turnover and low-level acyl derivative formation in rat hearts. Aim 2 determines TG turnover, LCFA oxidation rates, PPAR-a activation, and acyl-derivatives in rat hearts during a Western diet, enriched with either high oleate or high palmitate, and potential effects on cardiac function. Aim 3 assesses specificity of dynamic-mode 13C NMR for TG synthase and lipase activity in transgenic mouse hearts. The overall objectives are to test the specificity of TG 13C-enrichment kinetics for TG esterification and de-esterification and to identify 13C-enrichment kinetics of the 13C enrichment rates that serve as signatures for altered lipid storage dynamics that produce lipotoxic ceramides and DAG during cardiomyopathic metabolic stress."
"9673997","PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this work is to elucidate the fundamental mechanism of exocytosis-endocytosis coupling at the central nerve terminals. Many types of synapses routinely transmit high-frequency action potentials through high-rate vesicle fusion at active zones. Fused synaptic vesicles and their associated proteins must be retrieved by endocytosis. In addition to regenerating new synaptic vesicles for future use, it is critical for balancing the surface area of the nerve terminals and maintaining intact ultrastructures. Despite decades of extensive research, the mechanism of endocytosis at chemical synapses is not fully addressed, particularly at physiological temperature. Strong evidence suggests that different modes of endocytosis take place in response to different synaptic activity, and endocytosis is a few orders of magnitude slower than vesicle fusion. However, recent morphological studies propose an ultrafast endocytosis that only occurs at a physiological temperature and replaces other forms of endocytosis. This is an attractive model because it efficiently minimizes the imbalance of surface area of nerve terminals during high-rate vesicle fusion. On the other hand, this model is built on the statistics of static images of fixed synapses, and sufficient functional data are required to test and characterize endocytosis at physiological temperature. The complete change of endocytosis pathways into a new, clathrin-independent endocytosis mode also raises many interesting new questions. Dynamin 1 is a large GTPase that is required for clathrin-mediate endocytosis at synapses, but its role in other forms of endocytosis such as bulk endocytosis and ultrafast endocytosis is less clear and controversial. In this proposal, we will address these questions by capacitance recordings from presynaptic terminals at physiological temperature. The time-resolve capacitance measurement (Cm) has high temporal resolution and sensitivity and thus is a suitable approach. First, we will characterize synaptic endocytosis by high time- resolution Cm at physiological temperature. We will use the calyx of Held, a fast glutamatergic central synapse in the auditory brainstem. We will overcome several technical limits during Cm recordings using new strategies and extract any fast endocytosis that may be present at physiological temperature. Different synaptic activities, including spontaneous single vesicle endocytosis, will be monitored. Secondly, we will use dynamin-1 conditional knockout mice as a valuable genetic model; its endocytosis properties at physiological temperate will be studied in response to various synaptic activities. This should provide significant insight into dynamin 1 function in vivo. This project will advance the field a step further and address several key questions recently raised by the rapid progress in this field. It will advance our knowledge on the kinetics and molecular mechanism of exocytosis-endocytosis coupling at central synapses under a condition similar to in vivo, and we expect a broad impact on cell biology of neurons and neuroscience."

"9452110","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although a large number of experiences produce transient memory only some of them form stable long-term memory. The value of the experience and internal state of the organism plays an important role in determining this transition from short-term to long-term memory. However, how external experience and the internal state of the organism interact at a molecular level to influence memory storage is largely unknown. The synthesis of new proteins is required to form stable long-term memory. CPEB, a family of RNA-binding proteins, regulate activity-dependent protein synthesis in the neuron. In Aplysia, a specific CPEB family member, ApCPEB, is required for the persistence of activity-dependent increase in synaptic strength beyond 24 hours. In Drosophila, a CPEB family member Orb2 is required to stabilize memory beyond 12 hours. In mice and human a CPEB family member CPEB3 has been linked to episodic memory formation. These observations suggest that CPEB family members play evolutionarily conserved role in the persistence of memory. The Drosophila Orb2 gene produces two distinct primary transcripts from two different transcription start sites, encoding the Orb2A and Orb2B proteins. Mutations that selectively inactivate Orb2A protein specifically destabilize long-term memory. We have found that the Orb2A mRNA has two forms; an intron containing unspliced form that does not code for Orb2A protein (Orb2A-np) and a spliced form that codes for full length Orb2A protein (Orb2A-pc). Surprisingly, the Orb2A-np mRNA is the prevalent isoform in the adult brain and exposure to cues that form associative long-term memory in flies, such as exposure of hungry flies to sucrose and odor increases the level of protein coding spliced Orb2A-pc transcript. The Drosophila orthologue of mammalian splicing regulator Nova binds Orb2A transcript and regulates the formation of Orb2A-pc mRNA. In this proposal we intend to dissect the behavioral cues and Nova-dependent molecular mechanism that regulate the level of protein coding Orb2A transcript. We also intend to address when and how long Orb2 proteins are required for persistence of memory. We hope that an understanding of the interaction of experiences and molecules that stabilize memory would be useful to understand addictions and post traumatic syndromes, in which a single experience forms extremely stable memory. Also, we hope to gain insight into the role of regulated mRNA processing in long-lasting memory."
"9456802","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major psychoses (SZ, SAD, BDP), when defined by clinical phenomenology alone, overlap extensively on neurobiological, biomarker, co-morbid, symptomatic, and genetic characteristics. Our field may benefit from transformational re-conceptualizations of disease seen in other areas of medicine when biological variables are considered in disease definitions and identification. This approach in psychiatry will depend on: (i) use of well- defined disease domains, (ii) large samples that capture clinical heterogeneity and support statistical approaches, and (iii) ability to acquire quantifiable laboratory measures t inform re-conceptualization of disease characteristics. The 5-site B-SNIP focus is psychosis, an ideal clinical phenotype for this purpose. B- SNIP1 recruited over 2500 volunteers and performed dense phenotyping across multiple levels of analysis (cognitive, psychophysiological, brain imaging, social and clinical). The overall data described a continuum of phenotypic alterations across the DSM psychosis diagnoses (BDP, SAD, SZ) with little evidence of diagnostic specificity. In an attempt to use these dense phenotypic characteristics to define biologically based subgroups, we re-grouped probands using biomarkers and a multistage multivariate analysis procedure. We identified 3 psychosis Biotypes based on core phenotypic features. Biotypes showed unique differences across external validators that were not used in the initial construction of the categories. B-SNIP2 will replicate and extend B- SNIP1 using enhanced proband number, biomarker panel, and sophistication of multivariate statistical approaches. We will accomplish our goals within the context of two specific aims. SA(1) Construct a 'Psychosis Biomarker Database' (PBD): Recruit 3000 new psychosis probands and 600 healthy volunteers and collect data including clinical, psychosocial, electrophysiological, ocular motor, imaging and blood biomarkers. Core biomarkers (used for Biotype definition) and external validators (used for verifying neurobiological distinctiveness of Biotypes) will be collected as specified. Genetic characteristics of the participants will be obtained in collaboratin with the Broad Institute. SA(2) Contrast and test taxometric approaches to categorizing psychosis: Evaluate the ability of different taxonomic structures to define psychosis subgroups, based on data in the PBD: (i) DSM, (ii) B-SNIP2 biotypes based on clinical variables, (iii) B-SNIP1 Biotypes, (iv) B-SNIP2-generated biotypes based on biomarkers, and (v) B-SNIP2 biotypes based on both clinical variables and biomarkers. Beginning with traditional DSM diagnostic criteria as the taxonomy and testing (i)-(v) we will use linear, quadratic and nonparametric discriminant function analysis applied to external biomarker validators to examine the association between the traditional diagnostic system and the biologically- derived classification (imaging, psychosocial and genetic external validators). We will be able to determine the strongest taxonomic approach based on biological characteristics. We seek a rational classification of psychotic disorders that will be successful in identifying novel disease targets and treatments approaches."
"9636187","Abstract This proposal is largely motivated by our involvement with the Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) which is an on-going large scale human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cluster randomized prevention trial conducted in 30 communities across Botswana. As in most HIV prevention studies, incomplete data on HIV status and nonresponse to queries about sexual behavior is an important challenge the study currently faces, with data likely missing not at random and in complex patterns across individuals. Recognizing that existing statistical methods for missing data are largely ill-suited to fully address this important problem in HIV research, we propose to develop the next generation of missing data methods going well beyond current theory of identification and inference. Specifically, we propose (1) to develop a unified theory of identification bringing together recent developments in the theory of identification based on causal graphs with recent identification results from the statistics literature. This will allow us to establish conditions under which in complex missing data settings as in the BCPP, one can untangle features of the underlying population which may be of scientific interest from features of the non-response process not necessarily of scientific interest;(2) to build on (1) to develop corresponding inverse-probability-weighted and doubly robust methods for statistical inference in the BCPP where data are likely to be missing not at random and in complex patterns; (3) to develop novel semiparametric imputation methods that solely rely on assumptions encoded in the nonresponse process, thus allowing the complete data distribution in the BCPP to remain unscathed by the imputation process; (4) to develop user-friendly software to facilitate widespread use of the methods developed in Aims 1-3, and to apply and demonstrate their good performance in extensive simulation studies as well as in answering scientific queries of primary interest in the BCPP."
"9470918","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory is an essential cognitive function central to virtually all behaviors. Despite the fact that we know which brain areas and which neuromodulators are involved in working memory, we know very little about which neurons need to be activated when to enable working memory. This gap in our knowledge arose because of the technical difficulty in manipulating and monitoring neural activity in genetically- and anatomically- defined cell-types with sufficiently high temporal resolution. In order to overcome this challenge and elucidate some of the causal neural dynamics for working memory, we propose to combine multiple synergistic approaches, including a rat optogenetic model that we have previously developed to target dopaminergic neurons, in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and fluorescence-based monitoring of neural activity in freely behaving animals (with gCaMP6). In Aim 1, we will optogenetically inhibit several cortical and striatal circuits eiter during the updating, maintenance, or readout of working memory to determine which aspect of working memory each circuit supports. In Aims 2, we will monitor neural activity in dopaminergic neurons using gCaMP6 to determine how dopaminergic dynamics correlate with working memory performance. In Aim 3, we will generate different patterns of dopaminergic stimulation (e.g. tonic vs phasic) to determine the causal relationship between working memory performance and dopaminergic activity dynamics. In Aim 4, we will integrate dopaminergic stimulation with electrophysiological recordings in dorsal striatum and prelimbic cortex to isolate the downstream changes in neural activity mediated by dopaminergic activity. Together, this work will provide new insights into the neural circuit mechanisms underlying working memory, with implications for both basic science and an understanding of the working memory dysfunction in various psychiatric disorders."
"9462764","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parathyroid hormone (PTH) plays a central role in regulation of calcium metabolism, but is presently the prototypic osteoanabolic hormone for treating osteoporosis. Nevertheless, the anabolic window for PTH treatment limits its usefulness. As a result, other anabolic therapies are under investigation. These include PTHrP and its analog, abaloparatide. Both are thought to be superior to teriparatide (hPTH1-34) for treating osteoporosis. All three agents act through PTHR1 coupled to Gs? resulting in increases in cAMP. The histone deacetylase, HDAC4 (a repressor of transcription), has been shown to be a major mediator of PTHR1 activity in both bone and cartilage. Haploinsufficiency of HDAC4 in humans results in brachydactyly (short digits), as do mutations of PTHrP and the protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit, PRKAR1A, indicating likely epistasis in this pathway. In osteoblasts, PTH causes exit of HDAC4 from the nuclei and derepression of transcription of catabolic genes, while PTHrP does not. Thus, the two hormones appear to have different actions on HDAC4. Our work in the last cycle of this grant led us to conclude that PTH action on the osteoblast causes PKA- dependent phosphorylation of HDAC4 in the nucleus resulting in its dissociation from Runx2 on the matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) promoter and induction of MMP-13 transcription. PTH also causes PP2A- dependent nuclear dephosphorylation of HDAC4 at a different serine. The post-translationally modified HDAC4 then traffics from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and is ultimately degraded. Deletion of HDAC4 from mature osteoblasts in mice in vivo results in a mild bone phenotype with increased bone MMP-13, sclerostin and RANKL and enhanced PTH responsiveness. From these data of cells in culture and our preliminary data in vivo, we have developed the central hypothesis that phosphorylation of HDAC4 is an essential regulator of its function in the skeleton, and PTH or PTHrP regulates this process. The long-term goals of this work are to delineate the signaling and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms conveying PTH or PTHrP action in bone. Consequently, the specific aims to test our hypothesis of this resubmitted competing continuation proposal focus on the phosphorylation of HDAC4 and the role of PKA, and will, 1) Determine the mechanism of PTH, PTHrP or abaloparatide regulation of HDAC4 in osteoblasts by, a. examining how PKA and PP2A regulate nuclear HDAC4, b. defining how PP2A is regulated by PTH, PTHrP or abaloparatide, 2) Determine the effect of manipulation of PKA in mice on HDAC4, its regulated genes in bone and subsequent bone development and metabolism by, a. establishing the effect of increased activity of PKA in osteoblasts on skeletal phenotype, b. identifying the effect of decreased activity of PKA in osteoblasts on skeletal phenotype, c. comparing the effects of PTH, PTHrP or abaloparatide on mice with osteoblast-specific decrease in PKA activity. The results of this work will make the firs and major contributions to our knowledge of how the PTHR1 exerts its nuclear effects on skeletal function through PKA. Moreover, it will define how phosphorylation of HDAC4 contributes to this and provide information as to why PTHrP and abaloparatide show superiority to teriparatide. In so doing, the data will provide new perspectives into treatment of osteoporosis."
"9463333","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cells assemble into complex arrangements that enable the specialized function of a tissue is a fundamental question in biology. For proper tissue assembly to occur, self-organization properties of cells must be coordinated with long-range signals that organize a tissue into the correct orientation, or polarity, within the body. Despite extensive research using genetic model organisms, the identity of these long-range polarizing signals remains unknown. As the field of regenerative medicine advances towards generating any cell type from multipotent stem cells, the discovery of long-range signals required for the proper three-dimensional organization of adult tissues will be essential.  Tissue polarity or planar cell polarity (PCP) refers to the collective polarization of cells globally alon the epithelial plane, and genetic disruption of PCP results in severe developmental disorders such as neural tube defects, cystic kidney disease, hearing loss, ciliopathies, and heart defects. While a core set of PCP genes conserved across species is responsible for communicating directional signals from cell to cell over short distances, what biases polarity globally toward a particular direction over long distances is unknown. One possibility is that a secreted or extracellular signal expressed in a concentration gradient across a tissue could provide a global polarizing cue. Alternatively, physical interactions between polarizing cells and their underlying substratum, or mechanical forces exerted during morphogenesis could lead to global alignment of cell polarity. Identifying the source of long-range polarizing signals will solve a long-standin problem in the polarity field and profoundly impact the field of tissue engineering.  The goal of this proposal is to identify the molecular and physical cues that orchestrate long-range tissue polarity and to decipher how cells asymmetrically reorganize in response to these directional cues. Using mammalian skin, one of the most strikingly polarized tissues in nature, a combination of genomic, proteomic, imaging, genetic, and biophysical approaches will be employed to: (1) Determine how graded directional cues bias tissue polarity in the epidermis; (2) Decipher the role of external forces in establishing long-range tissue polarity; and (3) Elucidate the mechanisms by which cells polarize in response to directional cues.  Identifying the instructive cues that direct the proper three-dimensional organization of a tissue is the next step towards engineering functional organs in vitro. Ultimately, identification of the pathways controlling normal tissue development will help to understand how misregulation of these pathways leads to developmental defects and adult proliferative disorders."
"9539099","Project Summary/Abstract Aging negatively impacts muscle mobility and function within the head and neck. In tongue muscles, aging is associated with a reduction in tongue force generative capacity that can negatively impact an older individual's ability to safely swallow during mealtimes. Swallowing impairment, also known as dysphagia, negatively impacts a person's quality of life and physical health. Dysphagia is linked to increased risk of aspiration which increases morbidity and mortality. Considering the rapidly growing population of people over the age of 65, treating dysphagia is critical to promote adequate health outcomes and reduce the financial burden of this condition. Current treatments for dysphagia may involve tongue strengthening exercises. While these exercises are routinely prescribed to patients, the current optimal dose necessary to effectively treat age- related tongue weakness is not known. Dose of exercise is an important factor to consider when developing a therapy regimen, and finding the minimally effective dose is necessary to ensure patient adherence to achieve desired results. We propose to study this treatment using a well-developed animal model of aging in order to examine the effects of dose on biologically meaningful variables related to tongue muscle structure and resulting swallowing function. The proposed research will use a well-developed rat model of aging to examine the effects of varied doses of tongue exercise (control, 1 day/week, 3 days/week, 5 days/week) on tongue muscle morphology (muscle fiber type and size) and metabolism (mitochondrial content and function) related to swallowing function. The hypothesis of this study is that the minimum dose for effecting biological change in tongue muscles will result in significantly improved swallowing function. Further, exercise doses larger than the minimum effective dose identified in this research will not deliver substantially improved swallow function. This work has 3 specific aims: (1) To quantify the minimum dose of tongue exercise effective in mitigating age-related changes in tongue force and resulting swallowing function; (2) To determine how different doses of tongue exercise affect age-related changes in morphology of tongue muscles and how these variables relate to swallowing function; (3) To determine how different doses of tongue exercise affect age-related changes in mitochondrial content and function in tongue muscles and how these variables relate to swallowing function. The proposed research is important and significant in developing appropriate protocols for tongue-exercise therapy to be used clinically. Understanding the impact of dose on tongue biology, metabolism, and swallowing function are necessary to develop evidence-based and ethical foundations for what is prescribed for use in people with swallowing impairment."
"9454221","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a debilitating blinding disease of older age that is increasing in prevalence in the Veteran population. There are currently no highly effective therapies for atrophic (dry) AMD, the most common form of this disorder. It is now appreciated that the vitamin A metabolite, all-trans-retinal, likely plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AMD. All-trans-retinal is released from visual pigments (rod and cone holo-opsins) in photoreceptor cells following their activation by light. For sustained vision, 11-cis-retinal must e continuously provided to the photoreceptor cells so that sufficient levels of light-sensitive holo-opsins are maintained. Rod and cone photoreceptors receive 11-cis-retinal from a metabolic pathway known as the visual cycle, which involves enzymes located in the retinal pigment epithelium. There is strong evidence that an alternative, Müller cell-dependent visual cycle also exists in the retina to provide cone photoreceptors with an additional supply of visual chromophore adequate for operation under daytime lighting conditions. Agents that inhibit production of 11-cis-retinal by targeting the classical visual cycle isomerase, RPE65, protect against light-induced damage to the retina by reducing the amount of all-trans-retinal released after light exposure. These agents have been proposed as potential pharmacotherapies for AMD. One inhibitor of the RPE-dependent visual cycle, called emixustat, is currently being evaluated for its ability to slow AMD progression in a phase 3 clinical trial. RPE65 inhibitors hol great promise as effective agents for the treatment of dry AMD, but they also have undesirable side effects on cone photoreceptors and color vision. The origin of these troublesome ocular side effects remains to be elucidated, but they could potentially arise from off-target interaction with components of the Müller cell-dependent visual cycle. Alternatively, because of the abundance of cones over rods in the human macula where AMD pathology occurs it is also conceivable that partial inhibition of the Müller cell-dependent visual cycle could be therapeutically beneficial for AMD treatment. Recently, a candidate retinoid isomerase of the Müller cell-based pathway, called sphingolipid-?4-desaturase (DES1), was identified in a high-throughput expression screen. This Müller cell-localized enzyme, originally characterized as a dihydroceramide desaturase, was shown to catalyze formation of cis retinol isomers from all-trans-retinol in vitro and partially restore retinal function when overexpressed in Rpe65-/- mice. However, the physiological contribution of this enzyme to cone cell function has not yet been studied. This proposal aims to 1) evaluate the physiological contribution of DES1 to cone-mediated vision using knockout mouse models and 2) capitalize on recently acquired high-resolution structural information on the binding mode of emixustat to the RPE65 active site to design novel visual cycle inhibitors with high selectively towards RPE65 and improved toxicity profiles. Retinal structure and function in Des1 conditional knockout mice will be assessed by high resolution imaging and electroretinography. Structure-guided drug design will be used to generate highly selective RPE65 inhibitors for potential use in the treatment of dry AMD."

"9490322","ABSTRACT The DRC Regional Metabolomics Core at Princeton provides Penn DRC investigators with access to state-of- the-art metabolomics and flux analysis. These capabilities allow DRC investigators to measure, both broadly and quantitatively, metabolic activity in cell culture, animal model, and clinical specimens relevant to diabetes and obesity. Now entering its 5th year, the Core has seen steadily increasing usage and is on track to analyze over 5000 samples in 2016. Thus, investigator demand for its services are high. This reflects the Core's position as a leader in metabolomics and lipidomics, with a particular focus on integration of these technologies with isotope tracing to reveal dynamic metabolic activity. In Aim 1, the Core will provide metabolomics services covering approximately 300 water-soluble metabolites and approximately 500 lipids. This will be achieved via mass spectroscopy-based analytical methods validated for their specificity and quantitative reproducibility. Aim 2 focuses on isotope tracer studies. To this end, the Core will guide tracer study design, carry out labeling pattern measurement, and facilitate data interpretation for both cell culture and in vivo research. Methods are now in place to trace major circulating nutrients in mice, and are being actively utilized to investigate mouse models of obesity and diabetes. Aim 3 involves expansion of the Core's capabilities. Beyond continuous improvement in breadth, depth, and quantitative reproducibility of metabolome coverage, this will include (i) new methods for in vivo tracing and (ii) establishment of a new joint Penn-Princeton Clinical Metabolomics Team to further increase clinical application of the Core's capabilities. The net effect will be to augment the scientific and clinical impact of the DRC through use of transformative metabolomics and flux analysis approaches to better understand?and thereby eventually more effectively diagnose and treat? diabetes, obesity, and related metabolic disorders."
"9455814","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metabotropic Glutamate receptors (mGluRs) belong to the Family C of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and critically regulates neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and plasticity through recognition of the amino acid and excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Many disorders of the CNS have been linked to alterations in neuronal excitability via the glutamatergic system. Accordingly, mGluRs have been the subject of an enormous drug discovery effort as they represent major therapeutic targets for treating numerous physiological dysfunctions and for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions. Apart from the prototypical seven transmembrane helix (7TM) domain, mGluRs also include a large extracellular venus fly trap' (VFT) domain that constitutes the glutamate binding site and a cysteine rich domain (CRD) that links the VFT to the 7TM. Binding of glutamate to the extracellular VFT domain triggers a large conformational change in the VFT domains from an open to a closed conformation. This clam-shell like closure of the extracellular domain results in receptor engagement and activation of G-proteins on the intracellular side of the transmembrane domain. Receptor activated G proteins then act to either enhance or repress secondary messenger signaling cascades. Despite intensive efforts, the mechanism of allosteric communication across the cell membrane by the mGluRs remains enigmatic due to the lack of structural information on full- length proteins. Here we propose to apply single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) visualization in order to characterize the structure of mGluR5 and mGluR2 in activated and inactivated states and also in complex with their cognate G-proteins. The obtained structures will be used for molecular dynamics simulations aiming to unravel the molecular basis for conformational transitions coupled to signal instigation or silencing. Given that mGluRs are important drug targets for several CNS conditions including Parkinson's disease, Fragile X syndrome/autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, cognition, addiction, depression, anxiety and pain, the results obtained will have profound biomedical interest and will form the basis for the design of novel therapeutic strategies against neurological disorders."
"9540761","PROJECT SUMMARY A substantial fraction of SNPs associated with human traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are likely regulatory variants as they tend to be located within enhancers and associated with differential gene expression. Thus, as a key step in implementing personalized medicine, it is important to identify regulatory variants in the human genome, and characterize their underlying molecular mechanisms. However, identifying and elucidating the functions of regulatory variants is currently challenging as these variants show similar associations with many other neutral variants due to linkage disequilibrium, can be quite far from the gene(s) they regulate, and often have cell type-specific effects. To overcome these challenges, the Frazer laboratory has established an experimental platform that enables the simultaneous interrogation of multiple processes involved in gene regulation, including the colocalization of distant regions of the genome through chromatin looping, the binding of many regulatory proteins to DNA, and the alteration of DNA methylation. This experimental platform, consisting of a biobank of 231 iPSC lines (from 214 individuals) and 140 iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (from 130 individuals), enables the generation and analysis of molecular phenotype data across hundreds of samples from different individuals. All individuals in the resource have 50X whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, and the lab is currently molecularly characterizing the iPSCs and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes via RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, and DNA-methylation arrays, as well as Hi-C data for both cell types from seven individuals in a three-generational family. These datasets, combined with analytic frameworks that integrate the effects of genetics on each of these phenotypes, provide a powerful experimental approach for systematically identifying and functionally characterizing regulatory variation genome-wide. In Aim 1, I quantify the extent to which genetic variants influence 3D chromatin structure, and identify genetic variants that affect gene expression by modulating chromatin architecture. In Aim 2, I will identify genetic variation affecting chromatin accessibility, use a quantitative framework to characterize whether this variation is systematically associated with functional regions of the genome, and determine the extent to which these enrichments vary by minor allele frequency and cell type-specificity. In Aim 3, I will integrate genetic associations across multiple molecular phenotypes to prioritize likely functional regulatory variants, and for each prioritized variant, propose likely underlying molecular mechanisms based on its patterns of association. Overall, the proposed project will establish an experimental and computational framework using multiple types of molecular phenotypes in iPSC and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to interrogate the molecular function of human regulatory variation. Insights gained from this approach will improve our understanding of the molecular impact of regulatory variation on complex disease and may enable better integration of regulatory variation into personalized medicine."

"9540534","Proposal Summary Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for ?50% of all patients with heart failure, and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and health care expenses. Yet no effective treatment for HFpEF has been identified. Commonly coexisting with other metabolic diseases, HFpEF is considered as the cardiovascular manifestation of a systemic metabolic disturbance. However, little is known about its underlying mechanisms. Our laboratory recently developed and validated a novel mouse model that faithfully recapitulates most clinical features of human HFpEF. Using this model, we discovered significant myocardial mitochondrial morphology changes indicating possible dysfunction, a potential common pathway linking metabolic distress with cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, the current proposal aims to identify specific mitochondrial defects and metabolic changes in HFpEF myocardium and their underlying mechanisms. Our preliminary data suggest that HFpEF mitochondria harbor a specific defect in fatty acid oxidation (FAO), which is accompanied by significant mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation. Further study is proposed to test whether hyperacetylation of key FAO enzymes, a known mechanism that impairs FAO in other metabolic diseases, also play a role in HFpEF. Given the fact that protein acetylation is a reversible process, we will test both in vitro and in vivo whether pharmacological agents that reverse protein hyperacetylaition attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction and improve cardiac function. Collectively, these studies will provide important insights into the mitochondrial metabolic defects characteristic of HFpEF. By focusing on reversible protein acetylation, the findings will have potential for immediate clinical translation. Furthermore, this work will serve as a critical platform for future mechanistic studies of HFpEF pathogenesis and for the next stages of my training.  "
"9453734","Project Summary Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects approximately 300,000 Americans resulting in devastating neurological and physical limitations. SCI in the chronic phase is complicated by muscle spasms, which are to a large degree caused by hyperactivation of the serotonin receptor 2C (5HT2C) caudal to the injury. Through a combination of alternative splicing and editing, the G-protein coupled receptor generates at least 25 isoforms with different regulatory properties: one intracellular truncated receptor 5HT2C_tr, one non-edited full-length receptor 5HT2C_Fl_INI and 23 full length edited receptors 5HT2C_FL_ed.  The ratio of these isoforms wherein the 5HT2C_FL shows constitutive activity plays a major part in the maladaptation after injury. SCI leads to a loss of editing activity of ADAR2 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA), which results in a downregulation of 5HT2C_FL_ed isoforms, relative to the 5HT2C_FL_INI. Extending our joint published work (Zhang et al., 2016, EMBO Mol. Med)1, we concentrated on the novel 5HT2C_tr isoform that sequesters the 5HT2C_FL intracellularly. We found an increase of the 5HT2C_tr isoform after SCI, possibly as an adaptation to prevent the constitutively active 5HT2C_FL_INI from hyperactivity.  To intervene with the isoform ratios, we developed a series of oligonucleotides that either increase or decrease the 5HT2C_tr /5HT2C_FL_INI ratio, as well as an antiserum that is specific for the 5HT2C_tr protein. Using these tools, we will test the hypothesis that SCI leads to an increase in both constitutively active 5HT2C_FL_INI and its downregulating 5HT2C_tr isoform. This change deregulates spinal cord neuronal activity leading to spasms, likely due to insufficient 5HT2C_tr isoform to stop the 5HT2C_FL_INI activity. We will thus further test whether these spasms can be mitigated using our developed oligonucleotides that promote 5HT2C_tr.  Using an established S2 spinal cord transection rat model, we will map the spatial and temporal changes in receptor isoforms and test the influence of splicing-changing oligonucleotides on the development of tail spasms. The oligonucleotides interfere with the serotonin system by changing the surface localization of constitutive active 5HT2C_FL, which is a novel approach compared to ligand- based drugs activating surface receptors. Using this innovative approach targeting the pre-mRNA, these studies are significant with great potential to treat spasticity, which is a major co-morbidity of SCI."

To this end, the PESC solicits and selects promising innovative pilot, exploratory, and developmental studies and secure optimal infrastructure, environment, funding, expertise, and resources. Core leaders monitor study progress, help analyze and interpret results, and provide guidance in translating these pilot data into high-quality and original research study proposals that successfully compete for independent extramural funding. The provision of funds for pilot, exploratory, and developmental studies supports Junior Scholars in their efforts to develop research careers in aging. The PESC also allows accomplished investigators in aging to gather data that extend and broaden their focus. In this capacity, it encourages and facilitates experienced investigators traditionally working in other research fields, such as physiology, cancer, pain, sepsis, and cognitive function, to expand their research to include aging. This widens the pool of talent that we believe will contribute to advances in disability prevention through averting mobility loss. In this application we propose four pilot studies and one exploratory study that offer a wide variety of interdisciplinary approaches to address the OAIC research theme. As we have proven over the past several years, we are highly successful in translating findings from our pilot, exploratory, and development studies into extramurally funded grants (76% success rate), and also in supporting our Junior Scholars through the tenure and promotion process."

"9505212","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this K24 is to provide salary, administrative, and research support for Lucas Hoffman, MD, PhD, to allow him to spend at least 25% of his time mentoring students, fellows, and junior faculty in patient-oriented research on the microbial determinants of chronic, pediatric diseases. This proposal will enable Dr. Hoffman to expand his translational research program, integrate trainees into the program, and provide additional protected time and resources for mentoring existing and additional trainees specifically in patient-oriented research as they work on existing translational research projects as well as new projects to emerge from this ongoing work. The proposal also provides time and infrastructure to help Dr. Hoffman enhance his mentoring skills, including classwork, new opportunities to interact with trainees, and an oversight committee specifically focused on this topic. The three ongoing, featured research projects leverage either existing resources (Project 1) or involve face-to-face interactions with patients (Projects 2 and 3) and are yielding novel questions and new resources for these and future patient-oriented studies, providing optimal opportunities for trainees: Project 1 investigates the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) microbiomes of infants with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF) with growth and other clinical outcomes during the first year of life. This project builds on our preliminary finding that young children with CF have GI dysbioses that are predicted to impact intestinal health and inflammation. As infants with CF often fail to grow adequately, and early nutritional outcomes correlate with overall disease course, identifying the mechanisms of early CF growth failure is an important and understudied topic. In this study, we are analyzing longitudinal fecal specimens and clinical data collected as part of a recently completed, multicenter clinical study of CF infant nutrition. Project 2 is an ongoing, multicenter study of variants of Staphylococcus aureus, the most common bacterial pathogen most commonly cultured from the respiratory tracts of people with CF. These variants, known as small-colony variants (SCVs), grow slowly in the laboratory and are not routinely detected by clinical laboratories. Our preliminary data indicate that SCVs commonly infect children with CF, and that they are associated with dramatically worse lung disease compared with children without SCVs. We are investigating the prevalence and clinical associations, as well as molecular mechanisms, of SCV infection in a cohort of children with CF. This study also collects bacterial isolates, linked data, and other resources for future studies. Project 3 is an ongoing, multicenter study of sputum microbiomes among children and adults with CF before, during, and after receiving a month-long treatment with inhaled tobramycin. The microbial determinants of CF lung disease and clinical responses are well-studied yet poorly understood. In this project, we are using high- throughput sequencing-based microbiome methods to identify the microbiome correlates of antibiotic response by comparing lung function changes with microbiome changes during antibiotic treatment with a single agent."
"9657412","Project Summary Lung cancer continues to be the most common cancer and reduction of lung cancer related death is a global priority. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported that the low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening reduced the lung cancer mortality by 20%, with a trade-off of more than 95% of false positive results. This underlined our need for a much improved risk prediction model and higher screening efficiency to balance the benefits and potential harms. Although there have been substantial efforts in establishing lung cancer risk prediction models, none have taken all aspects into account and the joint performance of all predictors remains unknown. For those with CT nodules, currently there is a wide range of clinical protocols on how they are managed, from watchful waiting to invasive diagnostic procedures. With the usage of LDCT scans rapidly growing following the NLST report, there is an urgent need to address the issues of (i) who should be recommended for screening and (ii) what to do when a nodule is found. Our research team is in the unique position to conduct this much needed work as we have already established extensive resources for the data elements needed being the lead investigators of the three lung cancer consortia (International Lung Cancer Consortium, Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of Lung, and Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium), and have established collaborations with the lung cancer CT screening programs in the US, Canada and Europe. The overall goal of this project is to translate the epidemiological, molecular and clinical data into lung cancer risk assessment and to improve nodule assessment. Specifically, we will (i) establish an integrated risk prediction model to identify individuals at high risk of lung cancer, combining personal health and exposure history, targeted molecular and genomic profile and lung function data based lung cancer CT screening populations in US, Canada and Europe based on a total of 950 CT-detected lung cancer patients from cohorts of 46,057 screening individuals; and (ii) establish a comprehensive nodule assessment models for individuals with LDCT-detected non-calcified pulmonary nodules based on both 2 dimensional-based and 3D volume and radiomics-based probability models. We will compare the model performance with the existing classification system such as Lung-RADS and conduct net benefit and decision curve analysis to assess their clinical usefulness. These models will be very valuable for the general public, clinicians, researchers and health administrators. It will increase the efficiency of lung cancer LDCT screening, and reduce unnecessary workup (and patient anxiety) for those who were found to have LDCT-detected pulmonary non-calcified nodules. The impact of this project will be wide-spread in our community."
"9541788","7. Project Summary/Abstract Long-term Objectives: African Americans routinely experience both subtle and overt racism and discrimination in their daily lives, which contributes to both physical and mental race-related health disparities. The proposed project seeks to extend understanding of the relationship between racial discrimination (RD) and psychological distress, as well as identify neurocognitive moderators that may function as vulnerability factors in the experience of negative psychological consequences of RD. The applicant's long-term goal is to establish a research program that investigates the cognitive, affective, and behavioral consequences of discrimination among members of minority groups, with a focus on health disparities related to race in the US and identifying interventions to mitigate the negative effect of discrimination. Specific Aims: The proposed project will combine a ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approach with an experimental lab component to 1) repeatedly measure experiences of racial discrimination (RD) and psychological distress in near real time, allowing the applicant to examine temporal precedence in the relationship between RD and psychological distress (Aim 1); and 2) examine attention to threat as a neurocognitive moderator that may function as a vulnerability factor in this relationship (Aim 2). Method: African American college students will complete three laboratory tasks during which EEG is recorded to assess attentional processes elicited by different types of threat. Participants will then report incidents of RD, momentary affect, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms (i.e., psychological distress) in near-real time using smartphones over the course of 4 weeks. Significance: The proposed project integrates a lab-based psychophysiological approach with an EMA approach to incorporate reliable measures of individual differences in neurocognitive attentional processes with tests of temporal associations between experiences of RD and psychological distress. Integration of the tightly controlled environment of the lab to measure individual differences with the ecological validity of EMA permits a much richer and more detailed analysis of the associations between RD, psychological distress, and neurocognitive moderators than has been possible in previous research on this topic."
"9472342","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Justine Wu, MD, MPH, is a family physician with clinical and educational expertise in family planning and primary care. Dr. Wu's long-term career goal is to become a successful clinical investiga- tor who leads efforts to develop practice-based interventions that improve contraceptive use and de- crease the rate of unintended pregnancy. She is particularly interested in understanding and address- ing the contraceptive needs of women with chronic medical conditions, including diabetes and hyper- tension. Upon completion of this 5-year career development award, Dr. Wu will have obtained the expe- rience and skills necessary to launch a career as an independent investigator. Public Health Context: The proposed project is relevant to the mission of NIH because it addresses the intersection of unintended pregnancy and chronic conditions, two significant public health issues that affect reproductive-aged women in the US. Adult women with chronic conditions have a higher rate of unintended pregnancy than adult women without chronic conditions. Chronic conditions and unin- tended pregnancy are both associated with pregnancy-related complications and adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Prior studies show that women with chronic conditions are not receiving ade- quate contraceptive counseling, particularly regarding highly effective contraceptive methods. There is an urgent need to improve contraceptive counseling and services for women with chronic conditions in order to decrease the rate of unintended pregnancy and improve reproductive health outcomes among this population. Proposed Research: The overarching goal of this proposal is to design and pilot test a theory-driven, interactive web-based contraceptive decision aid for women with chronic conditions and for use in pri- mary care. This decision aid will help women understand their contraceptive options within the context of their medical conditions, ongoing drug therapy, and personal preferences, and facilitate a shared- decision making process with their primary care providers (PCPs). The specific aims of this mixed methods, multi-phase study are: 1) to identify key factors on the patient-, provider-, and practice-level that are critical to the design of a contraceptive intervention for women with chronic conditions in primary care; 2) to develop an interactive, web-based contraceptive decision aid for women with chronic conditions, their PCPs, and implementation in primary care; 3) to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) decision aid versus usual care to assess the feasibility of the intervention and to determine the population size needed for a future R01 RCT. Project Innovation: The proposed contraceptive decision aid is innovative because it will: 1) be cus- tomized for women with chronic conditions and for use in community-based primary care sites; 2) be informed by a new conceptual model that draws upon elements of traditional behavioral health models and counseling methods; 3) provide clinical decision support for PCPs (in contrast to decision aids that focus only on patient education); 4) be executed via a rigorously-designed mixed methods study; and 5) reflect principals of implementation science such that the decision aid can be adopted for use in non- research settings. Training Plan: Dr. Wu's proposed research aims are coordinated with a mentor-guided training plan to gain experience in the following complementary areas: 1) mixed methods research; 2) decision sci- ence; 3) primary care practice-based research ; and 4) dissemination and implementation science. Dr. Wu's training aims will be achieved through: mentorship from an interdisciplinary team of experienced investigators; advanced didactic course work; scientific presentations at national and international con- ferences; participation in seminars and journal clubs; implementing her research plan; and manuscript preparation and grant proposal development for projects arising from the proposed research. Dr. Wu will be prepared to submit a competitive R01 application in Year 4 of this award to test her decision aid in a large randomized controlled trial. Training Environment: The University of Michigan (UM) and the UM Department of Family Medicine provide an outstanding research infrastructure and supportive environment for junior investigators. Dr. Wu's training and research plan will be directly supported by the following programs, institutes, and schools all located on the UM campus: the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (UM- CTSA), the Center for Health Communications Research, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecolo- gy, the Program on Women's Health Care Effectiveness Research, the Summer Institute for Survey Research at the Institute for Social Research, the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, the School of Public Health, and the Center for Statistical Consultation and Research."

"9447205","Project Summary/ Abstract The proposed K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the applicant with advanced training and skills to launch an independent research program focused on developing and evaluating implementation interventions that reduce mental health (MH) disparities for ethnically diverse families. This K01 proposal seeks to develop an evidence base for leveraging Lay Health Workers (LHW), community members without formalized MH training, to address determinants of MH disparities related to client demand for and the supply of behavioral parent training (BPT) programs in underserved communities. The community- partnered development and pilot evaluation of the LHW Enhancing Engagement for Parents (LEEP) implementation intervention will train LHW to conduct outreach and promote treatment engagement and skill acquisition for Latino families in Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT). Aim 1 of the study will assess the current context of LHW mobilization in children's evidence-based service delivery in community MH agencies through qualitative interviews with agency leaders and LHW, and quantitative surveys of LHW. Mixed-method analyses of these data will inform the development of LEEP. In Aim 2, the applicant will partner with community stakeholders to develop an implementation plan, structure, and process materials (e.g., fidelity measures) for LEEP. Aim 3 will pilot LEEP within an effectiveness/implementation hybrid design. Qualitative and quantitative data will inform the evaluation of LEEP including its feasibility, acceptability, and effects on client engagement, clinical outcomes, and implementation outcomes. The proposed study is well suited to the community setting and expertise the applicant brings to the project. Los Angeles County Department of MH (LACDMH) has invested considerable efforts in the implementation of evidence-based practices, including PCIT. The applicant's postdoctoral fellowship focused a MH policy reform within LACDMH, providing her insight into this large system of care. To meet her career objectives and the aims of this research project, the applicant requires additional training in: (1) implementation and health services research methodology to measure and reduce MH disparities; (2) application of implementation strategies and theories to inform the development of interventions to address supply and demand determinants of disparities; (3) approaches to improve parental entry into and engagement in treatment.

"9533437","PROJECT SUMMARY There is substantial evidence that soluble A? oligomers are neurotoxic and that impaired clearance of soluble A? is a critical pathologic mechanism in late-onset AD, a concept supported by the observation of decreased passage of A? into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in AD6 and the decreased levels of A? in the CSF of AD patients. The mechanisms for clearance of extracellular A? from the brain are multiple and include local enzymatic degradation, transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB), or via the CSF. The relative contributions of these various systems to A? clearance are not fully understood, although the BBB system appears to be predominant. However, recently, the glymphatic system has been implicated in this process, possibly in addition to BBB mechanism. The glymphatic system is proposed as a brain waste clearance pathway consisting of perivascular tunnels lined by astrocytes that drain into CSF and eventually into cervical lymphatic nodes. This system allows for the elimination of soluble proteins and metabolites from the central nervous system and it may be implicated in A? clearance and the development of AD. The clearance efficiency of the glymphatic system depends on CSF flow, cerebrovascular pulsation, and the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels of perivascular astrocytes. In mice, the efficiency of the glymphatic pathway appears compromised in aging due to impairment of AQP4 dependent bulk flow. The role of the glymphatic system in the clearance of A? and its relevance to AD is based mostly on studies in rodents, which is one of the reasons why it remains controversial. Therefore, the relevance of the glymphatic system to AD needs to be examined in the human brain, which is the overall goal of this proposal. Moreover, we believe that the best time to conduct this examination is before and during the early stages of A? deposition. To this end, we have available a large number of human postmortem brains from individuals 30 to 65 years of age which are fully characterized for AD lesions and tissue integrity, and genotyped for ApoE. The exploratory and observational studies proposed here are the basis for future mechanistic examination of the glymphatic system and its relevance to AD to be conducted in cultured cells and tissues, and animal models."
"9460983","Summary Aging and disease feature progressive deterioration in various physiological and metabolic processes and are associated with a decline in physical, cognitive, and sensory (hearing) function, all of which may lead to mobility loss or inability to walk without assistance. The University of Florida (UF) Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) Metabolism and Translational Science Core (RC2), in collaboration with all other UF OAIC cores, conducts translational research with biomarkers to determine mechanisms of this age-related mobility loss. The Core supports the hypothesis that genome instability (nuclear and mitochondrial DNA lesions), mitochondrial dysfunction, uncontrolled inflammation, excessive oxidative stress, and deregulation of apoptosis and autophagy are major contributors to aging-related loss of mobility. Focusing on these factors, RC2-supported research proposals use both standard and novel methodologies to address potential causes of mobility loss in older Americans. RC2 pursues the following aims: Aim 1: To support metabolism analyses for OAIC and external projects. To help OAIC investigators and external collaborators achieve their aims, the Core provides both scientific expertise and laboratory resources, including space and equipment. To investigate aging-related molecular, cellular, biochemical, and behavioral changes in animal and human studies we develop novel technologies, including intravital-multiphoton excitation laser-scanning microscopy, high-resolution respirometry, and quantitative assays for DNA lesions with Q-PCR. We also apply standard technologies (Luminex®/Western blot/PCR), and, in animal studies we perform functional phenotyping (physical function, cognition, and sensory/hearing). We store both human and animal samples for future ancillary studies in close collaboration with UF's Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) Biorepository. Our other functions relate to study design and protocol development. Aim 2: To provide research expertise and support for Junior Scholars or new investigators interested in research on aging. A central facility for acquiring research data and new laboratory skills (clinical to basic and basic to clinical), the Core provides one-on-one training, instruction, and organized workshops. It also advises scientists who are interested in new research areas or unfamiliar with certain techniques. By acquiring these new skills, OAIC Junior Scholars or investigators new to research on aging can further develop their interests independently. In summary, by measuring a selected set of functional, cellular, and molecular markers, we believe we can assess a unique, comprehensive spectrum of age-related alterations to determine which mechanisms cause age-related mobility loss. To this end, RC2 examines specific behavioral and biological functions critical during aging. It also provides numerous junior investigators and OAIC Junior Scholars research data; infrastructure; laboratory-procedures training; highly qualified personnel; consultative and collaborative expertise; and established methodologies of behavior, biochemistry, and molecular biology."
"9461623","SUMMARY: NONHUMAN PRIMATE CORE There is a critical unmet need to develop increasingly sophisticated animal models that will provide insights in the brain mechanisms that may underlie the development of schizophrenia (SZ) and inform the development of novel therapeutic interventions for this illness. While the underlying causes of the illness remain unknown, converging evidence suggests that SZ is a neurodevelopmental brain disease resulting from a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. Our group is using cross-species, complimentary approaches to examine one potential etiology of SZ ? changes in the prenatal immune environment that alter brain and behavioral development of the offspring. Evidence from epidemiological studies has shown that exposure to a variety of infections during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of having a child later develop SZ. Rodent models have played a critical role in establishing causal relationships between the activated maternal immune system and aberrant brain and behavior development in the offspring. The long term objective of the Nonhuman Primate (NHP) Core is to bridge the gap between human studies and rodent models, and evaluate the disease relevance of maternal immune activation (MIA) in a model system more closely related to humans ? the rhesus monkey. To accomplish this objective, we will undertake three specific aims. First the NHP core will sample and distribute archived brain tissue from an initial cohort of rhesus monkeys prenatally exposed to MIA to Projects 1 and 2 to evaluate the cellular and molecular pathology underlying aberrant behaviors of MIA offspring. Second, the NHP core will generate a new cohort of MIA and control macaque offspring needed to carry out a highly integrated series of structural, functional and molecular neuroimaging studies in Projects 3 and 4. Finally, the NHP core will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the behavioral development of the new cohort of MIA and control macaque offspring using novel measures that probe the core features of SZ. This interconnected evaluation of brain and behavioral development of monkeys prenatally exposed to MIA will provide further support for an animal model of SZ with high construct, face and predictive reliability. By accomplishing these aims the NHP core will contribute important new insights into the effects of MIA and the mechanisms by which it may contribute to the pathophysiology of SZ. If successful this will lead to the development of novel targets for the development of diagnostic biomarkers and innovative treatments for SZ and other neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9559205","Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent among U.S. military veterans. Excessive alcohol consumption, defined as the acquisition of a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) ? 0.08 g/dl (binging) or ? 15 drinks/week for men, is an important risk factor for many serious medical and psychiatric conditions, including AUD. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is important for integrating various internal and external states in order to determine approach/avoidant behavior to rewarding or aversive stimuli. Prior studies demonstrated that Poly- ADP ribose Polymerase (PARP), through its ability to regulate synaptic plasticity gene expression, promotes cocaine addictive behaviors. Whether PARP enzymatic activity plays a similar role in the addictive properties of ethanol (EtOH) has yet to be studied. The hypothesis of this grant proposal is that EtOH increases PARP activity causing reduced expression of certain neuronal synaptic plasticity genes in excitatory mPFC neurons ultimately increasing alcohol drinking behavior. EtOH increases PARP enzymatic activity in cell culture, adult binging animals, and during fetal development. PARP can silence gene expression by catalyzing reactions adding PAR groups (PARylation) to downstream gene regulatory proteins, including the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? (PPAR?) and KDM4D, a demethylase of the transcriptionally repressive dimethylated lysine 9 of histone 3 (H3K9me2). Examples of genes implicated in AUD that are well- established to be regulated by H3K9me2 are Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (Bdnf) and Ppar?. BDNF and PPAR? are expressed by excitatory neurons in the cortex, where both have roles in synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. Therefore, an alcohol induced suppression of BDNF and PPAR? expression would be expected to alter mPFC excitatory outputs, promoting continued alcohol drinking behavior. This is supported by reports indicating higher BDNF expression and PPAR? agonists reduce alcohol consumption. We reported that PARP activity is in part responsible for EtOH-induced decreases in Bdnf IV and IXa mRNA expression in primary cortical neuron cultures. We found several lines of evidence indicating that reduced PPAR? promoter binding may serve as an intermediary step between increased PARP activity and decreased Bdnf expression. We now propose to examine these same pathways in vivo. Our preliminary data indicate that mice that voluntarily consumed EtOH in the binge-like drinking-in-the-dark (DID) paradigm had increased PARP mRNA expression and enzymatic activity in the PFC. DID consumed EtOH reduced BDNF and PPAR? expression, effects that were reversed by PARP inhibitor treatment. DID EtOH consumption decreased PPAR? DNA binding ability generally and specifically at the Bdnf IXa promoter. Also, DID consumed EtOH increased global levels of H3K9me2, and PARP inhibition decreased H3K9me2 at Ppar? and Bdnf IXa gene promoters. Finally, we found that PARP inhibition reduced EtOH consumption in the DID paradigm. In the first aim, we propose dissecting the molecular mechanisms connecting PARP to changes in expression of genes involved in AUD in the mPFC following DID and 2-bottle free-choice drinking paradigms. In the second aim, we will examine the gene regulatory effects of EtOH-induced PARP in cortical excitatory neurons. This cell specific approach will utilize the Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) method for RNA isolation, and Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) isolation of excitatory neuronal nuclei for KDM4D, H3K9me2, and PPAR? binding experiments. We will also perform data-driven experiments using RNA isolated from excitatory neurons in transcriptome-wide microarray analysis. In the third aim, we will study the role of PARP in EtOH drinking behavior, such as DID and 2-bottle free-choice. We will test whether these changes are reversible using PARP inhibitors and PPAR? agonists. Results of the proposed studies are expected to clarify PARP?s role in regulating gene expression in relation to AUD. Based on these data it is possible that PARP inhibitors may be useful pharmacological tools for treating AUD."

"9453023","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brain arteriovenous (AV) malformations (BAVMs) can cause life-threatening strokes and have limited treatment options. The goal for this project is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying BAVM pathogenesis to identify novel candidates as therapeutic targets to ameliorate this disease. AVMs are characterized by abnormal AV shunts that displace intervening capillaries. We propose a cross-disciplinary approach, fusing cutting-edge mouse genetics and imaging technologies, to test our hypothesis that Notch mutations can reprogram AV identity and alter AV differential nitric oxide (NO) signaling, and thus endothelial dysfunction, to elicit BAVMs. Notch receptors and ligands are expressed in arteries but not veins. Notch signaling promotes arterial at the expense of venous differentiation by enhancing arterial and suppressing venous molecular markers. We have reported that endothelial expression of a constitutively active Notch4 mutation (Notch4*) elicits BAVMs in mice. Notch4* reprograms veins to gain arterial and lose venous molecular identity, and correcting the causal Notch4* leads to normalization of established BAVMs. We have built a custom two-photon microscope, optimal for structural and hemodynamic imaging of cerebral vasculature in live mice. We can thus obtain 5D data (3D plus blood velocity over time) through a cranial window to reveal the process of BAVM formation in mice. Built on our strong background and preliminary data, we propose: Aim 1 - Determine the effect of endothelial Notch4* on venous endothelial dysfunction and BAVM formation. We will test our hypothesis that Notch4* upregulates NO levels in the veins, alters venous endothelial response to blood flow, and thus permits AVM formation. We will examine the effect of Notch4* on venous NO signaling, endothelial response to blood flow, and flow mediated BAVM formation; Aim 2 - Determine the effect of endothelial Notch deficiency on arterial endothelial dysfunction and BAVM formation. We will test our hypothesis that loss of endothelial Notch gene function reduces arterial NO signaling, leading to arterial dysfunction and thus AVMs. We will analyze mice with endothelial deletion of Rbpj for BAVM pathology, arterial NO signaling, and endothelial response to blood flow stimuli; Aim 3 - Compare Notch and Alk1 mouse mutants in DA and CV development and BAVM formation. We will test our hypothesis that Notch interacts with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangectasia (HHT) 2 (or Alk1) in AV differentiation and AVM formation. We will compare the Notch and HHT mutant phenotypes using two-photon imaging and 3D rendering and perform genetic rescue. The findings from this study will conceptually advance our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of AVM pathogenesis, reveal novel functions for Notch in regulating the unique physiology of arteries and veins, and uncover interactions between the Notch and HHT pathways. The success of this work will inspire new areas of investigation in the fields of AVMs, Notch signaling, and vascular pathophysiology."
"9474592","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this project is to determine whether a commercially available soft bifocal contact lens with a distance-center design can slow myopia progression in children. Using soft bifocal contact lenses to manipulate the peripheral optics of the eye is a novel use for a standard contact lens that may keep children from becoming as nearsighted as they would otherwise. Secondary goals are to determine whether the amount of myopic defocus imposed on the peripheral retina by soft bifocal contact lenses is associated in a dose-dependent manner with slowed myopic progression and to determine whether peripheral myopic blur acts to slow eye growth locally or globally. These important pieces of information will enable investigators to learn about the role of peripheral optics for regulating eye growth, which could ultimately lead to optimization of optical signals to slow myopia progression. Ultimately, the information could be used to design optical devices to prevent the onset of myopia in young children. Slowing myopia progression or eventually preventing myopia onset could potentially affect approximately 60 million children in the United States alone. While the consequences of myopia are rarely sight-threatening, the quality of life for myopic patients is negatively affected, and the health care costs to treat myopia are astronomical (approximately $4.6 billion in 1990). The National Eye Institute recognizes the need to evaluate the efficacy of potential treatments for delaying the onset or for slowing the progression of myopia, such as lenses that alter peripheral defocus. Using a common treatment of myopia (contact lenses) to potentially slow myopia progression and to learn about optical signals that regulate eye growth is a very novel approach to solving a problem that affects a large proportion of people in the United States."
"9546684","From its inception, CAMRT has developed innovative neuroimaging methodology for use by our collaborators and service users as well as the community at large through dissemination and training. When we started doing fMRI research in 1993, our scanner did not have EPI-capable gradients, and we were forced to innovate. We found that spiral trajectories being developed by our colleagues in EE were highly efficient, and enabled us to collect excellent timeseries images with several shots instead of the 64 or more needed with conventional Cartesian methods. Thus, when CAMRT began in 1995 we continued to evolve innovative acquisition and analysis techniques, such as real-time fMRI and sparsely sampled acquisitions, driven by collaborators in the neurosciences and other cognitive biomedical fields. We demonstrated strong advantages to our spiral sequences over the more ubiquitous EPI techniques, and they are in use for tens of thousands of scans/year in our center and elsewhere. We became highly regarded by the extramural community for our technology (our top 5 fMRI papers in Google Scholar together have over 3000 citations), and have disseminated broadly. Building on our sound record of impact in fMRI and other neuroimaging methods for cognitive exploration, and motivated by investigators asking increasingly complex questions about the brain, we propose to develop fMRI acquisition techniques with higher spatiotemporal resolution, introduce highly novel array methods for neuromodulation of brain networks using both TMS and tDCS, and augment our DTI technology with new susceptibility weighted methods. These goals are highly consistent with the Grand Challenges in Neuroimaging identified by an NSF Workshop called in response to the BRAIN research initiative introduced by President Obama in 2013. We will also maintain our support of outside investigators through dissemination of pulse sequences, reconstruction methods and other software, and continue to train students and our users in state of the art neuroimaging technology."
"9462022","ABSTRACT The use of transgenic and gene knock-out genetically engineered animals is a powerful and informative approach that has been successfully undertaken by Core B in previous cycles to study neurodegenerative diseases. Core B provides Projects 1-4 with appropriately genotyped and aged mouse models of risk-factors for endosomal-lysosomal and autophagic abnormalities observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS). A particular focus is the breeding of mouse models that reproduce a broad range of pathobiological phenotypes relevant to late-onset AD, especially related to the lysosomal network. Core B also serves to acquire novel animal models with these pathologies, and to generate novel crosses between these models and transgenic, knockin, or knockout models that carry or lack genes expected to affect AD-related pathologies. The models either express or are deficient of factors that are mechanistically linked to endosomal- lysosomal and autophagy pathology in all forms of AD, including the accumulation of the ?-site cleaved carboxyl-terminal fragment of the amyloid ? precursor protein (?CTF), such as in a mouse model of DS; the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ?4 allele, the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD; hyperactivation of rab5, the key mediator of endosome dysfunction in AD; and altered cholesterol levels, studied by high fat and cholesterol diet. Models of lysosomal abnormalities in AD will include loss-of-function of the presenilin 1 or 2 (PS1 and PS2) gene as well as high cholesterol diet. This Program Project focuses on the sources and mechanisms that lead to endosomal pathology (Project 1 and 4), lysosome and autophagy dysfunction (Projects 2 and 4), and exocytosis (Project 3), using multiple mouse models, many of which are shared by more than one project. The Core Leader has extensive experience managing a large mouse colony with complex breeding schemes, and will be able to coordinate animal breeding, genotyping, and delivery to Projects 1-4."
