"9506434","Project Summary  Molecular-scale interactions lie at the heart of cell biology, and super-resolution microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for measurements inside cells. However, the current state-of-the-art does not include a generalizable method for mapping, measuring, and understanding real-time motions and biochemical interactions of pairs of mobile, dynamic components within cells. This gap is particularly critical in bacteria cells, in which many microscopy technologies are unproven or unfeasible due to small size and impenetrable walls. Something fundamentally different is needed: a new approach to understanding subcellular biochemistry in cells in real time. Thus, we aim to bridge single-molecule tracking, super-resolution imaging, and probabilistic statistical modeling to study pairs of molecules with the long-term goal of mapping the biochemistry of subcellular components in living bacteria cells. This exploratory proposal will develop interaction maps in living bacteria cells with two specific aims: (1) To observe pairs of mobile proteins and genetic loci with fluorescent protein fusions, CRISPR-dCas9 labeling, and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy in living bacteria; and (2) To measure the dynamics and interactions of these subcellular pairs with single-molecule tracking, Bayesian inference, and statistical modeling. The tools developed in this project will immediately benefit single-molecule imaging research by increasing the attainable information content. Furthermore, by focusing on applications in bacterial cell biology, the tools developed in this project will have a widespread, positive biomedical impact by making accessible long-term, significant questions in microbial biology."
"9462191","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lipid regulation of cellular signaling and protein-protein interactions Eukaryotic cells can be regarded as a vast, extensively compartmentalized and hierarchic protein- protein interaction (PPI) network. Characterizing PPI is therefore a crucial step in gaining an understanding of how cells function. PPI has also emerged as an attractive target space for drug development since PPI regulates numerous cellular processes, such as cell signaling. Despite the wealth of PPI data, however, the mechanisms by which complex cellular PPIs are coordinated and regulated with high spatiotemporal specificity are still poorly understood. This makes it difficult to understand the mechanisms of cell regulation on a systems level and also hampers development of specific drugs targeting PPI. Many PPI networks and protein complexes are formed on or near the cell membranes, the plasma membrane in particular. However, direct involvement of membrane lipids in coordination and modulation of PPI has not been explored. We have recently made breakthroughs in this line of research and revolutionized the PPI research by establishing that lipids directly and specifically regulate cellular PPI. This important new discovery as well as our innovative in situ quantitative lipid imaging technology give us a unique and unparalleled opportunity to systematically investigate how various lipids modulate PPI. We will study the mechanisms by which various lipids, including cholesterol and phosphoinositides, regulate a wide variety of cellular processes by spatiotemporally coordinating and modulating PPI through their specific interaction with protein interaction domains, including PDZ and SH2 domains. We will also develop new small molecule modulators of lipid-dependent PPI as drug candidates for various human diseases, including cancer. Given the general and fundamental importance of PPI, our pioneering, innovative research should have high potential impact on broad areas of biology and medicine."
"9411752","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early childhood is a critical period for establishing healthy diet and physical activity behaviors that may influence children's short- and long-term risk for obesity and other chronic diseases. Unfortunately, during this important stage of development, many preschool children have already adopted unhealthy diet and physical activity behaviors. Home and child care are two important spheres of influence that shape young children's diet and physical activity behaviors. Interventions engaging both spheres in a coordinated effort would ensure that children receive consistent health messages. There have been very few interventions that have targeted the child care setting, many of which made no attempt to engage parents. Those that did include a parent component generally used low-intensity strategies (e.g., newsletters, homework assignments). Innovative approaches that engage both the child care center and parents in a substantial and meaningful way are needed. Social marketing has been identified as a promising approach for health promotion efforts targeting children. Social marketing principals recognize the need to engage all individuals whose behaviors must be affected to bring about change, and to offer messages that emphasize benefits, and overcome barriers associated with behavior change. The application of social marketing principles in child care-based interventions is very limited. The proposed study is a two-arm, randomized controlled trial (86 centers and 860 children) to evaluate the effect of a 12-month intervention - Our Year of Healthy Living - on the diet and physical activity behaviors of preschool children (3-4 years) and their adult caregivers (parents and child care providers). The intervention will use a series of social marketing campaigns initiated in the child care center that incorporate visual cues, educational materials, activities, contests, and e-messages to deliver targeted messages. This study's primary outcomes are children's minutes of non-sedentary activity (measured via accelerometers) and diet quality (assessed with Healthy Eating Index scores). Secondary outcomes will assess: children's body mass index, food and physical activity practices in the child care center and at home, and health behaviors of child care providers and parents."
"9527883","Axial motor impairments represent a significant cause of disability in Parkinson disease (PD), which is mainly explained by a lack of efficacy of dopaminergic treatments of these symptoms. Treatment approaches to reduce balance problems and falls have been recently identified as the number 1 research priority in PD. Postural instability and gait difficulties (PIGD) motor features are mediated by widespread neural networks that extend well beyond the nigrostriatal system. There is increasing interest in dysfunction of non-dopaminergic neurotransmitters to better understand the complexity of the multisystem nature of mobility impairments in PD. Flumazenil is a short-acting intravenously administered modulator of the ?-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor benzodiazepine binding site, which has shown to rapidly improve motor impairments in PD. Based upon current basal ganglion models in PD, flumazenil could normalize neuronal signaling of hyperGABA-ergic activity in PD.  We have preliminary data that reduced cerebral GABAA receptor availability (likely reflecting increased synaptic or extracellular GABA-ergic activity) as determined by [11C]flumazenil PET imaging has most robust association with axial compared to other cardinal motor impairments in PD. Although flumazenil therapy has been shown to improve motor symptoms in PD, its practical limitation is that it can only be effectively and reliably given intravenously. Clarithromycin, on the other hand, is an FDA-approved antibiotic that is available in oral form. There is emerging in vitro and in vivo evidence that clarithromycin is a negative allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors in the brain, which is consistent with our preliminary clarithromycin [11C]flumazenil PET non-human primate data. The overarching goal of this project is to perform biomechanistic GABAA receptor target engagement studies to investigate the effects of GABAA receptor modulation to motor impairments in PD, including PIGD features. Our main hypothesis is that negative allosteric modulation of cerebral GABAA receptor activity improves motor impairments in PD, including dopamine-resistant PIGD features."
"9459373","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of eukaryotic cells requires intracellular organization, coordination, and locomotion. To overcome these challenges, cells utilize ATP-driven molecular motors, which transport intracellular components unidirectionally along cytoskeletal tracks. Kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein motors facilitate bidirectional transport of a variety of cargos by moving towards the plus- and minus-ends of microtubules (MTs), respectively. Detailed mechanistic models exist for kinesin, but the mechanism and regulation of dynein motility are still emerging. We found that S. cerevisiae dynein walks on a MT through uncoordinated stepping of its two catalytic domains and its mechanism of action differs significantly from the coordinated hand-over- hand stepping of kinesin. Surprisingly, despite recent advances in structural characterization of dynein, the molecular origin of its strong directional preference to move towards the MT minus-end remains unclear. Recently, a recombinant expression system was developed for human dynein, opening the doors for detailed studies of its molecular mechanism for the first time. Surprisingly, human dynein exhibited only short possessive runs and produces significantly lower forces than S. cerevisiae dynein in vitro, inconsistent with the ability of human dynein to transport large intracellular cargos over long distances inside cells. New work has revealed that processivity of human dynein is activated when it forms a 2.5 MDa ternary complex (referred to as DDB) with its cofactor dynactin and a cargo binding adaptor BicD2. In our preliminary work, we showed that dynactin and BicD2 also significantly enhance human dynein's force generation, suggesting that the DDB complex is a strong motor and a formidable opponent of kinesin when attached to the same cargo. The goal of this proposal is to dissect the mechanism of active human dynein complexes and determine how dynactin and BicD2 regulate dynein's ability to compete against kinesin-1 during bidirectional cargo transport. We have three specific aims. First, using protein engineering and single-molecule imaging, we will identify the mechanical components of dynein that give rise to its minus-end directed motility. We will also solve the MT-bound structure of reverse directionality constructs via cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) to reveal the structural basis of dynein directionality. Second, we will identify which part(s) of the motor is responsible for its autoinhibition and characterize how dynactin and BicD2 regulate the mechanochemical cycle, stepping pattern and force generation of human dynein. Third, we will reconstitute bidirectional cargo transport on MTs in vitro using purified human kinesin and DDB complexes and reveal the mechanism and regulation of tug-of-war between these motors. Success of our aims will significantly advance the understanding of the fundamental mechanochemistry of human dynein and learn how it achieves retrograde transport of intracellular cargos."
"9443623","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to define how polymicrobial infection impacts the development, severity, and treatment of bacterial otitis media. Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) is the leading bacterial species associated with otitis media, and our data show that coinfection with multiple strains of Hi is common. We hypothesize that strains of Hi undergo intrastrain and interstrain quorum signaling and horizontal gene transfer within biofilm communities which impacts strain diversity and horizontal dissemination of virulence determinants. In order to address these hypotheses we will complete the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To understand relationships between Hi strains with differing production and/or sensing of quorum signal Specific Aim 2. To ask how different inters train relationships affect bacterial persistence and disease severity in the chinchilla infection model Specific Aim 3. To define emergence and dissemination of virulence determinants among Hi strains within the same biofilm community. Otitis media is among the most common pediatric infectious diseases, affecting the majority of children and accounting for billions of dollars in ttal health-care costs per year. It is clear that a significant proportion of these infections are cause by Hi, for which there is no currently licensed vaccine. Unfortunately, our ability to treat these infections is increasingly limited by the continued emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. The results of these studies will provide significant insight into how different Hi strain act competitively and/or cooperatively during infection. Moreover, we will gain significant new information regarding how new genotypes emerge and are disseminated within a biofilm community. These findings will be crucial steps in gaining the deep understanding of basic mechanisms for persistence and virulence that will be necessary for tailoring new strategies for diagnosis, prevention, and/or therapy of otitis media infections."

"9454500","Depression is the most common neuropsychiatric manifestation following stroke and current treatments are largely ineffective. Depression has both direct and indirect effects on response to rehabilitation treatment; thus subjects with post-stroke depression (PSD) are routinely excluded from rehabilitation trials and treatment options for these individuals are extremely limited. We propose to determine the impact of two known anti-depressive treatments shown to be effective in non-stroke related depression - aerobic exercise training (AET) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) - on post-stroke depressive symptoms. Further, we will determine if depression limits gains in walking function in response to treatment and if successful reduction in depressive symptoms facilitates improved walking. This project is based on the premise that depression negatively affects the potential for the brain to adapt in response to treatment such that rehabilitation may not produce the same brain changes that it does in non-depressed individuals. We propose that effective treatment for PSD would result in a virtuous cycle where reducing depression enhances brain changes, thereby facilitating functional gains. That is, effectively treating depression will make the brain better able to recover from stroke. Furthermore, in addition to its beneficial effects on depression, AET is known to improve post-stroke walking, thus providing an attractive option for treating depression as well as an established vehicle to study the effects of PSD on response to locomotor rehabilitation. The experiments proposed as part of this project are designed to address critical questions related to the: 1) effects of AET and/or rTMS on depressive symptoms; 2) potential for PSD to limit improvements in locomotor function; 3) impact of combining AET and rTMS treatments; and 4) relationship between baseline subject attributes and response to treatment(s). Successful completion of this project will provide a foundation for larger scale therapeutic trials to establish the effectiveness of AET and/or rTMS on post-stroke depression and walking as well as identify the mechanisms that may be responsible for the changes that occur in response to treatment."
"9270089","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a shape memory polymer (SMP) foam embolic device for treating cerebrovascular aneurysms. The SMP implants are superior to current clinical alternatives in that they 1) acutely clot faster and more completely throughout the aneurysm volume and 2) chronically heal by forming collagenous scars. Cerebral aneurysm rupture occurs in approximately 30,000 people per year in the United States with devastating consequences. Three-fourths of patients will either die or become neurologically debilitated. Given the increasing utilization of CT and MRI scanning, many unruptured aneurysms are being identified as incidental findings, and are commonly treated in order to prevent aneurysm rupture, which carries a >50% risk of severe neurologic dysfunction or death. Current endovascular treatment involves delivery of coils through the arterial system to fill the aneurysm, requiring on average 5- 8 coils to treat a single aneurysm. In 30% of treated aneurysms, the coils migrate or become compressed. This compaction opens a pathway for the blood to re-enter the aneurysm, causing the aneurysm to balloon once more. Coils, since they are metal springs, also present a risk of rupturing the aneurysm they are intended to fill. The healing response to coils is another major deficiency: Chronically the central core region of the aneurysm is composed of loose, cellular connective tissue, foci of debris, and clotted blood, rather than having a more stable fibrocellular composition. In order to apply to the FDA by the end of this study with an IDE application, the following three specific aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1: Engineering, Quality System (QS) and Manufacturing. Specific Aim 2: Design Verification. Specific Aim 3: Design Validation."
"9478538","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Over 2 million long bone fractures are treated in the United States every year. Although most bone fractures heal spontaneously there is no gold standard for promoting bone regeneration in those settings in which either fractures do not heal or there is a critical sized segmental bone defect due to trauma or infection, devastating medical problems leading to significant disability. The recent development of custom printed biomaterial scaffolds that can fit and fill large bone defects may provide a novel solution and coating these scaffolds with agents designed to promote more rapid and complete bone healing may increase the efficacy of prosthetic scaffolds in healing segmental bone defects. Although currently used to promote bone generation, growth factors such as rh-BMP2 (BMP2) are of questionable efficacy and present significant safety issues. We have recently reported that adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) stimulation increases osteoblast number and regulates osteoblast function in a murine model of inflammatory osteolysis and that A2AR stimulation diminishes osteoclast differentiation by inhibiting NF¿B activation and nuclear translocation. Moreover, A2ARs stimulate angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we propose to test the hypothesis that 3- dimensional printed scaffolds coated with an agent, dipyridamole, that increases local adenosine levels and indirectly stimulates A2ARs can further promote bone regeneration at critical sized segmental bone defects and to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms for this phenomenon. We therefore propose the following aims: I. Development of coated bioactive ceramic scaffolds to treat critical segmental bone defects. We will determine whether implanting 3-dimensionally printed calcium triphosphate/hydroxyapatite scaffolds coated with dipyridamole, an agent which blocks cellular adenosine uptake and increases adenosine concentration in extracellular fluids, promotes bone regeneration in a rabbit radius model of segmental bone defect. We will further maximize scaffold design and dipyridamole dosing in vitro and in a murine calvaria model of bone regeneration. II. Determination of the cellular mechanism by which A2AR stimulation promotes bone regeneration. Using global and cell-selective knockouts of A2AR we will determine the cellular basis for A2AR-mediated bone regeneration in the murine calvaria model. III. Examination of the molecular mechanisms by which A2AR stimulation promotes bone regeneration in osteoblasts. We will test the hypothesis that A2AR signaling interacts with critical intracellular signaling cascades to promote bone regeneration using pharmacologic inhibitors of signaling pathways and by targeted knockdown of critical signaling molecules in primary cells and cell lines. The goals of this highly translational project are to establish the molecular and cellular basis for targeting A2ARs to stimulate bone regeneration and to rapidly translate these findings to the clinic."
"9481873","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary RNA regulatory networks in motor neuron development and function Post-transcriptional regulation at the RNA level, such as alternative splicing, plays a critical role in generating of the cellular and functional complexityof mammalian nerve cells during neuronal development. This regulation is dictated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interacting with their target transcripts, thereby profoundly affecting the output of the transcriptome. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the organizational principles of these RNA regulatory networks and their functional impact on neuronal development at the systems level. Despite very significant progress made over the past few years, current efforts to dissect neuronal RNA regulatory networks are facing two major challenges: i) cellular heterogeneity of the brain tissue used as a major source of material for genomic and biochemical analysis of regulatory networks, and ii) difficulty and inefficiency of simultaneous perturbation of multiple regulators important for functional evaluation of the discovered networks. Both challenges are reflected in studies of the Rbfox RBP family, in which the three functionally redundant members Rbfox1 (A2bp1), Rbfox2 (Rbm9) and Rbfox3 (NeuN) are preferentially expressed in many types post-mitotic neurons and are believed to regulate a large set of important neuronal transcripts. So far, only a small number of Rbfox target transcripts have been validated in physiological contexts and the function of Rbfox proteins or their targets in specific neuronal cell types is poorly understood. In this proposal, we will particularly focus on motor neurons, which are the nerve cells required for muscle contraction and movement and are lost in several fatal neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesize that a concerted action of Rbfox proteins is critical for motor neuron development and function. To test this hypothesis, we will employ, in parallel, an in vitro but physiologically relevant stem cell differentiation system and an in vivo mouse model, in which various combinations of Rbfox family members are depleted in motor neurons as a means of elucidating their cell type-specific function at the molecular and cellular levels. The target networks directly regulated by different Rbfox family members will be defined by comparative analysis of genome-wide, high-resolution profiling of cell type-specific transcriptomes, unbiased maps of protein-RNA interactions, and integrative modeling of multiple modalities of data generated by these genomic and biochemical assays. Functional validation of a select subset of Rbfox targets will be performed to establish the link between splice variants and specific aspects of neuronal developments. Results from our studies will not only provide novel insights into the function of neuronal RBPs in motor neuron biology and the underlying molecular mechanisms, but also have the potential to expand our understanding in the consequence of disrupted RNA metabolism in motor neuron diseases."

The goals of this program are to build novel imaging technologies for discerning mechanisms of cancer biology, designing new targeted therapies, and developing innovative imaging modalities for improving patient care. The CI program covers a continuum of imaging research reaching from ?molecules to mice to man? that forms the basis for the following three Specific Aims: (1) Utilize imaging agents to study cancer pathogenesis and develop cancer-targeting therapeutics, (2) Codify quantifiable imaging metrics to study cancer biology and improve cancer treatments, and (3) Translate novel imaging methodologies to patient care. These aims reflect major working groups and initiatives that actively engage researchers from basic biology, medicine, chemistry, physics, and engineering backgrounds with other Cancer Center investigators through inter-programmatic collaborations that result in highly impactful advances in imaging and nanomedicine. Extensive use of an array of shared resources, in particular Imaging, Athymic, Cytometry, and Biostatistics facilitate all aspects of member discoveries. Under the leadership of James Basilion (Co-Leader) and Zhenghong Lee (Co-Leader) the CI Program has 29 members including 19 full, 2 associate, and 8 clinical members. Members represent 9 departments, giving rise to a total of $8.1M in research grant funding (annual direct costs), of which $7.3M is peer-reviewed and $4.0M is NCI-funded. Between 2012 and 2016, CI program members published 639 publications. Cancer and program related publications included 27% inter-programmatic, 25% intra-programmatic, 10% inter- and intra- programmatic and 7% that involved collaborations with another Cancer Center. This highly effective program has made major advances in imaging and nanomedicine. Examples include: the discovery and international distribution of a novel quantitative MRI imaging analysis tool based on random magnetic wave generation (MR fingerprinting); development of novel nanoparticle diagnostics and therapeutics, including plant derived viral particles to stimulate host immune rejection of tumors that is now in clinical studies in dogs with melanoma; generation of a fibronectin-targeting agent for detection of breast cancer micrometastases; and the invention of a multimodal in vivo imaging method for following the disposition of nanoparticles on a microscopic scale as well as visualizing the microvasculature of tumors in live animals."
"9518323","Project Summary: Illness behaviors and metabolic disturbances are common in pancreatic cancer patients, and may lead to wasting or cachexia. This devastating state of malnutrition is brought about by a synergistic combination of a decrease in appetite and an increase in metabolism of fat and lean body mass. The severity of cachexia in many illnesses is the primary determining factor in both quality of life, and in eventual mortality. Other illness- induced morbidities including lethargy also compromise the ability of patients to recover from life-saving or extending interventions, and diminish the motivational drive to aggressively battle the condition. Although cachexia in cancer patients was described more than two thousand years ago, the central mechanisms underlying this disorder are poorly understood. Furthermore, there is currently no effective pharmaceutical treatment. Our laboratory is dedicated to unraveling the basic neuroscience of cachexia. In this proposal, we will focus on understanding the scope and mechanism by which signals of pancreatic cancer development are received, amplified, and maintained by the hypothalamus. The significance of this proposal resides in its unique combination of our historical focus on neuroendocrinology and behavior, with new collaborations and efforts directed at understanding the role of extracellular vesicles in neuroinflammation. The long-term goal of our research is to gain mechanistic understanding of the acute illness response and how it is transitioned into chronic inflammation-associated cachexia in order to develop more effective therapeutic interventions."

"9541562","PROJECT SUMMARY Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus. The recent ZIKV outbreak in the Americas uncovered unusual pathologies, were intrauterine infections early during pregnancy were associated with developmental and neurological anomalies such as microcephaly, and the development of Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. These devastating clinical manifestations together with the rampant spread of the Aedes mosquito make ZIKV a formidable health threat. To date there is no vaccine, and antiviral treatments are elusive. To develop effective therapies however a thorough understanding of the molecular biology of ZIKV is essential. Similar to other flaviviruses, replication of the viral genome likely requires a change in the conformation of the ZIKV genome from a linear to a circular configuration. While putative complementary elements in the ZIKV 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) have been identified, the mechanism(s) regulating long-range RNA-RNA interactions for circularization are unknown. We have identified two RNA-RNA interactions within the 3' UTR that would either inhibit or promote circularization of the ZIKV genome. In this proposal, I will investigate the role of the dumbbell RNA structure in the 3' UTR in the regulating long-range RNA-RNA interactions between cyclization sequences to direct ZIKV replication. In Aim 1, I will use structural studies and bioinformatics to identify the structure of the 3' dumbbell RNA structures, and molecular biology and virology assays to elucidate the function of the ZIKV 3' dumbbell RNA structures. Using similar approaches in Aim 2, I will confirm putative RNA-RNA interactions in the 3' UTR and investigate how these RNA-RNA interactions regulate the shape of the ZIKV RNA. This proposal will reveal new facets of ZIKV biology, and will uncover the mode by which ZIKV utilizes RNA structure to regulate viral translation and replication. The outcomes of these studies will impact our understanding of the structure, function and regulation of the viral genome of other viruses in the Flaviviridae family such as Dengue virus that presents a growing threat to human health. Moreover, dissecting the pivotal role of RNA structure may eventually provide a foundation for developing new antiviral therapies for this re-emerging and devastating virus."

Therefore, FLT3 inhibitors have been developed as a targeted treatment approach. Although the inhibitors show considerable efficacy in vitro and in animal models, clinical trials using FLT3 inhibitors as single agents have been underwhelming, with few complete remissions and a high rate of relapse and resistance. Thus, there is a need for a FLT3 inhibitor that increases complete remission rates and reduces relapse of FLT3-ITD AML patients.  To combat the many mechanisms of resistance used by cancers, polypharmacology is gaining popularity in the field of drug discovery. This method, using a single agent to interact with multiple targets, has several advantages over selective inhibitors or drug combinations; primarily, targeting multiple pathways simultaneously decreases the likelihood of resistant clones.  We propose that Interleukin-1 Receptor Associated Kinase 1 (IRAK1) and IRAK4 are candidates for targeted therapy in combination with FLT3 inhibition. The IRAK1/4 kinase complex mediates signaling downstream of the IL-1 (IL1R) and Toll-like (TLR) Receptors; however, these signaling pathways are also implicated in several hematopoietic malignancies, and the efficacy of IRAK1/4 inhibition has been demonstrated in preclinical models of AML, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, and Acute Lymphoid Leukemia. In preliminary data, treatment of FLT3-ITD positive AML cells with the second generation FLT3 inhibitor, AC220, results in a marked increase in IRAK1/4 phosphorylation, an indication of IRAK1 and IRAK4 activation. Collectively, these findings suggest that IRAK1/4 activation permits outgrowth of AC220-resistant cells and is a suitable candidate to target in FLT3-ITD positive AML.  Our central hypothesis is that the inhibition of FLT3-ITD results in a compensatory increase in IRAK1/4 activity to promote cell survival; thus, targeting both pathways simultaneously will decrease the likelihood of the development of resistant clones. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: (1) Determine the crosstalk between FLT3 and adaptive IRAK1/4 signaling in AML and (2) Determine the efficacy of a novel polypharmacologic IRAK1/4 and FLT3 inhibitor.  Collectively, these studies will dissect adaptive FLT3-ITD signaling in AML, elucidate a novel resistance pathway in AML, and provide a novel and improved therapeutic strategy to treat FLT3-ITD AML."
"9462241","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): India has the largest number of individuals co-infected with HIV and M. tuberculosis in the world, and TB is the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV+ patients in India. The immune dysfunction caused by HIV-infection alters clinical and radiological presentation of TB; HIV+ TB patients are often asymptomatic, about half the patients are paucibacillary, and over 50% of the patients have extrapulmonary TB. Paucibacillary pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB in HIV+ patients is difficult to diagnose due to lack of affordable diagnostic tests, often poor accessibility to the ste from which the specimen has to be obtained for testing, and the invasive techniques required to obtain the specimen for diagnosis. The poor performance of insensitive diagnostic tests currently used for TB diagnosis in TB-endemic settings like India leads to significant under- diagnosis of TB in the very population where TB progression is rapid and often fatal. Thus, despite being totally treatable with the existing drugs, the lack of appropriate diagnostic tools results in identification of less than half of the HIV+ TB patients being diagnosed before death. The goal of this HIV Research Training Program (HRTP) is to provide training and capacity building for fostering basic research on understanding the pathogenesis of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB in HIV+ patients, with the ultimate goal of devising rapid, simple and accurate point-of-care tests for diagnosis of active and subclinical, pulmonary and various forms of extrapulmonary TB. Facilitate new research efforts aimed at understanding the pathogenesis, immune responses and host-pathogen interaction in pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB in HIV+ patients (Aim 1); provide training in specific cellular, molecular and immunological techniques and the related troubleshooting, and in bioinformatics required for initiating the research project defined in aim 1 (Aim 2); mentor and support trainees for developing research projects in their parent lab (Aim 3), and establish long-term collaborative relationships between NYU and scientists in the partner institute (Aim 4). Training will be provided to young tenured faculty members and PhD students from the Post Graduate Institute for Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India. PGIMER was one of the seven collaborating institutions on the NYU AIDS International Training and Research Program (AITRP, since 2001; NCE till 2014). The training of 10 (9 faculty and one PhD student) under the former AITRP has resulted in i) training to 5 clinicians in clinical care of HIV/TB and TB patients; ii) establishmet of an immunodeficiency clinic for providing clinical care to HIV+ patients, that is now designated as Center of Excellence for Clinical management of HIV+ patients, and provides ART to >4000 patients from 6 states in northern India; iii) training of 3 clinical mycobacteriologists who now rn accredited TB labs for culture and drug susceptibility testing, and iv) trained two basic science faculty with whom collaborative research has been ongoing or initiated. PGIMER is rapidly improving its research infrastructure and staff. The proposed HIV Research Training Program proposes to build on this already strong foundation that has been established over the last decade."
"9693571","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Maternal drug addiction constitutes a major public health problem for both women and affected children, with long lasting consequences on children's social, emotional and cognitive development. Current treatment strategies tend to focus on the mother and her current addiction, rather than her relationship with her child, and developmental processes that may perpetuate the addiction problems, such as unresolved childhood attachment trauma, neglect, and chronic stress. Unlike mothers who find engaging with their own infant to be a uniquely rewarding experience, mothers with addictions may be less able to respond appropriately to their infant's cues, finding them less intrinsically rewardin or salient, and more stress provoking. Our current study has identified key areas in dopaminergic and oxytocinergic brain pathways that show a diminished functional MRI response when addicted mothers view the faces of their own vs. unknown infants, compared with non- addicted mothers. These areas include the hypothalamus, striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Oxytocin, a neuropeptide with decreased peripheral levels seen in addicted mothers, is integrally involved in maternal brain and behavioral responses. When administered intranasally, our pilot data has shown enhanced activation of the striatum, prefrontal cortex and amygdala. The purpose of this renewal grant is to continue and expand upon our investigation of maternal addiction, by conducting a randomized, double-blinded, placebo- controlled, crossover study of intranasal oxytocin on maternal brain responses. A new group of 150 mothers from our two current study sites (Baylor College of Medicine and the Yale Child Study Center) will be enrolled (75 with a history of drug addiction and 75 matched control mothers), along with their 4 to 7-month-old infants, to participate in four study visits over a two-month period. During Visit 1, mothers will complete the Adult Attachment Interview to determine their attachment classification and to identify markers of unresolved trauma. At Visit 2, a videotaped free-play assessment of mother-infant interaction (the CARE-Index), and a modified Still Face Procedure, will be conducted to assess the quality of maternal caregiving and synchrony. During the final two study visits, functional MRI will be used to compare maternal brain responses to infant face cues after receiving either intranasal oxytocin or placebo, comparing own vs. unknown happy and sad faces. We will focus on activation of, and functional connectivity between, the striatum, prefrontal cortex and amygdala, key reward and stress related regions containing oxytocinergic neuronal connections. We will also examine factors that may moderate oxytocin's effect in the brain, including attachment classification, mother-infant synchrony, sensation-seeking or risk-taking behavior, and stress/trauma exposure. This knowledge will contribute significantly to our long-term goal of discovering novel treatment strategies for mothers who suffer from drug dependency and addiction."

The PRMC has authority to close ongoing studies that are not meeting accrual or performance standards and are unlikely to accomplish their scientific goals, and a structured process for accrual monitoring and evaluation is followed. All new protocols and protocol amendments that include scientific changes, such as revisions in objectives/endpoints, eligibility, treatment/dosing, biostatistics, and sample collection, are evaluated by the PRMC. In 2016, there were 588 active interventional studies at Case CCC monitored by the PRMC. The PRMC reviewed 237 new studies (full board review: 183; administrative review: 44; tissue-based: 10). The PRMC also reviewed 330 amendments. ! !"
"9600866","Abstract Catheter-related blood-stream infections (CRBSI) can result in substantial morbidity, undue mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and increased healthcare costs. Based on the national infection control guidelines, an accurate determination of the number of organisms colonizing a catheter is crucial in assessing significant catheter colonization, one of the criteria for the positive determination of CRBSI. Healthcare providers make therapeutic decisions based on the diagnosis of CRBSI, including antibiotic therapy. Therefore, it is extremely important to correctly enumerate the number of organisms colonizing a catheter. Proper and timely diagnosis of catheter- related infections can help healthcare providers make the appropriate management decisions that can prevent complications including sepsis and death. The major goals of this project include the optimization and enhancement of a sensitive and novel technique for detecting microorganisms on intravascular catheters and to assess the comparative efficacy of this method for diagnosis of catheter-related blood-stream infections."

"9495740","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways mediate actions of hormones and neurotransmitters. They are essential for normal function of the nervous system and are frequently disrupted, and/or exploited for therapeutic purposes, in many neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. While we learned considerable information about molecular players involved in shaping GPCR signal transmission there are many critical gaps in our understanding of mechanisms pertaining to signaling regulation. Among biggest uncharted territories in GPCR field is an issue of orphan receptors, GPCR-like molecules with unknown signaling mechanisms. It is generally recognized that orphan receptors have tremendous potential for uncovering novel biology of the nervous system and harnessing it for potential therapeutic benefits. Our long- term goal is to understand principles for organizatio and functional regulation of GPCR pathways in the effort to develop better treatments for brain disorders.  The focus of our attention is on the Regulators of G protein Signaling (RGS) proteins that terminate G protein signaling and are increasingly viewed as regulatory hubs for signal transmission in the GPCR pathways. We have found that a member of RGS family, RGS7 plays essential role in mood regulation. Investigating the mechanisms of its action revealed that it controls the activity of the inhibitory G protein Inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels and that i the brain it forms tight complexes with previously uncharacterized orphan receptor, GPR158. Our preliminary data suggest that GPR158 is involved in determining activity, localization and expression of RGS7 and thus may represent an essential new GPCR signaling component. Intriguingly, knockout of either GPR158 or RGS7 in mice results in a prominent reduction in anxiety/depression-related behaviors.  Based on accumulated preliminary data we hypothesize that GPR158 is the critical regulator of G protein signaling that act by modulating the function of RGS7 proteins in the nervous system. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three complementary Specific Aims that seek to: (1) determine mechanisms, by which GPR158 regulates catalytic activity of RGS7, (2) analyze the role of GPR158 in controlling expression and localization of RGS7 in the brain and (3) determine contribution of GPR158 to regulation of GIRK channels and neuronal excitability. The strategy proposed to address these Aims will entail a synergistic combination of biochemical, electrophysiological and cell-biological approaches, exploiting the existence of a powerful array of reagents and animal models. We hope that accomplishment of these goals will provide critical new insights into the mood regulation in mammals and suggest novel targets for the development of therapeutic interventions."
"9394903","In the long-term care (LTC) setting, 70% of residents receive at least one course of antibiotics each year and up to 75% of this use is reported to be inappropriate or unnecessary. The harms of antibiotic misuse in frail older LTC residents are significant, including Clostridium difficile infection, adverse drug events and drug interactions, and colonization and/or infection with resistant bacteria. This crisis has prompted the President of the United States to formally recognize antibiotic misuse and resistance as a global public health crisis and a key national security threat. In response, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recently outlined Core Elements to improve antibiotic use in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) and mandate that at least one Core Element be implemented immediately. While these Core Elements are timely, they are based on data extrapolated from acute care hospitals, an environment that differs substantially from LTC. Effective and financially resourceful antibiotic stewardship interventions to improve patient safety in LTCFs remain unknown and absent, particularly within the VA. As such, there is a critical need for the development of tailored antibiotic stewardship interventions to improve the care of the 50,000+ Veterans who reside in VA LTCFs (known as community living centers or CLCs) annually. Treatment of suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) is the largest contributor to antibiotic use in LTCFs. Much of this use is unnecessary and/or inappropriate. My recent work showed that over 50% of initial antibiotic selection for suspected UTI was inappropriate at two VA CLCs. There is a vast amount of literature targeting providers and nurses evaluating interventions designed to improve the appropriate diagnosis of UTI. However, focused on diagnosis, these studies have failed to correct inappropriate treatment selection when antibiotics are truly indicated. This is extremely concerning as true UTIs are the most common cause of hospitalization in LTC residents and the number one cause of bacteremia. Clinical pharmacists are drug therapy experts and are ideally suited to correct inappropriate UTI antibiotic therapy. Therefore, I hypothesize that an educational program targeting CLC pharmacists will lead to improved antibiotic use for UTIs. My long-term goal is to improve the quality of care of residents nationally through reduction of inappropriate antibiotic use. Accordingly, the work proposed, creates, implements, and tests a feasible ?real world? model for antibiotic stewardship in VA CLCs. This model places the pharmacist in a prominent antibiotic stewardship role by taking advantage of a pharmacist?s expertise in guiding appropriate antibiotic use, while using the pharmacist as a consistent presence for many CLCs. This model was specifically designed with the ability to disseminate this work to VA CLCs nationally. To improve the utility of this model, interventions will be based off facility-specific antibiotic use rates and antibiograms. The objectives of this proposal are to pilot test the implementation and effectiveness of our antibiotic stewardship intervention through three specific aims: Aim 1. To describe antibiotic use and inappropriate antibiotic use for suspected culture positive UTI among VA CLCs nationally and identify independent predictors of inappropriate antibiotic use. Aim 2. To develop an educational intervention targeting CLC pharmacists to reduce inappropriate treatment of UTIs and pilot test the intervention in two CLCs. Aim 3. To evaluate the effectiveness of the educational intervention on UTI related antibiotic use (primary outcome), and the frequency of inappropriate antibiotic use, and absence of de-escalation by day 4. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to result in an intervention that can be disseminated broadly to effectively improve antibiotic use, and ultimately improve resident safety through reduction of antibiotic resistant infections in CLCs nationally."

"9462927","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide and the leading cause of renal failure in East Asia. The affected individuals develop characteristic IgA1-containing antibody complexes that deposit in the kidney, producing progressive renal injury. The disease is associated with a specific pathogenic defect in the O-glycosylation of IgA1 that promotes formation of immune complexes. Similar to other immune-mediated disorders, IgAN has a complex genetic architecture. In a recent GWAS involving 20,574 individuals, we identified 15 genome-wide significant susceptibility loci for IgAN. Our new loci implicated both adaptive and innate immunity in the disease pathogenesis and defined the Network of Intestinal IgA Production as the key pathogenic disease pathway. Based on our results, we developed an original multi-hit pathogenesis model that describes sequential steps and molecular candidates involved in the development of the disease. In this application, we propose to further refine this model by defining additional genetic hits involved in the defective regulation of mucosal IgA response. We specifically aim to discover additional IgAN susceptibility loci by a quantitative GWAS for serum levels for IgA and galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1). The GWAS discovery phase will include a well-powered multi-ethnic population-based cohort of 9,707 individuals. New genome-wide significant loci will be replicated independently and annotated using existing datasets and public resources. Next, through integrative network-based analyses, we will dissect precise pathogenic mechanisms behind each of the GWAS risk alleles. We will use a systems genetics approach that integrates RNA-seq and SNP microarray data to reconstruct gene regulatory networks in IgA1 secreting cells. Based on our network analyses, we will define master regulators and key drivers of the disease process. Our network predictions will be validated using experimental, computational, and genetic approaches. These studies are expected to refine the disease pathogenesis model and will be critical in defining potential targets for novel therapeutic interventions in IgAN."

We propose to provide leadership in the design, analysis and conduct of the studies of the PETAL Network and to provide the infrastructure and communications that will create a cohesive and productive group. Over the past 18 years we have served as the coordinating center of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Network under the leadership of an experienced clinical trials statistician and an acute care physician. We recently published our approach to the statistical and logistics issues of the ARDS Network. We propose to enhance those methods to improve performance of these activities for PETAL. Our proposal for the PETAL network focuses on the novel challenges of prevention trials. We suggest that the feasibility of a prevention trial depends on the choice of endpoint, in particular that studies using mortality as the primary endpoint would not be feasible with a conventional trial design and other clinical endpoints may be problematic. The optimal endpoint would be the occurrence of ARDS or a measure of the clinical consequences of ARDS. The proposal discusses the issues of cluster randomized trials and adaptive designs. We discuss the statistical and scientific issues in creating a biomarker resource for the PETAL Network. We also describe our proposals to increase productivity of the network by implementing an efficient IRB review process, plans for applying a computer-assisted technique to set network priorities, and plans for soliciting community involvement on an ongoing basis. We describe the methods we will use to provide the needed infrastructure (such as a remote data and trial management system) and the coordination of all network activities: data quality control, protocol compliance, protocol initiation, randomization, drug distribution, sample management, adverse event reporting, statistical reporting, data dissemination, communication, and logistics."
"9693554","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has indicated that Native Hawaiian youth have significantly higher rates of drug use than their non-Hawaiian counterparts (e.g., Wong, Klingle, & Price, 2004; Mayeda, Hishinuma, Nishimura, Garcia- Santiago, & Mark, 2006; Nishimura, Hishinuma, & Goebert, 2013), and that these differences are particularly pronounced in rural settings (Lai & Saka, 2005). Despite these findings, there have been very few drug prevention programs developed and evaluated specifically for these youth (Edwards, Giroux, & Okamoto, 2010; Rehuher, Hiramatsu, & Helm, 2008). Therefore, the purpose of this research proposal is to complete the development of a video-enhanced, culturally grounded, school-based drug prevention curriculum for rural Native Hawaiian youth (Ho'ouna Pono), and to evaluate the curriculum across all public middle/intermediate schools on Hawai'i Island. This will be accomplished through three specific aims. AIM 1 (Year 1) is to complete the Ho'ouna Pono drug prevention curriculum initially developed and validated in a NIDA-funded translational pilot/feasibility study (R34 DA031306). To date, five professionally filmed video vignettes depicting drug-related problem situations specific to rural Hawaiian youth and seven interactive classroom lessons have been created, implemented in randomly selected intervention schools, and preliminarily evaluated using a pre-test, post-test control group design. Aim 1 enhances and builds upon this work by producing two new video vignettes, re-editing a Behind the Scenes video, developing new classroom curricular components, and synthesizing the new content with the existing curriculum. AIM 2 (Years 2-3) is to evaluate the fully conceived curriculum across all middle/intermediate schools on Hawai'i Island (N = 15) using a dynamic wait- listed control group design (Brown, Wyman, Guo, & Peña, 2006). AIM 3 (Year 4) is to assess community, systemic, and curricular factors related to the implementation, adoption, and sustainability of the curriculum within public middle/intermediate schools on Hawaii Island."
"9596165","Marburg virus (MARV) belongs to the filovirus family and is highly pathogenic in humans. Despite being classified as Category A Priority Pathogen by NIAID, and its potential to cause large-scale outbreaks, similar to the recent Ebola virus outbreak, research on MARV lags significantly behind that on other non-segmented negative sense (NNS) RNA viruses. Here, we propose to perform in-depth analyses of MARV transcription and gene expression. Dissecting the mechanisms of MARV gene expression will not only be instrumental for the targeted development of antiviral drugs, it will also reveal unifying paradigms and distinctions between the NNS RNA viruses. The filovirus genome is transcribed by a virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex, which is capable of generating capped and polyadenylated mRNAs. This process occurs in the cell cytoplasm, close to ribosomes and cellular RNA binding proteins. This project will examine three different stages of MARV gene expression. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the mechanism of transcription initiation at the MARV promoter and investigate the role of structural features of the polymerase in this process. Notably, the MARV promoter sequence has some unusual features, and we intend to explore the functional relevance of these characteristics. In Aim 2, we will determine the function of conserved hairpin loops that are formed at the 5´ end of each MARV mRNA. We will explore the effect of these structures on transcription, RNA stability, trafficking and translation. In Aim 3, we will focus on mRNA polyadenylation and release. The mechanism of mRNA release is not well understood for any NNS RNA virus, and the results obtained in this aim will help to broaden our understanding of NNS RNA virus transcription strategies. This proposal brings together expertise in studying NNS RNA polymerases, MARV molecular biology, and mRNA-protein interactions. Together, the research team has established a unique tool set to achieve the goals of this proposal, including a MARV in vitro polymerase assay, various MARV reverse genetics systems, and highly innovative single molecule mRNA-protein binding assays. These studies will shine new light on a crucial aspect of MARV infection and enhance our understanding of NNS RNA virus biology."

A component of the CREATE plan is the convening of a series of strategic planning sessions with key faculty and administrators around topics associated with BBR development and promotion. A related component to strategic planning is improved faculty access to workshops on topics including funding opportunity identification, grant writing, proposal development, and successful grant management in addition to individualized grant support. Finally, the CREATE plan seeks to actively engage community, regional, state, and national partnerships designed to foster collaborative BBR opportunities for UTC faculty and students.    2"
"9481710","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application for the tPPG Vascular Sub-Phenotypes of Lung Disease extends our drug discoveries over the last 4 years to three clinical trials in each of our three Projects. We will initiate a Personalized Medicine approach to the study and treatment of pulmonary vascular disease, focusing on how a patient's diet, microbiome, and development of metabolic syndrome will contribute to pulmonary vascular disease and its therapy. In our tPPG we hypothesize that sub-phenotypes of common diseases, such as the metabolic syndrome, have a profound influence on pulmonary vascular disease symptoms, prognosis, and response to therapy. The overarching translational goal of this program is to define the common mechanistic and therapeutic pathways of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in the context of major lung and systemic diseases, such as the metabolic syndrome - and target this biology with new drug strategies stemming from the productive first years of this project. In the initial funding period we developed a) new pre-clinical mouse and rat models of PH in the setting of metabolic syndrome, b) characterized a major signaling paradigm in biology linking dietary nitrate and the microbiome to the reactive nitrogen species, nitrite and nitrated fatty acids (NO2- FA), all of which modulate PH in pre-clinical models, and c) developed promising new GMP drug strategies evolving from this pathway that exhibit strong safety profiles in humans. In this tPPG renewal we have translated these discoveries into sub-phenotype-targeted drugs and phase 2 clinical trials.         Our tPPG was designed as a drug development pipeline where the drugs across all Projects were tested in pre-clinical models for safety and efficacy, and then developed based on success. Successful drugs moved to GMP formulation and phase 1 safety studies in collaboration with the NIH pharmacy development service and by partnership with biotechnology companies. Our overarching strategy was to develop an internal competition between Projects to identify the best drugs for clinical trial evaluation in the second phase of th tPPG. To this end we have completed pre-clinical studies and human phase 1 safety, PK/PD and early proof of concept trials with inhaled and oral preparations of nitrite and nitrate, and boh intravenous and oral formulations of 10-nitro-oleic acid (NO2-OA), strongly positioning our group for the next translational directive of the tPPG mechanism - to move these discoveries to phase 2 trials, commercialization and improved patient care. Based on extensive data generated over the last cycle of this tPPG, we hypothesize that new nitrate-nitrite-NO-NO2-FA therapies target both the metabolic syndrome and the pulmonary vasculature, and will limit disease progression in patients with this sub-phenotype. In this regard, our proposed translational research plan will aggressively address this unmet need by employing nitrate, nitrite and NO2-FA pharmacologic strategies that pleiotropically target the dysmetabolic, pro-proliferative and pro-inflammatory milieu of PH        Narrative:  In our tPPG, we have proposed that pulmonary vascular disease is a relatively under-studied, but important sub-phenotype in the broader setting of chronic heart and lung diseases, increasing disease severity and complicating therapy. Pathological pulmonary vascular remodeling occurs in subsets of patients in the setting of left heart diastolic dysfunction, the metabolic syndrome, and is a secondary event in advanced lung diseases. The development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in these settings is further modulated by host genetics, diet, and microbiome and the development of the most effective specific therapy likely requires dual targeting of the underlying conditions, such as metabolic syndrome and the pulmonary vascular sub-phenotype. Based on extensive data generated over the last cycle of this tPPG, we hypothesize that new nitrate, nitrite, and nitro-fatty acid based therapies, that have now successfully advanced through human phase 1 safety testing, will target both the metabolic syndrome and the pulmonary vasculature, to limit disease progression in patients with this PH sub-phenotype."
"9476324","Cognitive deficits are major disabling impairments associated with autism and schizophrenia. Because the underlying genetic and cellular mechanisms of such deficits are still poorly understood, mechanism-based therapeutic options do not exist, limiting the effective integration of patients into society. Previous clinical work has shown that executive functions such as working memory and cognitive flexibility start to lag behind from adolescence to adulthood in individuals with autism and schizophrenia. However, the precise genetic, anatomical and cellular substrates through which this occurs are still poorly understood. We have identified two genes encoded in copy number variants (CNVs) at human chromosome 22q11.2, a high-risk factor for autism and schizophrenia, for which dose alterations impair the developmental maturation of working memory. Our published work shows that mice developmentally expand working memory capacity from adolescence to adulthood and that constitutively elevated activity of catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) impairs the working memory of mice during adulthood, but not adolescence. During the previous funding period, we have further found that over-expression of COMT and the transcription factor TBX1, another 22q11.2 gene, in adult neural progenitor cells of the hippocampus recapitulates this age-dependent deficit in working memory capacity. The objective of the proposed project is to test our overarching hypothesis that dose alterations of CNV-encoded genes impair the developmental maturation of executive function through defective adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. To test this hypothesis, we developed experimental tools to regulate CNV- encoded genes in adult neural progenitor cells in the hippocampus at specific developmental time points. Moreover, we have established a screening system to identify other autism- and schizophrenia-associated CNV genes whose dose alterations affect adult neurogenesis and executive function. Our experimental readouts include executive function and adult neurogenesis. Upon completion of the proposed studies, these technically innovative experiments will, for the first time, establish a common cellular mechanism through which altered doses of autism- and schizophrenia-associated genes impair the developmental maturation of executive function. Identification of the developmental time window, neuroanatomical region(s), and cellular subtypes necessary for maturation of executive function will have a major impact on our understanding of the developmental mechanisms of executive function and its derailed trajectories. This proposal could lead to a better understanding of the neurobiological substrates for an important dimensional aspect of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders."
"9479247","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to employ novel therapies in patients who are at risk for or who have early ARDS in order to reduce the significant attributable mortality and to improve both short term and long term morbidities (1,2). As a participant in the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL) Network, our specific aims are:         1. The creation of a two site multi-disciplinary network for recruitment into PETAL studies. Principal Investigators and Co-investigators from the Divisions of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Acute Care Surgery, and the Emergency Department Intensive Care Unit (ED-ICU) at the University of Michigan will collaborate to insure early identification and robust recruitment o study subjects.  Additionally, investigators from the Emergency Department and the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine of Henry Ford Health System, our second site in this network, have joined to create a rich environment in which to recruit patients for PETAL studies. This environment is strengthened by the inclusion of a fully integrated ED-ICU, providing a unique continuum of care for critically ill patients at these institutions, permitting early recruitment and intervention in these patients.         2. The annual recruitment of at least 40 high quality enrollees into PETAL protocols through the  continuation and initiation of multiple overlapping recruitment strategies, including a novel alert mechanism through the electronic medical record, calculation of lung injury prevention scores, targeted  capture of select at risk populations and traditional coordinator screening.         3. Prevention of ARDS: To determine the effect of GM-CSF administration on relevant clinical outcomes in patients with severe sepsis who are at risk for ARDS. The primary outcome measures are 28- and 90-day mortality. Major secondary end-points include the development/progression of ARDS and other organ failures, resolution of sepsis, duration of ICU and hospital stay, and long term functional recovery. Biological outcomes include monocyte innate responses and systemic inflammatory responses.         4. Early intervention in ARDS: To determine the effect of azithromycin administration on relevant clinical outcomes in patients with early onset ARDS. The primary outcome measures are 28- and 90-day mortality. Major secondary end-points include ventilator-free days, organ failure free days, infectious complications, duration of ICU and hospital stay, and long term functional recovery. An important biological outcome to be assessed is the influence of azithromycin therapy on temporal changes in the lung microbiome. These highly novel studies are to be led by a Co-Investigator with outstanding expertise in this arena."
"9502355","African Americans have the highest rates of hypertension in the world. Effective therapies and awareness of hypertension in African Americans have declined this past decade contributing to further racial disparities in cardiovascular (CV) disease rates and mortality compared to Caucasians. Further, the traditional recommendation for lifestyle management of hypertension with diet and aerobic exercise is based on data obtained from studies involving mostly Caucasians. There are no exercise prescription guidelines for improving blood pressure specific for African Americans and the management of hypertension in this population continues to be problematic. A recent study in our laboratory showed divergent effects of resistance exercise training on blood pressure and arterial function in African Americans compared to Caucasians indicating that resistance exercise may exert more beneficial effects than aerobic exercise on early vascular risk. Thus, the goal of our research program is to determine novel exercise interventions, designed to optimally target arterial function and lower blood pressure in African Americans with pre and stage 1 hypertension. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that is that African Americans with pre-hypertension and stage 1 hypertension will show greater benefit from resistance exercise training on arterial function and blood pressure and retain the benefit longer than aerobic exercise. Conversely, in Caucasians, aerobic exercise will improve arterial function and reduce cardiovascular risk more than resistance exercise. Aim 1 will test the comparative effectiveness of 8-weeks of resistance or aerobic exercise training and de-training on blood pressure in African Americans with pre- and stage 1 hypertension compared to Caucasians. This will be tested with a prospective, randomized, 8 week resistance vs. aerobic exercise training intervention followed by 8 weeks of detraining in African American and Caucasian adults (18-45 years old). Aim 2 will test the comparative effectiveness of 8-weeks of resistance or aerobic exercise training and de-training on 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure and arterial stiffness in central and peripheral arteries in African Americans compared to Caucasians. Aim 3 will determine the effectiveness of 8-weeks of resistance or aerobic exercise training and de-training on arterial function in conduit and resistance arteries of pre- and stage 1 hypertensive African Americans compared to Caucasians. This will be determined in large (brachial artery FMD) and in small (dilation of isolated resistance arteries to acetylcholine and flow) arteries obtained from subcutaneous fat. In vivo determination of arterial function and physiologic approaches of resistance artery functioning are highly relevant to the pathogenesis of hypertension. These studies will serve determine the site and source of improved vascular health after resistance training in African Americans and Caucasians. Relevance: This study will provide clinically important data on how blood pressure can be optimally lowered by exercise and may show that resistance exercise training is the lifestyle intervention of choice for blood pressure lowering in African Americans."
"9570707","Project Summary / Abstract:  Obesity and related health disparities represent significant public health challenges that continue to have a negative impact on society. In particular, obese Latino youth are a key and vulnerable population that experience disproportionate rates of type 2 diabetes. To address these disparities, our team of academic and community partners through support from NIMHD and the Southwest Interdisciplinary Research Center has collaborated for 10 years to develop, implement, test, refine, and expand a community based-based, family- focused diabetes prevention intervention for obese Latino adolescents. Every Little Step Counts (ELSC) is a comprehensive lifestyle intervention that is framed within an Ecodevelopmental Model to leverage individual, social, community, and cultural factors in order to improve health behaviors (nutrition and physical activity) and reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes among obese Latino adolescents. Preliminary results from our current P20-funded trial support the efficacy of the ELSC intervention to improve glucose tolerance among 90 obese Latino adolescents (age 14-16). We now propose a long-term follow-up of participants who completed ELSC over the past four years and are now young adults (age 18-22) in order to 1) describe individual diabetes- related health profiles following the lifestyle intervention and 2) examine how cultural family norms, the home food environment, and neighborhood environment are associated with changes in health profiles over time. We will use latent profile analyses to examine the following aims. Specific Aim 1: To describe individual diabetes risk profiles over a 5-year period in response to a culturally-grounded diabetes prevention intervention for obese Latino adolescents. Specific Aim 2: To examine whether cultural family norms that include family cohesion, familism, and supportive parenting styles are associated with individual diabetes risk profiles over time. Specific Aim 3: To examine whether the home food environment (availability of fruits, vegetables, high- sugar foods and beverages) is associated with individual diabetes risk profiles over time. Specific Aim 4: To examine if the neighborhood built environment (walkability) or social environment (disadvantage, cohesion, and trust) are associated with individual diabetes risk profiles over time. The project builds upon an established academic-community collaboration and a comprehensively characterized cohort from a vulnerable and underrepresented population. The team has an extensive track-record for translating research findings into meaningful health promotion and disease prevention interventions in the community. This project targets an understudied population that has undergone a critical developmental transition that is associated with future health outcomes. Lastly, the contextual factors of interest have not been studied in the context of long-term health changes following lifestyle intervention. The findings from this project will directly inform further refinement of a successful intervention in order to make a greater impact in a population at very high risk for diabetes-related morbidity."
"9551661","PROJECT II: CHARACTERIZATION OF MOUSE MODELS TO VALIDATE NOVEL CDH GENES AND IDENTIFY CLINICALLY RELEVANT TARGETS FOR TREATMENT OF PULMONARY DEFECTS OF CDH PATIENTS. ABSTRACT: This proposal reflects an ongoing collaboration by a multidisciplinary team of scientists from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) and the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) to make discoveries that could address the medical needs of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) patients. As a team, we bring together expertise in genomics, bioinformatics, mouse models, and clinical experience in the care of these patients with this lethal human condition in which a small increase in respiratory function could lead to survival and normal life expectancy. To address the current gaps in knowledge about the underlying genetic etiology of CDH, we have sequenced human exomes of CDH patients, prioritized the variants as candidate genes through computational integration of human genetic data with developmental expression data from mouse lung and diaphragm tissue, and then linked those prioritized candidates into molecular pathways using protein-protein interaction data. Candidate genes emanating from these integrative analyses will be evaluated in in vitro assays of alveologenesis and for subsequent functional validation in mouse models. If these prioritization steps are favorable and if current models are unavailable, new models will be generated by gene editing in the CRISPR/Cas9 pipeline at the JAX. We will also leverage ongoing unbiased phenotype screens underway at JAX as part of the second phase of the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP2) to identify novel genes associated with diaphragm and lung defects, one of which (SVEP1) is already under evaluation (see Fig. 4 ). Mutant mice will be phenotyped directly by microCT imaging of E15.5 or E18.5 embryos and postnatal pups at the JAX, and with histological analyses, lung morphometrics, and expression of cell lineage specific markers at the MGH. Our top priority will be on phenotypic evaluation of genes manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia with alveolar simplification or failure of septation, with the hypothesis that such gene defects can be improved therapeutically after birth. Bioinformatics will be used to incorporate candidate gene variants prioritized by expression in lung and diaphragm transcriptomes, into molecular pathways from which to impute therapeutic targets. The most appropriate cell based, organ culture, and postnatal mouse models that respond to therapeutics selected from small molecule screens in Project III and inferred from drug discovery algorithms, will be carefully studied to demonstrate rescue of function in in vitro, ex vivo and, eventually, in vivo knockout mouse models generated from this Project."
"9471207","Project Summary  Planar cell polarity (PCP) is a core cell contact and signaling pathway that is largely conserved from Drosophila to mammals, and is fundamental to early development and tissue organization in complex, multicellular organisms. The long-term goal of this study is to further our understanding of how central PCP protein, Celsr1, mediates adhesive interactions required for the establishment and maintenance of PCP. Acting orthogonally to apico-basal polarity, PCP is the collective and organized polarization of cells along a tissue plane. A striking example of PCP is the ordered alignment of body hairs on mammalian skin. Core components of this pathway include: Celsr (Flamingo/Fmi), Frizzled (Fz), Vangl (VanGogh/Vang), Dishevelled (Dvl), Prickle (Pk) and Diego (Dgo). A hallmark feature of PCP is the asymmetric localization of Fzd/Dv/Dgo and Vangl/Pk at cell borders within a junctional complex organized via intercellular interactions of Celsr, a large atypical cadherin and member of the GPCR super-family. Disrupting Celsr function in mice leads to a range of detrimental phenotypes including neural tube defects, abnormal hair patterning and embryonic lethality. Further, multiple Celsr mutations in humans have been associated with neural tube defects and diseases such as spina bifida and cardiomyopathies. While important developmental roles for Celsr at the tissue-level have been established with mouse and fly studies, an understanding of Celsr function at the molecular and cell level is lacking. To elucidate how PCP asymmetry is achieved, we need to define the mechanisms of Celsr1 extracellular adhesion. The mouse skin is an ideal model system to investigate the conserved mechanisms of PCP and our lab has recently established a spontaneously polarizing in vitro, organotypic model system for assaying PCP asymmetry and function. Super-resolution imaging techniques such as structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) further add to our robust toolbox to study epidermal PCP. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate how the principle PCP protein, Celsr1, mediates extracellular adhesion to coordinate functional PCP. We hypothesize that Celsr1 cadherin repeats mediate intercellular and lateral adhesive interactions required for asymmetrical PCP protein localization and function. Understanding how individual cell-cell interactions at the molecular level contribute to tissue structure and function will fill a substantial and fundamental knowledge gap in the PCP field. This proposal integrates molecular biology, biochemistry and advanced microscopy approaches to elucidate mechanisms of PCP asymmetry and function in vitro and in vivo. Completion of these studies will provide novel insight into the mechanisms the regulate PCP in the mammalian epidermis at the most fundamental level and illuminate our conceptual understanding of PCP complex formation and function."
"9469882","Project Summary: Global analysis of T cell post-transcriptional regulatory elements  T cells are key cellular players of the immune system, and their activity is regulated by widespread modulation of gene expression. Genes are regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, but the post-transcriptional regulatory landscape is comparatively understudied. We propose to perform a global profiling of the post-transcriptional regulatory elements operating in T cells. To achieve this, we will use novel biochemical techniques to clone all protein-bound pieces of messenger RNAs in human T cells grown in vitro into libraries suitable for high throughput sequencing. We will compare this data set to comparable data from mouse T cells that we have already generated. For both of these data sets, we will proceed to functionally annotate the tens of thousands of protein binding sites in messenger RNAs for their effect on transcript stability and translational efficiency. To achieve this, we will clone libraries of these putative cis-regulatory elements into the 3? untranslated region of a heterologous reporter construct, and compare the relative stability and translation of reporter transcripts to measure the functional impact of each of protein binding sequences. These experiments will generate a transcriptome-wide map of active post-transcriptional cis-regulatory sequences in mouse and human T cells. In addition, we will mine these datasets with bioinformatic analyses to identify novel regulatory motifs associated with gene regulation in activated T cells or in specific T cell subsets, and to determine the evolutionary conservation of post-transcriptional regulatory sequences and mechanisms in mouse and human T cells. We expect this analysis to reveal generalizable information about the global mechanics of post-transcriptional gene regulation."
"9558897","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is the most common lung cancer of childhood, and usually the earliest indication of DICER1 syndrome; a genetic predisposition to early-onset embryonal tumors of multiple organ sites. The syndrome is defined by germline mutations in the DICER1 gene (OMIM #606241). In addition to PPB, the spectrum of syndromic neoplasias includes ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, cystic nephroma and renal sarcoma or Wilms tumor, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, nodular hyperplasia and carcinoma of the thyroid gland, nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma, pituitary blastoma and pineoblastoma. Early detection is imperative for survival in children with PPB. When discovered in its earliest, cystic stage, called Type I PPB, 91% of children diagnosed and treated for Type I PPB survive. The outcomes for children with cystic and solid (Type II) and purely solid (Type III) PPB are significantly worse despite surgery and intensive multidrug chemotherapy. About half of children with Type III PPB survive long-term. There are no effective treatments for refractory or recurrent disease. Late diagnosis and the resistance to therapy are the two major barriers to improving survivals of children with PPB. Genetic pathogenesis in DICER1 syndrome is unique, and it suggests a solution to the detection problems that hinder clinical management. From sequencing studies in over 200 cases of PPB and other DICER1 syndrome cancers, we know that virtually all carry a second DICER1 mutation, acquired somatically during early development. We propose to develop DICER-Dx, a panel of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays for the detection and quantification of DICER1 hotspot mutations, which are specifically, and invariably, associated with DICER1 syndrome cancers. DICER-Dx will be the first non- invasive biomarker assay for DICER1 syndrome cancers. It has the potential to transform standards of care for PPB and DICER1 syndrome by: 1) Improving the specificity and sensitivity of surveillance for tumor emergence in children at risk, while reducing or eliminating the need for CT scans and the attendant risks from radiation exposure and sedation; 2) Clarifying the differential diagnosis of Type I PPB vs. benign lung cysts discovered in imaging studies; 3) Guiding treatment decisions for children with PPB or other DICER1 syndrome tumors, e.g., whether or not adjuvant chemotherapy is needed after surgical removal of Type I PPB; 4) Monitoring for recurrence following chemotherapy; and 5) Evaluating tumor response to therapy. DICER-Dx may be useful not only in monitoring response to therapy in children with tumors, but also in preclinical mouse models. DICER1-Dx sample collection and testing will be an essential component of treatment and biology studies for the International PPB Registry."
"9502971","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for the Nova Southeastern University to serve as a clinical center for the Convergence  Insufficiency Treatment Trial - Attention and Reading Trial (CITT-ART), a multicenter randomized, placebo  controlled, clinical trial designed to evaluate the effects of treatment for symptomatic convergence  insufficiency (Cl) on measures of reading performance and attention in children. In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic Cl will be randomly assigned to 16 weeks of: 1) office-based vergence/ accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy. After 16 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome measures of reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-III]) reading comprehension subtest score and attention (Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]) will be assessed by examiners masked to treatment group. The Gates MacGinitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Reading fluency, another test of attention, the Cl Symptom Survey, and clinical measures of Cl (i.e., the near point of convergence, and positive fusional vergence at near) are other secondary outcome measures; also included are assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading comprehension including pseudo word decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension. Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention are assessed 1-year post treatment. This application documents our site's ability to recruit at least 36 subjects and to retain them for 1 year after completion of treatment. Documentation is provided that our site has the appropriate personnel, equipment, and facilities to conduct the study in accordance with the CITT-ART Manual of Procedures (MOP). Complete details of the study rationale, design, and methods are contained in the Manual of Procedures (submitted with the Study Chair and Data Coordinating Center [DCC] applications). In addition to our center, there are 8 other optometric or ophthalmologic centers, the Study Chair at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, and the DCC at The Ohio State University Optometry Coordinating Center. Symptomatic Cl is a common vision disorder in children that is commonly associated with symptoms while reading (e.g. loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading slowly, and trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of Cl treatment on reading and attention is unknown. The results of the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and have important implications for educators, psychologists, and physicians who care for children with reading and attention problems. The findings will guide hypothesis development for future scientific investigations in children with vision disorders."
"9481722","Pulmonary hypertension (PH) encompasses a diverse group of diseases marked by vascular injury and increased pulmonary artery pressures. Many sub-phenotypes of PH share a common link to the metabolic syndrome (systemic hypertension, obesity, glucose intolerance). For example, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and systemic hypertension are common risk factors for Group I pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) as well as for a subset of Group II (PH-heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, HF-pEF). The microbiome is important in development of obesity and the metabolic syndrome and is altered by high fat diet (HFD), suggesting that it may also play a role in PH. In Phase I of the tPPG, we tested 36 mouse strains and discovered that a 60% HFD led to PH HF-pEF, but only in certain strains. In our preliminary data, mice that developed PH on HFD had an increased ratio of gut Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, similar to changes in obese humans with metabolic syndrome. In contrast, mice that did not develop PH on a high fat diet had a stable ratio. When commensal bacteria were decreased by treating mice with broad-spectrum antibiotics during HFD, the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio increased further, and manifestations of PH worsened. Despite a growing literature implicating the microbiome in a wide range of diseases, these studies are the first to support a critical protective role of bacteria in PH. Oral bacteria are also crucial, given that they are required for enterosalivary conversion of dietary nitrate to nitrite. Lack of these bacteria could result in decreased nitrite availability and resultant loss of downstream reactions in the host such as generation of nitric oxide and lipid signaling mediators such as electrophilic nitro-fatty acid (NO2-FA), leading to vasoconstriction and vascular proliferation. Abolishing oral microbes leads to systemic hypertension, but effects on the pulmonary vasculature are unknown. Thus, the goal of Project 3 is to define the relationships between PH, high fat diet, the oral and gut microbiome, and the metabolism of nitrogen oxide signaling mediators that may regulate the development and severity of PH. Our overall hypothesis is that the commensal microbiome is beneficial in PH because of its function in bioactivation of the nitrate-nitrite-NO-NO2-FA pathway. This hypothesis will be tested in murine models and in PH patients with the following specific aims: Aim 1. Bench To test the hypothesis that bacteria are essential for nitrate (NO3-) reduction and NOx metabolism in animal models of PH. Aim 2. Bedside To determine epidemiological relationships of oral and gut microbial structure and function to PH in humans and test the specific hypothesis that the oral microbiome is critical for protective nitrate bioactivation and improves pulmonary hemodynamics. Successful completion will profoundly shift the current paradigm of PH and yield novel avenues for therapy. This innovative proposal will leverage resources established during Phase I of the tPPG and is highly synergistic with all Projects and Cores."
"9600499","Summary  Ail is a multifunctional surface protein required for virulence in Yersinia pestis, the etiological agent of plague. Ail confers serum-resistance, facilitates Type Three Secretion (T3S) of cytotoxins into host cells and mediates adhesion to host cells via extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. While Ail is required for Y. pestis virulence in animal models, it remains unclear which activities make major contributions to the establishment of plague. Our previous studies have defined the mechanism for Ail binding to host cells to provide Ail-mediated Yop delivery. While some such Ail mutants are nearly completely defective for Ail-mediated Yop delivery, they still impart strong serum resistance. In this proposal we will determine the mechanism(s) by which Ail confers serum resistance to Y. pestis. This involves investigating Ail interaction with various complement proteins involved in assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC) including C6-C9 and the complement regulatory proteins Factor H and vitronectin.  Using a newly generated serum-sensitive mutant of Ail that maintains Yop delivery activity, we will test the effects of serum-sensitive or adhesion/Yop delivery defective derivatives of Ail on plague pathogenesis in rats (rats are a good model for serum-related aspects of human disease). We hypothesize that loss of Ail- mediated cell binding or serum-resistance will lead to intermediate defects in host colonization, but loss of both activities will result in attenuation similar to a Dail mutant.  In all, this proposal focuses on the critical nature of interaction between Ail and the host. Specifically, we will establish the roles of Ail-mediated serum-resistance and adhesion/Yop translocation in plague pathogenesis, a longstanding challenge for the field."
"9541784","Project Summary Understanding the genetic basis of complex phenotypes is a critical problem in medical and evolutionary genetics. The evolutionary forces of natural selection and demography, including migration, have shaped patterns of worldwide genetic variation, which in turn have shaped the genetic architecture of human phenotypic variation. In the United States, population demography has changed immensely over the 20th century as a result of immigration and this will continue to be one of the primary modes of population growth as the US approaches a ?minority-majority? country. Hispanics/Latinos, the largest and fastest growing group, are a genetically heterogeneous population as result of admixture between African, European, and Native American populations. The effect of these large-scale migrations in contributing to shaping genetic variation and subsequently phenotypic variation is unknown. My preliminary data have shown how dynamic the admixture process has been in the US in the last century, demonstrating a crucial need to infer the demographic histories of these individuals. This proposal will use a combination of data analysis, population genetic modeling and statistical genetics to infer the migration histories of US Hispanics/Latinos and leverage their genetic ancestries to elucidate the genetic architecture of complex phenotypes. The long-term aim of this study is to improve our understanding of disease in Hispanic/Latino populations, which will hopefully lead to personalized medicine for a population that has been highly underrepresented in medical genetic studies."
"9473772","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visceral obesity associates with insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, which are major risk factors for the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Although the cellular hallmark of obesity is neutral lipid expansion in adipocytes, adipose tissue of obese mice and humans also accumulate macrophages and other leukocytes. It is well accepted that adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) play a critical role in systemic insulin resistance, suggesting that inflammatory mediators produced by ATMs are important factors linking excess fat mass to insulin sensitivity, glucose intolerance, and increased atherosclerotic risk. Pro-inflammatory pathways in ATMs are commonly attributed to classical activation (i.e. exposure to bacteria), thereby establishing molecular links between innate immunity and metabolic dysfunction. However, recent studies suggest that classical models fail to accurately represent the complex phenotype of ATMs in vivo, raising the possibility that inflammation in the context of metabolic disease is distinct from infection. We have exciting preliminary data that reconcile this complex phenotype and introduce a new mechanistic understanding of the pathways that drive ATM inflammation in metabolic disease. Using a proteomics approach we demonstrate that markers of classical activation are absent on ATMs from obese subjects, but readily detectable on airway macrophages of patients with cystic fibrosis, a disease of chronic bacterial infection. Moreover, treating human macrophages with glucose, insulin, and palmitate - conditions characteristic of the metabolic syndrome - produces a pro-inflammatory, `metabolically-activated' phenotype that is remarkably distinct from classical activation. Importantly, markers of metabolic activation are overexpressed by ATMs from obese subjects and correlate strongly with BMI. Furthermore, we provide evidence that similar pathways for metabolic activation are present in mouse macrophages in vitro and in ATMs from obese mice. Here we will test the hypothesis that metabolic disease-specific mechanisms drive adipose tissue macrophage inflammation, which in turn, promotes the development of insulin resistance. Specifically, we plan to 1) Dissect cellular mechanisms driving metabolic activation of macrophages in vitro, 2) Determine if metabolic activation causes ATM inflammation and insulin resistance in a mouse model of obesity-associated type 2 diabetes, and 3) Investigate relationships between metabolic activation of macrophages and insulin resistance in human subjects. By integrating mechanistic animal and cellular studies with human    observation, our proposed work will define clinically relevant pathways of macrophage inflammation. Understanding the mechanistic basis of the pro-inflammatory ATM phenotype and ATM function is required to devise new strategies for attenuating inflammation in metabolic disease."
"9467483","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An estimated 20% of the US population suffers from chronic pelvic pain, which encompasses a number of debilitating disorders including interstitial cystitis, irritable bowel syndrome, vulvodynia, chronic prostatitis and endometriosis, and costs more than $30 billion in direct medical and indirect costs annually. Up to 50% of women with chronic pelvic pain experience symptoms from more than one disorder, creating a greater negative impact on quality of life and complicating already less-than-optimal treatment strategies. Early life stress or trauma is a significant risk factor for developing functional pain disorders and is due, in part, to altered functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which regulates stress response and influences the perception of pain. Proper feedback within the hypothalamus, as well as regulatory input from higher limbic structures, influences the response to stress and subsequent return to homeostasis. Several key molecules are involved in this process, including corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), the principal initiator of the strss response through the CRF1 receptor; the related urocortins (Ucn), which can inhibit stress response through the CRF2 receptor; and glucocorticoids, which mediate downstream stress responses, as well as influence both positive and negative feedback onto the HPA axis. Rodent models of neonatal stress display disruption of proper feedback onto the HPA axis, resulting in visceral hyperalgesia, permanent changes in central and peripheral pain processing, and increased peripheral expression of inflammatory mediators. The goal of the current proposal is to understand how early life stress predisposes an individual to developing pelvic pain syndromes during adulthood. Our central hypothesis is that neonatal maternal separation (NMS) disrupts proper functioning of CRF-responsive brain regions and peripheral targets, resulting in altered bladder function and sensitivity, as well as enhanced susceptibility to stress-induced symptomology and comorbidity. We have designed three specific aims (SAs) to test this hypothesis. SA1 will determine the effect of neonatal and adult stress on limbic regulation of the HPA axis and downstream neurogenic inflammation of the bladder. SA2 will examine how neonatal and adult stress affects central and peripheral CRF/Ucn2-dependent control of micturition. SA3 will evaluate the efficacy of CRF antagonism for attenuating neonatal and adult stress-induced bladder dysfunction, hypersensitivity and neurogenic inflammation, as well as comorbid vaginal hypersensitivity. At the completion of this project, we will have gained new information about how early life stress drives neuronal plasticity, primes the nervous system for future insult, and increases the susceptibility for developing comorbid functional pain disorders. By focusing on stress-induced changes in visceral sensitivity, we will gain insight as to how best treat a specific subpopulation of patients suffering from IC, vulvodynia, and potentially a number of other comorbid stress-induced functional pain disorders."
"9508167","Project Summary / Abstract Strengths and weaknesses in non-social attention have been identified as among the earliest features that distinguish infants who develop autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and may play a critical role in the emergence of core ASD symptoms. The seemingly paradoxical co-existence of enhanced and impaired attentional abilities in ASD has thus far evaded scientific explanation. The locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system, which is known to play an important role in arousal regulation and selective attention, has been shown to function atypically in ASD. However, exactly how LC-NE activity relates to attentional strengths and weaknesses in ASD has not been determined. Thus, a critical gap remains in our knowledge of the neurofunctional mechanisms underlying these non-social attentional atypicalities. The objectives in this R21 application are to determine (1) relationship between attentional strengths and weaknesses and LC-NE activity in ASD, and (2) the neural circuits involved in these processes in ASD. The central hypothesis is that atypical function of the LC-NE system, as manifest through tonic and phasic activities, will correlate closely with enhanced visual search and inefficient attentional disengagement in ASD. The rationale for this research is that the ability to distinguish the underlying factors associated with attentional strengths and weaknesses in ASD can be expected to provide new insights into how lower-level attentional processes contribute to the emergence of higher-level sociocommunicative dysfunction in ASD, thus providing novel behavioral and/or pharmacological targets for intervention. We propose two specific aims: 1) Identify the relationship between attentional strengths and weaknesses and LC-NE activity in ASD; 2) Determine the extent of the association between the neurofunctional indices of attentional strengths and weaknesses and ASD symptom severity. Under the first aim, tonic and phasic indices of LC-NE activity (pupil dilation and P3 ERP amplitude) will be analyzed and related to behavioral and eye-tracking measures from visual search (strength) and gap-overlap (weakness) paradigms. Under the second aim, levels of symptom severity will be correlated with tonic and phasic activation of the LC-NE system. The approach is innovative because it will depart significantly from the status quo by examining strengths and weaknesses in parallel in a single cohort using a multimodal approach. Since processing strengths may be more likely to arise via a distinct mechanism and, therefore, should be more easily traced to their neurofunctional origin, investigating strengths and weaknesses in parallel will provide a more direct rendering of atypical brain architecture and neurocognitive function in ASD. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to lead to the identification of the neurofunctional mechanisms underlying these strengths and weaknesses. Such knowledge can be expected to provide insights into how these processes contribute to development of sociocommunicative deficits, and, ultimately inform early biomedical and behavioral markers and/or interventions that may ameliorate core symptoms of ASD."
"9500888","Abstract: Polyethylene glycol (PEG), due to its ability to resist protein adsorption and reduce RES clearance, has been widely used to extend the circulation times of protein and nanoparticle therapeutics. Unfortunately, recent animal and human studies have shown that anti-PEG antibodies (APA) can be either induced by select PEGylated therapeutics, or are pre-existing, presumably due to constant exposure to PEG in everyday hygiene, skincare and food products. In turn, APA can substantially limit the circulation kinetics of PEGylated therapeutics and render them non-efficacious, and potentially even unsafe. In light of the increasing number of PEGylated therapeutics that are either FDA approved or in clinical development, there is an urgent need for interventions that can enable the use of PEGylated drugs in patients with high APA titers. Here, by combining physiology-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling with a series of in vitro and in vivo studies, we have identified administration of high MW free-PEG to be a simple, effective and safe strategy in blocking APA binding to PEGylated therapeutics. Indeed, injection of free-PEG increased the fraction of circulating PEGylated liposomes in mice with substantial levels of APA by >100-fold compared to PBS control, reaching levels identical to mice without APA. More importantly, all toxicity studies of this intervention, including complete blood counts, liver and renal functions as well as careful tissue histology, were indistinguishable from PBS control and showed no evidence of glomeruli inflammation. The surprising, complete lack of toxicity appears related to the highly flexible nature of PEG coupled to the absence of PEG anchoring to substrates with fixed conformations, which limits the formation of immune complexes and triggering conventional effector functions. To realize the full potential of this strategy, we propose a rigorous research program that combines in silico, in vitro and in vivo approaches to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the use of free-PEG in mice with high titers of APA for two PEGylated therapeutics, Krystexxa (PEG-uricase for treatment of gout) and Onivyde (PEGylated liposomal irinotecan for treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas). In Aim 1, we will further develop our PBPK model to guide the optimization of use of free PEG (PEG MW, dose, dosing regimen, etc) to suppress APA, and to predict the effectiveness of this intervention in both mice and humans. In Aim 2, we will verify the predictions from Aim 1 for restoring prolonged circulation of Krystexxa in mouse with APA titers matching those found in humans through a series of carefully designed pharmacokinetic, biodistribution and toxicity studies. Finally, in Aim 3, we will verify the predictions from Aim 1 for restoring the effectiveness of Onivyde in a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer with APA. If successful, our work will identify a readily translatable pathway for restoring the use of a variety of PEGylated agents in patients with high titers of APA."
"9586118","Project summary In nature, bacteria often form complex communities that enable them to adapt to their environment and to carry out particular functions. For example, the community of bacteria in the human gut in uences a variety of aspects of health and disease, while some infections are characterized by the formation of lms of living cells (bio lms). These bio lms have been extensively investigated in medical and industrial contexts, but the biophysical rules underlying these living communities have remained unclear.  To close this gap, the proposed investigations will develop genetic constructs, bacterial strains, visu- alization tools, and biophysical models in order to set the stage for the rational engineering of complex microbial communities that carry out de ned functions. Speci cally, the investigators propose to (1) develop quantitative experimental tools to optically pattern single-species and multispecies bio lms; and (2) through biophysical modeling and experimentation, investigate the structural development of ecolog- ically interacting consortia from initial seeding. Critically, the proposed investigations will establish and validate a new platform, bio lm lithography, that will enable major advances in the use of optogenetics and synthetic biology for bioengineering, research and therapeutic purposes.  This broadly applicable platform will answer two pairs of crucial questions in the proposed inves- tigations. 1a) Can the light-activated expression of bio lm genes yield robust, high-resolution spatial patterning of bio lms on a 2D surface? 1b) Can the platform be used to control multiple genes and populations in parallel by using multichromatic light stimuli? 2a) Can these tools be used to generate, study, and understand stable, spatially patterned multispecies bio lm consortia? 2b) Are experimental measurements of bio lm dynamics supported by quantitative biophysical models?  Taken together, the combination of theory and experiment proposed here will set the stage for the plug-and-play design of microbial communities with both complex structure and function. These advances will signi cantly lower access barriers to complex synthetic biology, driving innovation across elds as well as across socioeconomic divisions. When coupled with the future rational design of cellular genomes and structures, our platform for the construction and manipulation of light-patterned living communities has the potential to signi cantly advance medicine and also material sciences."
"9519603","ABSTRACT  Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is one of the Neglected Tropical Diseases. But TBRF's distribution extends beyond the tropical regions to most of the rest of the world. Sylvan life cycles, comprising tick vectors and mammalian reservoirs, also exist in several areas in North America. Most human cases of relapsing fever in North America are from Borrelia hermsii, whose endemic foci mainly are coniferous forests in mountainous areas. In comparison to the related agents of Lyme disease, little is known about the population biology and genetics of TBRF agents. The conceptual entry point for this 2-year, small grant project is the null hypothesis is that these two groups of tick-borne spirochetes have similar population structures, namely, multiple strains, with the predominant strain a plurality, not a majority. Investigations carried out on the collected B. hermsii will also advance understanding of the evolution of antigenic variation of multiple, highly-polymorphic proteins (VMPs). Other expected benefits include estimates of effective population size of B. hermsii, characterization of the population genetics of the tick vector Ornithodoros hermsi and its Coxiella sp. endosymbiont, and survey of rodents for infection with B. hermsii.  The 2-year small grant project combines field work and laboratory studies. It leverages the experience and resources of the PI's laboratory with the field expertise and resources of the study's collaborators. Field studies will be at two sites of the University of California's Natural Reserve System. These sites represent isolated mountain niches, or sky islands. At the sites, ticks will be systematically collected, using an innovative approach, from burrows and nests of chipmunks and squirrels. Personnel of the California Department of Public Health will trap and bleed rodents as part of their routine surveillance for zoonoses. The laboratory studies entail (i) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of DNA extracted from ticks, as well as samples of rodent blood provided by CDPH, (ii) serology of rodent blood, (iii) genome sequencing of selected isolates, and (iv) phylogenetic and population genetic analysis.  Aim 1: Population structure of Borrelia hermsii at two ?sky island? sites in California with recent human cases of relapsing fever. Systematic collection of O. hermsi ticks from field sites in the White-Inyo Mountains and Sierra Nevada Mountains, followed by (a) determination of the prevalence of B. hermsii in the ticks by PCR and by injection of laboratory mice and (b) serology for evidence of present or past infection of wild rodents. Identified B. hermsii in ticks or rodents will be genotypes by MLST.  Aim 2: Population genetics of B. hermsii and evolution of its VMP genes. Genome sequencing of B. hermsii, genotyping of O. hermsi ticks, and genotyping of the Coxiella sp. endosymbiont. Estimates of effective population size, analysis for evidence of selection and recombination in VMP genes, studies of the population structures of O. hermsi ticks and the Coxiella sp. endosymbiont, and initial estimates of rates of evolution."
"9510251","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Identifying predictors and indicators of emerging mental illness is a high public health priority. Early intervention will be most effectively implemented if we know who and what to target. Current predictors and risk calculators consist of static measures such as sociodemographics, symptom levels, and cognitive functioning. Yet substantial evidence suggests that the emergence of mental illness occurs in a dynamic interaction with the environment, with both continuity and discontinuity of symptoms over time, and that subtle changes precede most acute episodes. The earliest symptoms are often ?nonspecific? as they are precursors to a range of diagnostic outcomes and trajectories. Although there are significant efforts to capture dynamic genetic, structural, electrophysiological, and other brain-based and biological changes accompanying the onset of psychosis, there has been very little characterization of symptom dynamics predicting clinical course, including the temporal sequencing of symptoms during the early phases of major mental illness. The proposed project is a preliminary step in a line of research intended to address this gap of knowledge.  The study uses a strategy designed for collecting dynamic data, Experience Sampling Methods (ESM), in a high priority population: adolescents and young adults at elevated risk for psychosis or within the initial five years following a first episode of psychosis (FEP). The aim is to measure a novel target for this population, temporal variability in affect, and examine its relationship to symptoms of particular relevance to poorer outcomes: psychotic-spectrum symptoms and thoughts of self-harm. The proposed study is designed to test initial hypotheses that greater affect variability will be associated with elevations in these symptoms and to explore the potential roles of age and social context in these dynamics. These preliminary data are expected to inform a highly promising line of research into dynamic predictors of critical events and transitions during the early course of major mental illness, features that may also predict long-term trajectories. Early course symptom dynamics are also expected to inform both the understanding of mechanisms of illness progression and novel, including personalized and mobile, interventions to interrupt pathological sequences and improve functional outcomes. Thus the goals of this proposal are consistent with the R21 guidelines emphasizing novelty and innovation, as well as NIMH strategic objectives to chart mental illness trajectories to identify when, where, and how to intervene, and to identify clinically useful dimensions of behavior and behavioral predictors of change."
"9570706","PROJECT SUMMARY  Latino youth are a population at risk for chronic diseases because of their growing overweight and obesity rates, lack of adherence to nutrition and physical activity recommendations, and greater rates of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs use than youth of other ethnic groups. Parents are an important agent of change for youth due to their ability to create a home environment that promotes healthful behaviors (including substance use prevention and healthy nutrition), and parents' role as providers of resources to the family (including food). Parenting interventions are efficacious in preventing substance use among Latino youth, but few studies have used a family approach to promote healthy nutrition. Thus, the overall objective of the proposed project is to extend the scope of Families Preparing the New Generation (FPNG), an existing parenting program proven to help reduce substance use among Latino youth, to also promote healthy nutrition. The ecodevelopmental perspective will provide the theoretical foundation for the project for investigating risk and resiliency in Latino youth's drug use and nutrition behaviors. Our main aims are to (1) test the effects of a nutrition-enhanced parenting program (FPNG+) on substance use and nutrition among Latino youth, (2) explore how enhancing parenting skills impact the effects of the enhanced intervention, and (3) understand how social and cultural factors impact how the enhanced program works. We will first seek input from community members to create a nutrition-enhanced program that is acceptable to Latino parents of middle school students. We will then collaborate with the American Dream Academy (ADA), an organization delivering an academic success program to families within middle schools throughout the Phoenix Area, to recruit 1,494 families who have a student in 7th grade to participate in the study. Parents from different schools will be offered one of three 10- week programs (assigned to each individual school): FPNG+ (substance use prevention and healthy nutrition), FPNG (substance use prevention only), and the ADA comparison program (focusing on academic success). We will collect data from the 7th grade student and his/her participating parent before the start of the program, immediately after it ends, and 16 weeks later, to compare how the programs affect nutrition, substance use, and parenting. In a subgroup of 126 families (42 from each program), we will explore how the FPNG+ program affects diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors and whether the program induces changes in the types of foods available at participants' homes. For this, we will collect capillary blood samples from participants to measure glycosylated hemoglobin (a marker of diabetes risk) and cholesterol (a marker of cardiovascular risk), and blood pressure, as well as a list of foods that participants have at home. Our long-term goal is to design and disseminate programs that contribute to helping parents assist their adolescent children develop and maintain long-lasting positive lifestyle behaviors in order to prevent substance use and chronic diseases."
"9579669","Project Summary Loss-of-function mutations and suppression of innate antiviral proteins, such as OAS2 and OASL are associated with high viral infection rates in mice and humans. Because of their induction by interferons, these antiviral proteins are often referred to as interferon-stimulated genes (ISG). While recombinant interferon stimulates production of these antiviral proteins, type I interferon?s severe toxicity is the major limitation in its therapeutic utility. Additionally, pharmacological antivirals, such as acyclovir, have a high risk for triggering neutropenia and nephrotoxicity in vulnerable patient populations. Therefore, there is a significant unmet clinical need for new antiviral therapeutics. This need can be addressed by developing a full understanding of interferon-independent regulation of endogenous antiviral proteins and identifying targets for therapy and prevention by activation of this incredibly potent natural antiviral pathway. Our proposed work will answer important question: 1) Which interferon-independent signals and pathways can induce antiviral competence? 2) Does epithelial antiviral innate immunity differ on a single cell level? 3) What factors collaborate in the induction of innate antiviral immunity?"
"9503190","Episode-based (?bundled?) approaches have been promoted for performance measurement to encourage shared accountability for the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery among all of the providers involved in a patient's care. Most episode-based pilot programs use relatively narrow episode definitions, with the typical episode trigger starting at the time of a hospitalization or surgery. However, little attention has been paid to measuring quality and value of pre-surgical care. Although inpatient and postoperative care are costly, outpatient care accounts for the greatest utilization of health care resources in terms of visits and expenditures. This pre-surgical period, during which patients often have multiple touches with the healthcare system, is an important time to identify opportunities to improve coordination and quality of care for Veterans. The studies proposed as part of this CDA will facilitate development of innovative strategies to improve coordination, access, and value of care for Veterans with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), particularly in the pre- surgical period. Treatment for CTS is an ideal context to develop measurement models of care quality and utilization between primary care and specialty providers, given that approximately 40,000 Veterans per year are newly diagnosed with CTS and often receive care from one or more providers from primary care, occupational therapy, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery, neurosurgery, physical medicine and rehabilitation, or pain management. Although a variety of nonoperative treatments can be appropriate under certain clinical circumstances, these same treatments can be low value if they lead to delays for patients who would benefit from surgery. This series of studies to evaluate and improve quality and utilization of CTS pre-surgical care will advance an understanding of how to optimize coordination of patient-centered surgical care more broadly. This project will have 3 aims: Aim 1: Using VHA national data, facility-level variation in CTS pre-surgical value will be assessed by examining both quality/access (inappropriate delay of surgery) and resource utilization (number of pre-surgical encounters), while evaluating the impact of key structural and process variables, including referral to community providers. Aim 2: Semi-structured interviews with patients and clinicians will be conducted to further identify and better understand factors associated with pre-surgical episode quality and utilization. Clinicians and patients will be recruited from 2 facilities with the highest and 2 facilities with the lowest performance on both pre-surgical measures (quality and utilization) to evaluate perspectives, preferences, organizational factors, and care goals of key stakeholders (patients and providers) who impact decision-making across phases of pre-surgical CTS care. Aim 3: Findings from Aim 1 and Aim 2 will be used to design and pilot a multi-disciplinary CTS clinical care pathway that addresses systemic barriers and processes impacting pre-surgical episode quality/access and utilization of CTS-related care provided across primary care and specialty clinics. Pilot testing will assess the intervention's feasibility, acceptability, and potential to improve facility-level pre-surgical episode value in preparation for an anticipated randomized trial. These methods, refined for CTS, will be applied in future work to examine variation in quality and utilization of pre-surgical care for other conditions, with the goal of optimizing use of health care services and maximizing outcomes for Veterans who receive surgical care. In anticipation of greater Veteran access to community- based care, this initiative will also be beneficial for monitoring and better coordinating the quality and value of care across diverse healthcare settings."
"9488772","MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY (MO) RESEARCH PROGRAM PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Molecular Oncology (MO) Research Program is the basic science backbone of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC). The program is home to diverse groups of basic scientists with a wide spectrum of interests that encompass contemporary cancer research. The exceptional expertise in the Program ranges from fundamental cell signaling mechanisms, to structural elucidation of macromolecules, to cancer stem cell biology and DNA damage response, tumor microenvironments, and nationally recognized disease-specific groups in brain tumors and breast cancer. The Program's overarching goal is to elucidate fundamental mechanisms of oncogenesis, encompassing the general themes of cancer stem cell regulation, DNA damage and repair, and host-tumor interactions. This is organized around 3 scientific aims: (1) Discover cancer stem cell mechanisms for cancer prevention and treatment; (2) Identify how defective DNA damage repair promotes genomic instability and alters therapeutic response and, (3) Reveal key host-tumor interactions that promote tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. These aims support the key function of the MO program to serve as an incubator to develop and nurture new research initiatives expected to mature into new research themes within the Center. The major working groups and initiatives that coalesces program members with other cancer center investigators through interprogrammatic collaborations that result in preclinical and clinical research efforts, grants, and trial protocols. Extensive use of an array of shared resources, in particular Cytometry, Imaging, Tissue Resources, Proteomics, and Biostatistics facilitate all aspects of member discoveries. Under the leadership of Alex Almasan (Co-Leader) and Bing-Cheng Wang (Co-Leader) the MO Program has 53 members including 44 full, 8 associate, and 1 clinical member. Members represent 18 departments and are funded with a total of $14.7M in annual research grant direct costs, $14.2M of which is peer-reviewed and $6.7M NCI-funded. Between 2012 and 2016, MO program members published 716 publications. Cancer and program related publications included 37% inter-programmatic, 19% intra-programmatic, 9% inter- and intra- programmatic and 7% that involved collaborations with another cancer center. This highly effective program has made major advances to contemporary cancer research. Examples include: discovery that glioblastoma stem cells generate vascular pericytes to support vessel function and tumor growth; elucidation that the mitotic kinesin KIF11 is a driver of invasion, proliferation, and self-renewal in glioblastoma; identification of the revealed preferential iron trafficking in glioblastoma stem-like cells; examination of the control of meiotic pairing and recombination by chromosomally tethered 26S proteasome; and the discovery that glioblastoma stem cells secrete periostin to recruit tumor-associated macrophages."
"9481672","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to further my development as a clinical investigator and support the training of future physician-scientists. With the support of this grant, I will continue to focus my efforts on designing and implementing individualized mentoring plans in the context of improving our understanding of bone biology and osteoporosis therapy. The mentoring plans, while targeted to each trainee's experience level, consist of didactic training, participation and integration into the Endocrine Unit's rich research environment, and the supervised completion of a novel and impactful project. The outstanding training environment of the Massachusetts General Hospital Endocrine Unit and the significant support of the Endocrine Unit leadership further strengthen this application. The clinical investigation techniques and procedures described in this proposal are novel, clinically relevant, and provide current and future trainees with opportunities to gain experience in all aspects of clinical trial implementation. Furthermore, our studies utilize the most innovative and exciting methods available in bone-related human investigation. Specifically, our experience with high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography allows us to move beyond standard measurements of bone mineral density to investigate the effects of interventions on bone geometry, structure and microarchitecture while our utilization of finite element analysis allows for the longitudinal evaluation of estimated bone strength at the most clinically relevant sites. Finally, our capacity to measure bone material properties in vivo using the recently-introduced microindentation technique allows for the direct determination of cortical bone material strength. This award will permit me to substantially decrease my clinical and administrative duties and expand my mentoring responsibilities. Moreover, it will allow me to continue to direct clinical studies with the potential to significantly improve the management of patients with severe osteoporosis."
"9586213","Project Summary Kinase mediated tyrosine phosphorylation is a crucial component of cellular signaling cascades. Precise regulatory control over kinase activity must be maintained during signaling as evidenced by numerous human diseases that arise upon dysregulation of protein kinases. Given the crucial role of kinases in cell signaling, these enzymes are key targets in treating disease. Traditional approaches for therapeutic targeting of kinases have involved small molecules that exert their effect directly on the kinase active site. The increasing instances of resistance to such drugs suggest a need for devising new ways to target kinase activity. One way to accomplish this goal is to better understand the structural features of specific kinases as they transition between autoinhibited to activated states. In our work on the Tec family tyrosine kinases (immunological kinases involved in signaling downstream of antigen receptors), we have identified a completely new structural form of Bruton?s tyrosine kinase (BTK); an enzyme required for B cell development and function. The current application lays out aims to fully characterize the multimerized BTK structure observed by single particle electron microscopy. To carry out the proposed work we have established strong collaborations with Dipali Sashital at ISU and Bridget Carragher & Clint Potter at the National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy (NRAMM). We anticipate that successful completion of the proposed studies will not only open new avenues to target BTK but will also add to the growing understanding of the role of higher order complexes that control B cell signaling."

The proposed training program, which builds on a >20-year history of collaboration in HIV/AIDS-related research and training between these institutions, will target junior investigators who are based at MAKCHS or affiliated non-governmental organizations and aspire to careers in patient-oriented research. The current renewal seeks to enhance opportunities in translational and implementation research, which have been identified by Ugandan and U.S. investigators as a critical under- represented need in Makerere's efforts to become an internationally recognized center of excellence for HIV- related lung disease research. By offering didactic training and practical research experiences with established HIV/AIDS investigators in externally funded projects, the program will prepare individuals from diverse professional backgrounds to contribute to translational and implementation research teams. This team-building strategy represents an efficient and forward-thinking approach to advancing research in the important, under- studied, and inherently inter-disciplinary content areas of TB and other pulmonary complications of HIV. Trainees will be enrolled in master's and doctoral degree programs and pre-doctoral research fellowships at MAKCHS, with their training supplemented by online coursework at external partner institutions, short international training visits for advanced courses and intensive laboratory experiences not available at MAKCHS. We will also offer advanced workshops and fellowships in implementation science in an executive- style educational format designed to accommodate busy junior faculty, post-doctoral fellows, and public health specialists working with implementing partners. All trainees will receive scientific and career mentoring through an individual research advisory committee and regular meetings with the program directors. The result of the training program will be an increase in the capacity of MAKCHS for conducting high-quality, locally relevant, and internationally recognized research on TB and other pulmonary complications of HIV. In turn, this will help improve HIV/AIDS outcomes in Uganda and other high-burden countries and develop the next generation of researchers."
"9482420","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program."
"9452746","PROJECT SUMMARY A key question in neurobiology is how individual neurons precisely connect with each other to form functional circuits during development. Understanding the mechanisms of neural circuit assembly in the mammalian brain may provide insights into the etiology of human brain disorders. In the mammalian brain, each neuron on average forms connection with thousands of other neurons. The assembly of these complex circuits depends on cell-cell communication during many steps of neural development. In the previous two cycles of this grant, we have focused on developing MADM (Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers) in mice. MADM labels with two distinct colors isolated individual neurons or groups of neurons that share a common lineage. At the same time, MADM can render neurons labeled with one of the colors homozygous mutant for a gene of interest and neurons labeled with the second color wild type as internal controls. MADM has allowed researchers to examine gene function in mammalian neural development (as well as other processes) with single-cell resolution, and enabled many new discoveries. In this renewal, we will utilize MADM and other tools we have developed in the previous grant cycles to study cell-cell communications in neural circuit assembly in the mouse brain. Specifically, we focus on two classes of proteins: neurotrophin receptors and teneurins.  Using MADM analysis of the neurotrophin receptor TrkC, we have previously shown that sparse but not global knockout of TrkC in Purkinje cells reduces dendritic growth and branching, suggesting a competitive mechanism for dendrite morphogenesis. We will investigate the cellular mechanisms by which TrkC-mediated competitive dendrite morphogenesis using in vivo imaging, test whether postsynaptic activity required for Purkinje cell dendrite development, and the relationship between activity and TrkC signaling. We will also explore the function of neurotrophin receptor TrkB in neuronal morphogenesis. From our studies in Drosophila olfactory circuit assembly, we identified two teneurins, which are evolutionally conserved type II transmembrane proteins, that instruct synaptic partner matching via homophilic attraction. We will test whether teneurins also mediate cell-cell interaction in neural circuit assembly in the mouse brain using a combination of MADM analysis, conditional knockout, virus-mediated misexpresssion, and in vitro assays.  "
"9481349","PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to develop commercial 18F PET radiopharmaceuticals for evaluating the proportion of D2 receptors in the high affinity state in human diseases, including Parkinson?s disease and restless legs syndrome. The D2high receptor is the functional form of the D2 receptor to which endogenous dopamine binds. An agonist radioligand should be more sensitive to endogenous DA levels than antagonist radioligands since, unlike antagonists, agonist radioligands bind preferentially to the receptor in its high affinity state. Thus, agonist radioligands have the potential to elucidate more detailed information on receptor subtype activity as a function of disease as well as DA system activity as a whole. The majority of known radioligands are based on D2 antagonists and, as such, do not specifically target the D2high state. Among the known agonist ligands, none possess high selectivity for D2 over D3, and more importantly, none of the agonist ligands have been successfully developed as 18F PET radioligands. Indeed, the development of an effective 18F-labeled D2 agonist radioligand has proven challenging, and there are no commercially available agonist PET radioligands for measuring D2 function in the brain. In contrast, fluoroaporphines, which are the focus of this project, are fluorinated D2 receptor agonists that specifically and selectively target D2high receptors in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the objective of this project is to carry out the necessary preclinical evaluations in order to file an investigational new drug application (IND) and develop the fluoroaporphines as commercial 18F PET radiopharmaceuticals to aid in the diagnosis of dopamine-dependent disorders. The D2 agonist 18F PET radioligands will be used for: a) for early diagnosis of PD/LBD and RLS b) as a diagnostic biomarker in clinical trials, to measure the efficacy of medications being developed for  PD, RLS, and other disorders involving the dysfunction of the dopaminergic system Such radioligands will be a superior tool for in vivo evaluation of the human brain, for earlier diagnosis of disease, and will foster the development of more targeted and effective therapies for PD, RLS, schizophrenia, addiction, and other neuropsychiatric disorders involving the D2high receptor. Such radioligands will have a widespread and positive impact on public health worldwide. These18F radiopharmaceuticals will have a positive impact on patients? lives by providing a way to get a correct diagnosis earlier and therefore obtain appropriate treatment earlier, and in turn by lowering the overall socio-economical burden to the patients and their families."
"9476200","Core D: Neuropathology Project Summary/Abstract Neuropathology is essential to identify the true causes of brain disease. Although biomarkers are increasingly valuable as harbingers of disease in presymptomatic stages, there remains a need to validate CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers. In the older brain, more than one disease often is at work and at present only a detailed neuropathologic examination can determine the presence of coexisting diseases which may contribute in complex ways to the progression to dementia. Thus, the Neuropathology Core is essential for the ADRC to achieve its stated goals. Specifically, The Neuropathology Core has the following aims: Aim 1: To make neuropathologic diagnoses on all new brain accessions from ADRC research participants using standard diagnostic criteria. Aim 2: To perform brain autopsies and to collect, store, and distribute formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and frozen brain tissue samples to support ADRC projects and investigators and outside collaborations that enhance ADRC research goals. Aim 3: To develop and maintain a computerized neuropathology database (CaTissue) in concert with the Data Management and Biostatistics Core (Core C) and the Clinical Core (Core B). Another interaction of the Neuropathology Core with the Clinical Core is to work closely with the Clinical Core autopsy coordinator, who is instrumental in arranging autopsy permission and in making arrangements for the body once death has occurred. This includes transporting the body to WUSM for autopsy. Aim 4: To support Project 2 (Aim 3), Core D will provide clinically and neuropathologically well-characterized cases of AD with and without Lewy bodies to determine how Aß and ?-synuclein compete for clearance pathways. Aim 5: To support Project 1 (Aim 2C) Core D will quantify the molecular pathology (tauopathy and  ß-amyloidosis) in those participants who have undergone 18F-T807tau and 18F-florbetapir amyloid imaging who have come to autopsy in order to correlate PET amyloid and tau data with lesion number and density in histological sections of brain-matched areas."
"9473022","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will test the long-term impact of the Family Check-Up (FCU) approach to preventing substance use and other high-risk problem behaviors from toddlerhood through adolescence by enhancing parenting. A critical question for a randomized prevention trial such as this is the extent to which early family support reduces adolescent alcohol and drug use (ADU), high-risk sexual behavior linked to HIV-AIDS, and serious problem behaviors in adolescence. The study also will examine how reduction in these adolescent problem behaviors is mediated by improvement in parenting and peer environments and is moderated by the family ecology and genetic risk. The proposed study will include follow-up assessments of 731 children through adolescence that include the collection of DNA; observations of family interaction; parent, youth and teacher report of adjustment; and assessments of and reports about peer environments. The Early Steps (ES) multisite sample was recruited from WIC centers in three geographically, socioeconomically, and ethnically diverse communities: Pittsburgh, PA; Charlottesville, VA; and Eugene, OR. To increase the number of sample families at risk for later ADU, eligibility was restricted to WIC families with additional socioeconomic (i.e., low parental education), family (i.e., maternal stress), and child (i.e., toddler conduct problems) risk factors. The children and families were initially assessed at child age 2 and then yearly through age 10.5, using a multi-agent and multi-method strategy that included direct observations of family interaction in most years. Families were randomly assigned to be offered a yearly FCU intervention, including adapted and tailored family management interventions. Specifically, the Family Check-Up will be evaluated as it relates to reducing adolescent substance use, high-risk sexual behavior linked to HIV, and other serious problem behavior at ages 14 and 16, how such intervention effects might be mediated by changes in parenting, and moderated by neighborhood adversity and GxE interactions."
"9480860","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have led to unprecedented resolution for native-state (unfixed, unstained) macromolecules and cells. Amino-acid side-chains can now be identified in maps of isolated macromolecules, without the need for crystallization. The in-situ shapes of important macromolecules within cells, and their cellular interaction, can now be studied at down to 8.5 Å resolution by cryo-EM tomography. These advances promise insight into details of cellular and molecular function that have never before been accessible, advancing all fields of biomedical research; NIH has recognized their importance by a new RFA (GM-16-001) that aims to widen access to this technology. However, current enthusiasm will wane with the realization that the full promise of this technology is currently only achieved for certain macromolecules or cell types. The PI's lab focuses on two projects that will widen applicability of advanced cryo-EM: (1) cryo-EM phase-plate imaging and (2) cryo-focused-ion-beam (cryo-FIB) preparation for cryo-EM tomography.  The highest resolution in cryo-EM of isolated macromolecules requires molecules of sufficient size (> ca. 100 kDa), limited flexibility, ideally with some symmetry, and which form a fairly homogenous population. Without increasing electron-beam damage, phase-plate imaging greatly improves contrast, so that adequate selection, sorting, and alignment of particles can be accomplished, using fewer total particles. This will take us along the last mile to a wider application of the improved single-particle approach. We will continue to evaluate a wide variety of phase-shifting devices, and improve their use in a variety of real-world situations.  The highest resolution for in-situ macromolecules is achieved by cryo-EM tomography followed by sub-tomogram averaging of molecular motifs. Samples must be thin; flat-cultured cells were previously examined only at their margins. For cells in tissue, cryo-ultramicrotomy, a difficult and artifact-prone technique, was the only choice. We introduced cryo-FIB milling, which can facilitate high-resolution results with all cell types. But in spite of recent progress, this remains an extremely difficult technique, so far implemented in only very few labs in the world. In addition, targeting specific sub-cellular structures is problematical. Ifthe promise of cryo-FIB milling for cryo-EM tomography is to be realized, it must be refined to widen its applicability and make it easier to use. Cryo-EM tomography will also greatly benefit from cryo-EM phase-plate imaging; better contrast will improve tilt-series and sub-tomogram alignment accuracy, and will reveal weak fine structure.  Our lab has built up world-class instrumentation and infrastructure specific to our projects (likely unmatched elsewhere), and we have personnel with many years of experience in advancing cutting-edge biological electron microscopy. With funding via the MIRA concept, we aim to bring our current projects to full fruition, while remaining in a position to follow exciting new developments."
"9453919","ABSTRACT Trypanosomatid parasites cause some of the most challenging neglected diseases worldwide. The human- pathogenic triumvirate of Trypanosoma brucei spp., Trypanosome cruzi, and Leishmania spp. sickening hundreds of thousands of individuals, causing human African trypanosomiasis, Chagas' disease, and a range of visceral to cutaneous lesions, respectively. However, there are no approved vaccines and treatments are difficult due to side-effects, resistance, and regimens that are unsuitable for resource-limited settings. Therefore, discovery of new drugs is critical for therapy, control, and elimination of these diseases. We have recently shown that the protein kinase, AEK1, which is both highly conserved in these agents yet different from human protein kinases, is essential in the pathogenic bloodstream stage of T. brucei in vitro. We have also chemically validated it as important during infection. To discover T. brucei AEK1 inhibitors we will screen well- curated, focused kinase libraries against the purified enzyme, counterscreening against the closest human paralog, with subsequent testing of compounds on cultured bloodstream stage T. brucei. Such compounds will serve as a starting point for future work to develop drugs for treatment and eradication of human African trypanosomiasis. Surprisingly, few drug targets have been validated across pathogenic trypanosomatid species, despite their closely related proteomes. Therefore, we will test whether AEK1 could serve as a pan- trypanosomatid drug target by determining whether it is essential in the pathogenic stages of Leishmania donovani, and through collaboration, T. cruzi. If so, we will quantify activity of the discovered inhibitors against the L. donovani and T. cruzi enzymes and against L. donovani amastigotes. The results will inform us as to whether AEK1 is a suitable drug target for multiple parasite species, which would leverage future medicinal chemistry aimed at enhancing selectivity, efficacy and bioavailability of compounds identified in this project."
"9477752","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease is highly prevalent among HIV-infected patients, however the distinct mechanisms of atherosclerotic disease development in HIV-infected patients are yet unknown. Chronic HIV infection is associated with loss of gastrointestinal mucosal epithelial integrity and loss of CD4+ T-cells in the intestinal lamina propria, leading to increased microbial translocation across the gastrointestinal tract. The key hypothesis of this grant application is that microbial translocation causes activation of the innat immune system which can induce inflammatory damage in the vasculature, leading to cardiovascular disease. Aim 1 seeks to study the relationships of intestinal epithelial integrity and microbial translocation to monocyte and macrophage activation and to cardiovascular risk measured by arterial inflammation via FDG-PET (to assess arterial macrophage activity) and coronary cardiac computed tomography angiography (to assess coronary atherosclerotic plaque quantitatively and qualitatively). Transcriptomic analyses in monocytes are proposed to identify novel biological pathways of atherogenesis in HIV-infected patients. To further test the central hypothesis, an interventional study is proposed in Aim 2 to improve the gut epithelial integrity and reduce microbial translocation in order to test effects of such an intervention on cardiovascular inflammation and monocyte function. The intervention of teduglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 2 analog with known trophic and anti-inflammatory effects on the intestinal epithelium, will be investigated in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled proof of concept trial in HIV-infected individuals. The hypothesis to be tested is that improvement of gut epithelial integrity will decrease intestinal permeability to microbial products, thus decreasing te stimulus for monocyte and macrophage activation, and therefore decrease macrophage activity in the arterial wall measured by FDG-PET and reduce overall cardiovascular risk."
"9477590","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term goal of this project is to understand the molecular mechanisms that control biomineralization. We originally identified Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) a noncollagenous protein in odontoblasts and later in osteoblasts. Numerous studies by us and others suggest that DMP1 might play critical roles in the biomineralization process. Recently we discovered that DMP1 can stimulate the release of intracellular calcium in preosteoblasts and preodontoblasts. To refill the ER, plasma membrane Ca 2+ channels need to be activated to permit Ca 2+ entry from the extracellular space. The molecular mechanism by which DMP1 stimulation leads to store depletion and subsequent opening of Ca2+ permeable ion channels namely store-operated calcium channels are not known. Therefore, understanding how DMP1 mediates intracellular calcium release and influx is a new concept. Store operated calcium entry (SOCE) is a principal cellular process by which cells regulate basal Ca2+, refill intracellular Ca2+ and execute a wide range of specialized activities. We also identified two DMP1 interacting proteins, namely, GRP-78 (Glucose-regulated protein- 78) and TRIP-1 (TGF-beta receptor II interacting protein 1). Both GRP-78 and TRIP-1 are ER resident proteins. Thus, the epicenter for DMP1 stimulation is the endoplasmic reticulum. The unifying hypothesis of this proposal is that the release of intracellular Ca2+ by DMP1 stimulation regulates a wide range of cellular functions including osteoblast and odontoblast survival and differentiation. The result wil generate new information that is relevant to understanding molecular mechanisms that control mineralization in bone and dentin. Currently, no channel molecule has been exploited for either therapy or diagnosis of mineralization related disorders. Therefore, the outcomes from this study will help define potential therapeutic targets for bone and dentin repair and regeneration."
"9475202","Project Summary Abuse of psychostimulants, including amphetamines (AMPHs), is a major public health problem with profound psychiatric, medical and psychosocial complications. Genetic factors contribute substantially to an individual's susceptibility to developing addiction; however, the search for risk alleles has yielded limited success. The initial sensitivity to psychostimulants varies significantly, and has been associated with continued use and abuse. This trait can be studied in animal models, which have emerged as powerful tools to investigate the behavioral response to drugs in a controlled and systematic manner. The combination of approaches we propose in this application will allow us to harness the power of Drosophila genetics to uncover novel genes and gene variants that confer sensitivity to AMPH. With its rapid life cycle and accessibility to genetic, cellular and molecular analyses, the fly has enabled behavioral studies in areas that are far more difficult to investigate in vertebrate animal models. The preliminary data presented in this application show that that flies respond to AMPH by increasing their locomotor activity and decreasing their sleep. Genetic mutations that disrupt dopamine (DA) synthesis or dopamine transporter gene (DAT) function inhibit these behavioral responses, demonstrating that we have developed a robust behavioral tool to associate genetic variations with phenotypic changes. We have developed a strategy combining this behavioral analysis with next-generation (Next-Gen) sequencing technology and systems genetics approaches to investigate the genetic architecture of AMPH sensitivity and identify new gene variants that influence this trait. This integrated approach is made possible by our active collaboration with Dr. David Goldman and Dr. Colin Hodgkinson at the Laboratory of Neurogenetics at NIAAA, experts in state-of-the-art Next-Gen technologies, genetic linkage studies and functional genomics approaches to the study of behavioral traits. We propose the following specific aims: 1) To identify gene variants that underlie wide variation in AMPH sensitivity within and between substrains of the wild- type, non-isogenic Drosophila strain Canton S (CS). We will (a) use selective breeding, combined with genomic approaches such as whole genome sequencing and deficiency mapping, to identify gene variants that alter AMPH sensitivity in different CS substrains and b) use RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile gene expression changes associated with altered sensitivity to AMPH in the different substrains and 2) To screen a large population of inbred strains to identify genetic loci associated with altered sensitivity to AMPH. We will (a) screen the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, which consists of 203 genotyped inbred lines, for response to AMPH and (b) use systems genetics approaches, including quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and extreme QTL mapping, to associate phenotypic variation in sensitivity to AMPH with DNA polymorphisms."
"9502966","Thiazides are one of the most cost-effective and medically beneficial first line antihypertensive agents. However, they don?t work for everyone, and in some patients they may lower blood pressure for a while but then wear off. The mechanisms responsible for thiazide resistance have been mysterious, until recently. Our recent systems-biology investigations revealed a salt-transport process is activated by a novel mechanism to limit urinary salt wasting when NCC, the thiazide target, is inhibited or hypokalemic intravascular volume depletion occurs. We discovered that a salt reabsorption pathway is created by the coordinate induction of a multi-gene transport system in non-? intercalated cells, highlighting the Cl/HCO3- exchanger, pendrin, alpha-ketoglutarate (?-KG) and the ?-KG G-Protein Coupled Receptor, OXGR1. Our recently published and preliminary data strongly suggest that paracrine delivery of ?-KG stimulates OXGR1 in non-? cells and this activates pendrin, stimulates salt reabsorption, and potentially lowers the diuretic response. Here, we have assembled a highly collaborative, multidisciplinary team to rigorously test the central tenants of the ?- KG /OXGR1/pendrin hypothesis (Aim 1), explore the underlying molecular mechanism(s) linking OXGR1 to pendrin activation (Aim 2), elucidate the physiological stimuli and consequences of the Renal ?-KG/OxGR1 Paracrine system (Aim 3), building on our recent discoveries. We expect these investigations will have a major impact on understanding how the kidney controls salt balance in health and disease, in ways that illuminate the central underpinnings of the variable diuretic response. Ultimately, these studies will provide new information and diagnostic tools that lead to the better treatment of hypertension."
"9684364","Project Summary/Abstract The immune system surveys the skin and other barrier tissues such as lung and gut, but mechanisms for failed immunity in the periphery that lead to cancer or autoimmune diseases are unknown. The dendritic cell (DC) is a specialized immune sentinel that directs T cells to tolerance or immunity. DC comprise a rich network in skin consisting of several different populations, but are understudied, leaving a major gap in therapeutic intervention. We have identified distinct properties for DC in skin that relay information by migrating out to the draining lymph node (LN). We find during inflammation skin migratory DC may direct T cells to tolerance by unknown mechanisms, counter-regulating and controlling immunity. These cells are uniquely genetically programed in humans and in mouse to dampen immunity with a high expression of shared tolerance genes, including some genes such as PD-L1 that have been successfully targeted in the clinic for peripheral tissue cancers including melanoma skin cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer. We hypothesize homeostatic programming of skin DC leads to failed immune priming leading to impaired early detection of skin cancers. We find these pathways are of great importance as therapeutic targets to promote self-tolerance (such as during autoimmune disease) or to block tolerance (to improve immunity during cancer). Because these mechanisms are distinct they can be combined with current modalities for patients in immunotherapy of skin cancer, vaccine science, and inflammatory skin disease. In 2 discrete aims, this application will address programmatic conditioning of skin DCs and the unique cellular mechanisms by which they promote immune tolerance in both mice and humans, examining consequences during immune priming and early skin cancer growth."
"9496495","Although smoking is a significant cause of damage to health and quality of life specifically for Veterans with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), smoking cessation interventions for this population are lacking. Dr. Wilson?s proposed CDA-2 projects will develop and test a mobile health (mHealth) intervention called Mobile Contingency Management plus Evidence-Based Smoking Cessation for HIV-positive Veterans (MESH). The MESH intervention uses mHealth and telehealth technology to a) individually personalize smoking cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy, b) deliver reinforcement for smoking abstinence, and c) provide relapse- prevention messaging support. It is a personalized, tailored, multi-component intervention for smoking cessation specifically designed for Veteran smokers living with HIV. Specific aims are as follows:  Aim 1: To qualitatively explore smoking cessation treatment preferences among Veteran smokers living with HIV, and to quantitively evaluate perspectives on relapse-prevention messages among Veterans and smokers living with HIV. We will complete N = 20 semi-structured interviews with VHA HIV patients (initial treatment tailoring phase) and subsequently complete N = 400 quantitative rapid online surveys (secondary user satisfaction data). Results will be used to refine design/content of the proposed intervention.  Aim 2: To use a successive cohort design to develop and obtain patient feedback on an mHealth smoking cessation intervention that uses computerized algorithms to personalize treatment. We will collect qualitative data on 3 cohorts of n = 5 Veteran smokers with HIV. Results from each cohort will be iteratively used to modify the MESH treatment design/content/user experience.  Aim 3: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of MESH. After finalizing design of the mHealth app, we will conduct a trial in which N = 30 Veteran smokers with HIV will be randomized to either MESH or to a comparison condition (VA Quitline and SmokefreeVET). Outcomes include feasibility of the overall approach and acceptability of the intervention. Tests of efficacy are not appropriate given power considerations and the overall focus on treatment development. Results will be used in an IIR application in Year 3 of the timeline. While the IIR design may change, I plan to propose a Hybrid Type 1 implementation-effectiveness design to test effectiveness of the MESH intervention while collecting preliminary clinic-level implementation data.  Aim 4: To quantitatively examine trends and determine health disparities in use of smoking cessation aids among patients living with HIV and receiving VHA clinical care. I will leverage two large national VA cohorts to compare smoking cessation pharmacotherapy prescriptions by demographic group and medical comorbidity. I expect to detect disparities in pharmacotherapy prescription rates by medical comorbidity (e.g., pain, Hepatitis C coinfection) and demographic group (e.g., ethnicity). Results will enable future examination of whether MESH may help overcome existing disparities.  This CDA-2 application is highly significant given that: 1) Smoking is prevalent among and particularly harmful for HIV-positive Veterans; 2) There is a dearth of research on smoking cessation for Veterans with HIV; 3) Current approaches to smoking cessation in this population are not efficacious; 4) As the largest U.S. provider of HIV health services, VHA is an ideal setting; and 5) The proposed intervention follows the VA Blueprint for Excellence, which prioritizes mHealth and treatment personalization to increase reach/efficacy.  This CDA-2 application is innovative and unique in the following ways: 1) It is the first multi-component mHealth intervention for HIV-positive Veteran smokers that individually personalizes treatment; 2) Previous interventions have not attempted to maintain abstinence effects of behavioral reinforcement by offering relapse-prevention messaging; and 3) There is currently little knowledge of health disparities in VHA prescriptions for smoking cessation pharmacotherapy among Veterans with HIV."
"9585438","Project summary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the leading cause of death due to an infectious organism. However, approximately 90% of individuals who are infected remain disease free and maintain a latent infection. The mechanisms by which some individuals are protected while others succumb remains an open question. Clearly diseases affecting immune function such as AIDS or environmental factors that promote lung damage such as smoking are major risk factors. Nevertheless, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of what immune factors are required for controlling an Mtb infection. Our published studies suggest that exosomes, small membrane vesicles released from most nucleated cells, may be playing a previously unidentified role in regulating an immune response to an Mtb infection. We have found that exosomes released from Mtb-infected macrophages contain mycobacterial components and can stimulate both an innate and acquired immune response in vitro and in vivo. Recent studies have identified Mtb RNA as one of the components present in these exosomes. This interesting and unexpected finding suggest that host RNA sensors may be activated during the course of a mycobacterial infection. Surprisingly we know little in regards to the importance of bacterial RNA in stimulating a host immune response. In contrast, numerous studies have shown viral RNA to be major drivers of a cellular response through activation of RNA sensors such as TLR3 and Rig-1. Therefore a better understanding of how mycobacterial RNA is packaged into exosomes and how these exosomes function in host immunity will open up new areas of investigation into bacterial RNA as immune modulators as well as gain further insight into the role of exosomes in the host response to an Mtb infection. The importance of Mtb RNA is supported by our preliminary data which shows that exosomes released from infected but not from uninfected macrophages can induce IFN-? production in naïve macrophages and do so in an Mtb RNA dependent manner. We hypothesize that Mtb RNA is secreted during an active infection and functions through exosomes as an important driver of the host immune response. Therefore, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to characterize the mechanism by which Mtb RNA is trafficked to exosomes as well as define the composition of the Mtb RNA within the exosomes. While in specific aim 2 we will use in vitro and in vivo studies to characterize the function of the Mtb exosomal RNA. Information garnered from these studies will not only provide new information on the mechanism of immune regulation during an Mtb infection but also provide potential new targets for tuberculosis diagnostics in the form of exosomal RNA."

"9688694","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to elucidate the structures and fundamental mechanisms that give rise to drug transfer across the cell membrane by the AbgT-family of transporters. The primary targets of the proposed work are the Alcanivorax borkumensis YdaH and Neisseria gonorrhoeae MtrF transporters. Approximately 13,000 putative transporters of the family have been identified. However, no structural information has yet been available and even functional data are minimal for this family of membrane proteins. It has been hypothesized that the AbgT-family transporters contribute to the bacterial folate synthesis pathway by importing the catabolite p-aminobenzoyl- glutamate for producing this essential vitamin. To understand the structure and function of the AbgT family of transporters, we have recently cloned, expressed, purified and crystallized the full-length A. borkumensis YdaH and N. gonorrhoeae MtrF membrane proteins. We have also determined the X-ray structures of these two transporters at 2.9 and 3.9 Å resolutions, respectively. The structures reveal that these two transporters assemble as dimers with architectures distinct from all other families of transporters. Both YdaH and MtrF are bowl- shaped dimers with a solvent-filled basin extending from the cytoplasm halfway across the membrane bilayer. The monomers of YdaH and MtrF contain nine transmembrane helices and two hairpins. These structures directly suggest a plausible pathway for substrate transport. A combination of the crystal structure, genetic analysis and substrate accumulation assay indicates that both YdaH and MtrF behave as exporters, capable of removing the folate metabolite p-aminobenzoic acid from bacterial cells. Further experimental data based on drug susceptibility and radioactive transport assay suggest that both YdaH and MtrF participate as antibiotic efflux pumps, importantly mediating bacterial resistance to sulfonamide antimetabolite drugs. Our hypothesis is that many of these AbgT-family transporters act as exporters, thereby conferring bacterial resistance to sulfonamides. The specific aim is to define the structures and transport mechanisms of the AbgT family of transporters. We will use the structural, biochemical and computational approaches to determine the molecular mechanisms of the YdaH and MtrF transporters. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an obligate human pathogen and the infectious agent for the sexually-transmitted disease gonorrhea. Although gonorrhea is one of the oldest described diseases, it remains a significant global problem with more than 100 million cases reported annually worldwide, with antibiotic resistance increasing at an alarming rate. Sulfonamides were used in the late 1930s and early 1940s to treat gonorrhea, but the rapid emergence of strains resistant to this class of drug resulted in the removal of sulfonamides from lists of recommended therapies. Therefore, elucidating the structures and mechanisms of the AbgT-family transporters will provide important new targets for the rational design of novel antibiotics to combat these bacterial infections."
"9520535","7: Project Summary/Abstract Marmosets are emerging as an important model species for neuroscience research, driven by the development of new technologies such as CRISPR that allow targeted genetic modifications in this species. These developments will allow primate research to take advantage of powerful genetic tools that were previously restricted largely to rodents, including optogenetics, genetic activity reporters, and targeted mutation of endogenous genes implicated in brain function and human disease. Marmosets are well suited to this approach, being small and fast-breeding compared to most primates. They are typically housed in family groups, and exhibit a variety of social behaviors in captivity including complex vocal repertoires. Marmosets thus represent a promising system for studying social behavior and other cognitive functions in a primate model, and they also hold great promise for modeling brain disorders that affect cognitive functions that are difficult to study in other species such as rodents. To take full advantage of these emerging animal models, it is necessary to develop new methods for analyzing their behavior, including naturalistic social interactions that are imperfectly captured by standardized behavioral tasks. We therefore plan to develop a system for automated analysis of marmoset behaviors in the home cage. The system will consist of an integrated array of sensors including video cameras, depth sensors, and collar-mounted wearable microphones. The resulting multimodal data will be synchronized and analyzed using methods from computer vision, speech processing, machine learning, and multimodal data analysis. Specifically we will formulate the tracking analysis as a probabilistic graphical model, which will allow video data to be integrated with audio recordings, and with other modalities that could be explored in future, including inertial motion sensors, physiological recordings and other contextual data. Based on this approach we will develop methods to classify calls, identify individual callers, track the locations and identities of each animal in three dimensions, and classify different actions, including interactions between individuals. We envisage that our system will be useful for a wide range of studies in basic and translational neuroscience, and in particular it will be useful for studying behavioral phenotypes in genetic models of human psychiatric disorders, and for relating behavioral abnormalities to their underlying genetic and neural causes."
"9545571","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) struggle with mental health problems, most commonly anxiety and depression. Despite their high prevalence and associated impairment, co-occurring psychiatric disorders often are untreated in adults with ASD. Emerging evidence suggests that specially modified cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) effectively reduces anxiety and depression in adults with ASD; however, few clinicians are trained to deliver this type of care. Little is known regarding how to best deploy such evidence-based mental health interventions for adults with ASD in community mental health (CMH) settings. The aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Identify CMH clinicians' training needs, from both therapist and consumer perspectives, to provide quality care to adults with ASD and co-occurring anxiety disorders; 2) Adapt an anxiety treatment manual for adults with ASD and a therapist training protocol to implement this intervention in CMH centers; and 3) Examine the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted treatment and associated therapist training protocol. This study will rely on an established academic-community partnership between the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Mental Health Policy and Services Research and two Philadelphia CMH centers serving adults. Qualitative and quantitative data from focus groups, semi-structured individual interviews, and online surveys, combined with expert opinion, will be integrated to inform the design of the anxiety intervention manual for adults with ASD and a CMH clinician training protocol. Findings from this study will be used to increase the currently limited treatment options available for adults with ASD and co-occurring anxiety disorders. The proposed research and training activities facilitate the applicant's long-term goal of pursuing an academic research career dedicated to improving mental health services and quality of life for adults with ASD through dissemination and implementation science. Specific training goals are to: 1) Gain expertise in academic-community partnership; 2) Develop skills related to designing and implementing new practices in the public mental health sector; 3) Acquire a strong foundation in mixed methods; and 4) Integrate research, professional development, and scholarship to prepare for success as an independent researcher."
"9495760","PROJECT SUMMARY  Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are linked by clinical, neuropathological and genetic overlap1. It was recently discovered that a G4C2 repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of FTD and ALS (?c9FTD/ALS?)2, 3. A growing body of evidence suggesting that repeat-containing RNA [r(G4C2)exp or r(G2C4)exp], which is bidirectionally transcribed from the C9ORF72 expansion, is a key player in c9FTD/ALS pathogenesis14. Currently, there are no effective treatments for FTD or ALS, in part because of an incomplete understanding of the causative pathological mechanisms. Herein we propose to develop small molecule chemical probes of r(G4C2)exp and r(G2C4)exp (dys)function to study repeat biology, thereby identifying the most therapeutically relevant targets and pathways to treat c9FTD/ALS. Indeed, this grant application brings forward novel and innovative chemical approaches to develop highly selective chemical probes that target RNA, to validate the RNA targets of small molecules (with Core B), to study cellular selectivity (with Core B), and to image RNA in cellular systems. Not only will our findings benefit c9FTD/ALS patients, they will have broad implications for many microsatellite expansion diseases.  Our proposed studies are enabled by our recently reported studies in which we discovered three compounds that bind r(G4C2)exp in cells and significantly inhibit two modes of RNA toxicity (generation of toxic proteins via repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation and formation of foci) in c9FTD/ALS in cells over-expressing r(G4C2)66 and induced neurons (iNeurons) directly converted from fibroblasts of C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers12. In particular, we will: (i) lead optimize our previously identified compounds in collaboration with Core B; (ii) define features in small molecules that provide an ideal chemical probe of repeat (dys)function; and (iii) use our chemical probes to uncover the underlying pathophysiology of the c9FTD/ALS repeat expansion, including the mechanism of RAN translation, identification of all proteins sequestered in foci, and studying defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport of C9ORF72 by imaging the RNA in its natural context with small molecule probes (Core B).  Our studies are highly synergistic with Project 2 (development of biomarkers against c9RAN proteins and studying pathophysiology in a recently developed mouse model of c9ALS/FTD13) and Project 3 (abnormalities in nuclear pores and transport caused by the c9FTD/ALS repeat expansion). Indeed, our optimal chemical probes will be provided to Profs. Petrucelli, Gendron, & Rothstein to augment their studies."
"9483542","Project Summary Studies on the health effects of sex tourism report that sex workers are one of the most vulnerable groups for acquiring HIV due to their high rates of sexual risk behaviors1 and their disadvantaged positions to negotiate safe sex because of social, economic, and cultural factors.2 In low prevalence countries with concentrated epidemics, HIV prevalence rates among sex workers are often 3 to 4 times that of the general population.3 This risk is often perpetuated by the availability and accessibility of illegal drugs in tourism zones. While studies have examined the association between HIV risk-related behaviors including drug use and sexual risk-taking and the social and physical environment that characterize neighborhoods;4, 8-11 there is a fundamental gap in the current scientific evidence-base about which extra-individual contexts, ?activity spaces? (spaces in which daily activities occur) and social interactions or networks interact, and how that impacts HIV risk behavior. The goal of the proposed research is to utilize innovative spatial-temporal and social network methodology to describe the relationship between activity spaces and social network characteristics of male migrant sex workers in tourism zones in the Dominican Republic (DR), and to assess how such daily activity patterns and networks jointly affect HIV risk behavior, testing and infection. Considering that the DR has one of the largest sex tourism industries in the Caribbean and is currently experiencing a dramatic increase in the use and transport of illegal drugs, spurred by a shift in smuggling routes to the United States,27, 28 the country provides a unique environment for examining how environmental and social structures shape HIV risk and related behaviors among sex workers. A deeper understanding of the multiple factors that influence day-to-day experiences of male migrant sex workers is paramount for reducing the HIV burden in the DR, and for preventing international transmission through tourism and migrant routes. This study has three specific aims: (1) To utilize novel spatial-temporal methodology to characterize the activity spaces of male migrant sex workers in the Dominican Republic by linking activity space GPS data to already collected, novel ethnographic mapping data from a current NIDA-funded R01, and to examine the impact of risky activity spaces on HIV risk and related behaviors, specifically drug use, risky sex, HIV testing, and self-reported HIV; (2) To describe the social networks (e.g. size, composition) of male migrant sex workers, and assess the role social networks have on HIV risk and related behaviors in this population; (3) To examine the interaction between daily activity space and social network characteristics on HIV risk and related behaviors. If activity spaces can be identified and play a significant role in drug use and other HIV-related behaviors?including their combined role with network characteristics?it will provide critical information for creating effective structural and interpersonal HIV prevention interventions. To address the current barriers to HIV prevention and treatment, it is paramount that we focus not only on multiple social determinants, but also on the social experiences and lives of at risk populations."
"9481675","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atopic dermatitis (AD), commonly called `eczema', is a frequently disabling cutaneous disorder characterized by intense pruritus and chronic skin inflammation. Defective epidermal barrier function and immune dysregulation have long been considered the major precipitating factors in the development of AD. However, therapeutics targeting these factors alone are frequently inadequate to control atopic disease. Growing evidence from our lab and others suggests that peripheral sensory nerves play a critical role in modulating inflammatory responses in the skin. Performing in vivo imaging in a mouse model of chronic allergic eczema, I have shown that peripheral sensory nerves undergo neural pathfinding within days in response to epicutaneous exposure to ovalbumin. Neural proliferation and upregulation of neuropeptidergic fibers precede vascular reactivity and inflammatory influx by days to weeks. Pharmacologic blockade of neural activity during periods of OVA exposure prevents eczema development. These data suggest that peripheral sensory nerves act as biosensors to detect antigen(s) in the skin and subsequently to coordinate the vasoimmune response. Members of the Mas-related G- protein coupled receptor (Mrgpr) family function as innate sensors in a subset of cutaneous nociceptive fibers to relay non-histaminergic itch and in mast cells to mediate the stimulatory effects of inflammatory peptides resulting in mast cell degranulation. These neuronal and mast cell Mrgprs respond to a variety of endogenous and exogenous stimuli, making them attractive candidate molecules for serving dual functions of antigen surveillance and immune modulation in response to offending agents. I propose to use a multimodality approach including in vitro and in vivo strategies to evaluate the role of Mrgprs in mediating neural and mast cell responses to antigenic stimulation and in propagating of cutaneous inflammation in a mouse model of allergic eczema."
"9570701","ABSTRACT: RESEARCH PROJECT #2 Manuscripts submitted to medical journals are typically reviewed by physicians or researchers, with no input from patients or other community members. However, involvement of community members in other phases of the research process suggests that they provide distinct and useful expertise. Such involvement may lead to enhanced understanding of community priorities, refinement of study designs to minimize participant burden, and increased recruitment and retention of subjects. In general, community involvement in research is more common in the earlier phases of the research process (selection of research question and development of a study protocol) and less common in later phases (dissemination and implementation of findings). We conducted a pilot study that recruited and trained community members to review medical journal manuscripts. We found that community reviewers were much more likely than scientific reviewers to comment on i) the relevance of the study to patients and communities, ii) the diversity and complexity of the study participants, iii) the social context of the condition studied, and iv) barriers to implementation of study findings by patients and communities. We now seek to rigorously determine the impact of community members reviewing medical journal manuscripts. We propose a randomized controlled trial involving 16 community members who will receive training and mentoring in reviewing manuscripts. To ensure that the perspectives of health disparity populations are well represented, at least 75% of participants will be racial/ethnic minorities, be sexual/gender minorities, or have a low socioeconomic status. A total of 568 manuscripts submitted to 2 medical journals will be randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. Intervention manuscripts will be reviewed by both a community member and by scientific reviewers while control manuscripts will be reviewed only by scientific reviewers. Journal editorial teams will use all reviews to help them make decisions about acceptance, revision, or rejection of manuscripts. Quantitative and qualitative analyses will i) compare the content of community and scientific reviews, ii) determine the usefulness of community reviews to journal editors, and iii) explore how community reviewer comments are integrated into published articles. The proposed project is a novel approach to engaging health disparity populations and other community members in dissemination of research findings. This approach has the potential to provide new and distinct perspectives, to increase the quality and relevance of articles published in medical journals, and to enhance dissemination and implementation of research findings.  "
"9487276","Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection in the U.S., is a major cause of infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy among women and has been associated with increased HIV acquisition. Because women experience the most severe sequelae, the focus of Ct prevention in the U.S. has been on screening sexually active women < 25 years old. Though men are reservoirs of the infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not recommended targeting men due to lack of evidence for this approach. This research will fill this gap. African American (AA) women are 7.5 times more likely to be infected with Ct than whites, thus AA are the focus of this research. We hypothesize that screening AA men is essential to curbing the high rates of Ct among young AA women and that a bundled approach will by synergistic. Our community-based pilot program, called ?Check it,? is a pilot- tested male screening program which targeted AA men aged 15-25. At the core of this intervention is male Ct screening, but it is also bundled with other evidence-based and best practices for Ct control including: venue- based sampling (VBS), social network peer referral, modest monetary incentives (MMI), screening of target men, rescreening of target men found to be Ct positive with text reminders (Text-RS) , expedited treatment for index men (EIT) and for the partners (EPT), and Wed-based education (Web-Ed). The goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a pilot-tested, bundled Ct prevention program focusing on screening young AA men for the prevention of Ct among young AA women: Aim 1. To determine the impact of Check it on women's Ct rates ? This aim has a formative phase and an intervention phase. In the formative phase, the pilot Check it is developed and manualized. In the intervention, Check it is implemented and evaluated. We hypothesize that, post-intervention, Ct rates among AA women in the intervention community will be significantly lower compared to rates in the control communities, and that Check it will result in high rates of index/partner treatment and rescreening. Aim 2. To model the potential impact and optimal coverage needed - Using inputs from this study and the literature, a deterministic population-based epidemiological model will be used to model the number of cases averted by Check it and to determine the potential impact at different intensities of the intervention. Aim 3. To determine the cost effectiveness of Check it - Time motion studies will be conducted and used as inputs for the cost-benefit/effectiveness analysis of the Check it Program in order to distinguish study from program costs. If Check it is found to be effective as hypothesized, we will conduct future translational research to disseminate the program. This research has the potential for practical application by improving reproductive health and high impact by removing disparities in the control of Ct among AA men. ."

"9475249","PROJECT SUMMARY During the formation of egg and sperm, the homologous recombination-mediated exchange of genetic material between homologs is critical for proper chromosome segregation. Defects in crossing over can have catastrophic consequences ranging from miscarriage to chromosomal abnormalities such as Down and Klinefelter Syndromes. These defects result from absent or aberrantly placed crossovers (COs) and are influenced by chromosome-specific factors that are poorly understood. Identifying the underlying causes responsible for these chromosome-specific effects is a major challenge in the field, in part because CO formation is regulated at multiple steps, and in part because changes in distribution are not detected until they have deleterious consequences. Our goal is to identify factors whose loss predisposes chromosomes to missegregation by influencing how and where COs occur. This work could ultimately lead to preventative measures to avoid meiotic failure. A prior genetic screen in our lab led to the identification and subsequent characterization of factors that are specifically required for CO formation on the X chromosome and not the autosomes, revealing that chromosome-specific factors contribute significantly to meiotic CO formation. In this exploratory grant, we build upon this work and propose to develop fluorescent reporter strains of C. elegans that will allow us to obtain recombination data for multiple chromosomes simultaneously. This tool will provide unprecedented access to chromosome-specific and genomic patterns of CO distribution and allow us to assess whether they change coordinately in response to various stresses and mutations. We will use this tool to screen for new meiotic regulators based on their ability to directly change the recombination landscape. In addition, the fluorescent reporter strains will be provided to the C. elegans community where they will be useful both as mapping strains and in detailed analysis of meiotic mutants and environmental exposures."
"9481303","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much of science consists of discovering and modeling causal relationships that occur in nature. Increasingly big data are being used to drive such discoveries. There is a pressing need for methods that can efficiently infer causal networks from large and diverse types of biomedical data and background knowledge. This center of excellence will develop, implement, and evaluate an integrated set of tools that support causal modeling and discovery (CMD) of biomedical knowledge from very large and complex biomedical data. We also plan to actively share our knowledge, methods, and tools with others, through an innovative set of training and consortium activities. In the past 25 years, there has been tremendous progress in developing general computational methods for representing and discovering causal knowledge from data, based on a representation called causal Bayesian networks (CBNs). These methods have been applied successfully in a wide range of fields, including medicine and biology. While much progress has been made in the development of these computational methods, they are not readily available, sufficiently efficient, nor easy to use by biomedical scientists, and they have not been reconfigured to exploit the increasingly Big Data available for analysis. This Center will make these methods widely available, highly efficient when applied to big datasets, and easy to use. The proposed Center will provide a powerful set of concepts and tools that accelerate the discovery and sharing of causal knowledge derived from very large and complex biomedical datasets. The approaches and products emanating from this center of excellence are likely to have a significant positive impact on our understanding of health and disease, and thereby on the improvement of human health."

Going forward under the new application, our activities align closely with the goals of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease to increase awareness of ADRC activity, educate the public about AD and non-AD dementia, partner with care providers across all levels to enhance dementia care quality and efficiency, and provide education and support programs to patients with dementia and their families. To achieve these goals, our core will leverage electronic and social media and deliver new and innovative support programs for patients and caregivers. We will continue to assist the Clinical Core in recruitment and retention of participants for center and center-related studies, including clinical trials and national biomarker and genetics initiatives. We will extend our outreach and educational activities to support the center-affiliated Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, which shares data on cognitively normal older adults with ADRC investigators. Importantly, the Mayo OREC will provide education, support services, and programs to traditionally underserved populations (i.e., rural residents in Rochester; African American elders in Jacksonville), thereby facilitating representation of these demographics in ADRC research. ADRC investigators and personnel will continue to support OREC goals by participating in educational programs and activities in international, national, regional, local, and institutional venues. These activities include traditional research presentations at scientific meetings, training and education of professionals and paraprofessionals, and support and education services for patients and caregivers. We will continue to contribute to the leadership of, and work synergistically with, the Alzheimer's Association, organizations representing the interests of patients with non-AD dementia, and other local, state, and national entities invested in dementia education and patient care needs. We will continue to promote and cultivate programs to educate and train the next generation of dementia investigators and clinicians by providing access to high quality, evidence-based training activities and continuing to partner with Mayo's Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program. We will also continue our tradition of strongly supporting junior and minority investigators.

"9689629","ABSTRACT Microglia, the resident phagocytes of the central nervous system, play a crucial role in synapse elimination during circuit refinement. Synaptic connections initially made in excess are selectively removed by microglia in a neural-activity-dependent manner. Failure to appropriately refine synaptic connections is thought to be a key contributor to neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability and autism. Although synapse elimination is vital for proper circuit assembly, the molecular cues that microglia utilize to differentiate between synapses are not well understood. In the peripheral immune system, a balance between pro-phagocytic and anti-phagocytic signals enables discriminate phagocytosis. The pro-phagocytic cues that regulate how peripheral immune phagocytes clear their targets also regulate how microglia interact with neurons. However, the anti-phagocytic signals found in the peripheral immune system have not yet been identified in microglia. I will test if CD47-SIRP?, an anti-phagocytic signaling cascade described in the peripheral immune system, is required in the central nervous system to prevent inappropriate synapse removal. I hypothesize CD47-SIRP? signaling ensures appropriate circuit refinement in the developing postnatal brain by protecting select synapses against microglial phagocytosis. This study will be the first to reveal how anti-phagocytic signals mediate select synapse removal, a formative step in brain development.!"

"9494697","PROJECT SUMMARY Animal and human studies indicate that extreme forms of early life stress are implicated in structural and functional maladaptation in the brain during the early life course. At the same time, research on developmental psychopathology has indicated that early caregiving and development of insecure or disorganized attachment put children at risk for maladaptive behavioral and emotional problems. Thus, the roots of psychopathology likely take shape during this period of development in the context of transactions between the infant, caregiving environment, and developing brain architecture. Yet, we know little about the potential neurobiological mechanisms linking these transactional processes. Leveraging new methods for assessing infant brain via resting state fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), this exploratory/ developmental project aims to explore how integration of neural networks over the first year of life vary as a function of caregiving processes and underlie differences in attachment security/insecurity at the end of the first year. In doing so, we will use longitudinal assessments and multimethod techniques to examine how the quality of infant-mother attachment contributes to intra-network and inter-network connectivity from 3 to 12 months using dynamic whole-brain data-driven approaches. At 3 and 12 months of age, infant scans will be conducted during natural sleep, and resting state functional MRI and DTI will assess changes in functional and structural large-scale network connectivity. At 3, 6, and 9 months, infant-mother interactions will be assessed via (a) an established paradigm that provides age-appropriate assessment of infant attachment-related behavior, and (b) new technology that enables collection of the infant's naturalistic home environment on a large-scale using an automated system that is reliable and valid. At 12 months, infant- mother attachment will be assessed via the gold-standard Strange Situation Procedure. By incorporating multiple levels of analysis across multiple time scales, our project will provide novel insight into transactions among maternal caregiving, infant behavior, and neural networks across the first year of life that underlie infants' attachment-related behavior and representations. Such innovation holds promise for conceptual advances in understanding the role of early caregiving environments in the development of early trajectories of brain and behavior, as well as potential applications for preventive intervention."
"9570700","ABSTRACT: RESEARCH PROJECT #1 Hypertension disproportionately affects and is inadequately controlled among African American and poor populations. Health providers generally lack the skills and resources to address social contextual factors (i.e. health and community services, social networks, social stressors, physical environment, and economic resources) that influence management of hypertension. In prior work, we found that patients identify such social contextual factors as barriers to management of hypertension and are interested in working with lay health advisors to address these factors. We also developed and pilot tested culturally competent methods to train lay health advisors about hypertension and social contextual factors. We now propose to determine the impact of using trained lay health advisors to help patients address social contextual factors that influence hypertension management. Specifically, we propose a cluster randomized controlled trial involving 312 African American patients with poorly controlled hypertension at 8 clinics. Intervention patients will meet monthly in small groups with a trained lay health advisor. Lay health advisors will use an African American heritage theme as a framework to educate patients about blood pressure and hypertension treatment, will help patients better utilize their social networks or access health and social services, and will teach patients how to communicate more effectively with primary care physicians about barriers to hypertension management. Intervention patients within each group will also support each other in accomplishing these tasks. While our intervention is unlikely to eliminate fundamental causes of health disparities such as economic deprivation, segregated housing, or lack of affordable health care, our pilot work suggests that lay health advisors can help patients become more adept at taking advantage of the personal and community resources available to them. Control patients will continue to receive usual care for hypertension. Major outcomes after 12 months will include changes in blood pressure, hypertension knowledge and perceptions, medication adherence, health care interactions, and quality of life. We will also explore mechanisms that explain the relationship between intervention and changes in blood pressure, including the role of hypertension knowledge and perceptions (e.g. self-efficacy), specific health behaviors (e.g. medication adherence), and health care interactions (e.g. patient-provider communication) as mediators. The proposed project is a novel and promising approach to help patients address the social contextual factors that affect their hypertension management. Helping patients address these barriers may lead not only to improved blood pressure but also to increased survival, reduced organ damage, and decreased health care costs. The proposed project may also serve as a model for addressing other health disparity conditions."
"9536812","ABSTRACT Pre-clinical imaging provides wonderful structural features, but is lacking in the spatial resolution for molecular features which are deep into the animal body. This is due to fundamental physical limits on optical scattering & absorption, and is especially problematic for orthotopic tumors, such as pancreas or glioma, which are grown in the middle of the body. The most relevant molecular tracers of tumor metabolism and immunology are often imaged well through the skin in subcutaneous tumors, but these images are highly superficial or achieved with microscopic imaging. There is no method to image 1-3 cm into tissue with molecular sensitivity in the microMolar to nanoMolar range. A new high-resolution, deep-tissue, imaging approach has been invented, and in this application will be further developed for whole body scanning of concentrations in the sub-microMolar range. The new approach uses thin sheets of MegaVolt (MV) x-ray from a linear accelerator (LINAC) shaped by a multileaf collimator, to induce Cherenkov excitation of luminescence for scanned imaging (CELSI). These sheets are swept over the animal to localize the excitation via Cherenkov within the animal, allowing precise knowledge of where the detected light came from. The emission is captured with time-gated low-light detector array, using an approach similar to sheet illumination microscopy. The key benefit is that the spatial resolution is determined by the LINAC beam size and location in an otherwise optically turbid sample. The design implicitly allows high precision spatial localization, and we hypothesize and test the functionality of linear correction algorithms such as spatial deconvolution and depth-dependent attenuation correction, as compared to non-linear diffusion based reconstruction. The proposed project develops the basic science of a working prototype system, as well as a collaboration to develop a commercial prototype system. The Cerenkov emission excites either phosphorescent or fluorescence molecules, which are used to directly measure metabolism or to tag molecular reporters. Initial animal studies showed CELSI could be achieved either i) at therapeutic doses at a very low molecular probe concentration (2Gy with nanoMolar probe) or ii) low radiation doses for moderately higher probe doses (0.1 Gy with microMolar probe). Recovery of images with spatial resolution less than 300 microns is readily achieved, throughout the entire body of an animal. Three parameters directly influence image quality, including 1) sheet depth, 2) delivered dose, and 3) probe concentration, and the reciprocity between these will be quantitatively examined to define acceptable and biologically relevant modes of operation. In this work, the system to image multiple rodents is developed with detection sensitivity being optimized for luminescence in a clinical LINAC. A commercial partner will provide a custom short pulsed LINAC for superior signal-to-noise and production of a prototype commercial system. Metabolic and immune sensing probes will be optimized for orthotopic pancreas cancer imaging, which is critical to understand responses of tumors that effectively recapitulate the growth and pathophysiology of human disease within the pancreas. This full-body high-resolution molecular optical imaging has particular relevance to advancing research into orthotopic cancer models and internal organ diseases, which are not resolved well with any current molecular imaging tools."
"9601439","Abstract  Chronic wounds impact ~6.5M people and cost ~$25B per year in the US alone. Despite significant effort, understanding the mechanisms involved in development of chronic wounds in humans has met with limited success, primarily because we cannot experiment in humans and because current animal models are inadequate. The PI and team have developed a novel mouse model for diabetic chronic wounds that closely mimics those of humans. Low levels of oxidative stress (OS) are important for proper healing; however, when OS levels are high wound healing does not occur. Human chronic wounds have high levels of OS, but it is not known if OS is critical for developing chronicity. Using diabetic mice, we can generate chronic wounds 100% of the time by creating high levels of OS immediately after wounding by treating with inhibitors specific to two antioxidant enzymes. The wounds become fully chronic within 20 days after treatment and remain chronic until the mouse dies, sometimes >100 days. The wounds in the mouse model feature all of the same problems observed in human chronic diabetic wounds: high levels of OS lead to DNA damage, gene deregulation, protein and lipid damage, cell death, impaired keratinocyte migration (potentially inhibiting re- epithelialization), chronic inflammation, and lack of proper angiogenesis and deposition of matrix resulting in poor development of the healing new tissue. Equally important, the chronic wounds in the mouse model develop a biofilm from the bacteria present on the skin by elimination of non-biofilm-forming bacteria in favor of the biofilm-forming species. These biofilm-forming bacteria are also present on human skin and appear in human diabetic chronic wounds. All of these characteristics indicate that the PI's mouse model mimics all key aspects of human chronic wounds. The PI hypothesizes that high levels of OS induce changes in the dynamics of the commensal microbiome resulting in a transition to a biofilm-forming microbiome and development of the biofilm. This hypothesis will be investigated through the following studies: Aim #1: Identify the composition of the microbiome to characterize biofilm initiation and progression and develop a longitudinal statistical classifier that enables prediction of biofilm-forming bacteria in chronic wounds. Aim #2: Determine whether OS is necessary and sufficient for biofilm development. This project will use a novel model of chronic wounds developed in the PI's laboratory that has all the tissue characteristics present in human chronic wounds, contains the major bacterial pathogens present in human chronic wounds and develops a biofilm naturally, i.e. without the need to introduce bacteria from external sources. Therefore, this model will allow, for the first time, studies of the natural progression and dynamics of biofilm development in vivo. The results from these exploratory studies will serve as the basis for future mechanistic studies to determine how OS induces biofilm development. These studies will impact the field by providing, for the first time, a better understanding of whether specific bacteria can be used as prognostic tools for development of wound chronicity in mice. This work will provide insight into whether the microbiome can be exploited as a marker for healing/non-healing after debridement and in the future help with the design of proof-of-concept experiments using human specimens."
"9563731","ABSTRACT Cystinuria is an inherited human renal disease with significant morbidity affecting 1 in 7000 veterans. The disease is caused by mutation of genes involved in renal cystine transport resulting in elevated urinary cystine with kidney stone formation. Historically, the primary clinical concern of cystinuria has been that cystine spills into the urine resulting in nephrolithiasis. However, cystinuria patients develop more chronic kidney disease and hypertension than other stone formers. Additionally, little is known about other consequences of loss of amino acid transport function (of cystine, ornithine, lysine, and arginine). These additional metabolic consequences of cystinuria likely contribute to the observations that cystinuria patients develop more chronic kidney and hypertension compared to other kidney stone formers. With the genetic basis of the disorder defined (mutation in Slc3a1, cystinuria type I), opportunities for targeted molecular therapies exist. Building upon our previous grant, we propose an innovative experimental design to demonstrate long-term phenotypic correction of cystinuria in an intact animal using a combination of transposon, adeno-associated virus (AAV), and CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering technologies. In specific aim 1, we will evaluate the effects of the metabolic changes on sensitivity to and recovery from kidney injury and the development of hypertension. We will use ischemia reperfusion injury models and the unilateral ureteral obstruction to evaluate sensitivity to and recovery from kidney injury. We will also evaluate whether ?- lipoic acid has any effect on these metabolic consequences other than its known ability to increase the solubility of cystine in the urine and prevent cystine stone formation. In specific aim 2, we propose to engineer a chimeric piggyBac transposase capable of rescuing of Slc3a1 expression and we will compare this to CRISPR/Cas9 mediated targeted integration in mouse proximal tubular cells lacking Slc3a1. We also propose to attempt permanent correction of cystinuria in vivo by multiple genome engineering technologies including transposon technology with concomitant immunosuppression, hybrid AAV-transposon technology and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing or targeted integration. We will attempt correction both in neonatal and adult mice lacking Slc3a1 assaying for reduction of cystine level in the urine, increase of cystine level in the plasma, and reduction of cystine stones. The proposed studies will lead to a greater understanding of the metabolic consequences of cystinuria and develop genome engineering approaches for cystinuria and potentially other kidney diseases affecting veterans."
"9523611","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Temporal organization is critical to many perceptual, cognitive, and behavioral functions. These temporal abilities are adversely impacted in several mental health disorders including, but not limited to, schizophrenia and attention-deficit disorder (ADHD). However, the neurobiological underpinnings of the temporal organization of memory and behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we will focus on the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus (RE), an understudied brain region at the nexus of communication between the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. RE is anatomically positioned to profoundly influence interactions between memory and executive systems in the brain. Based on anatomical and theoretical considerations, we hypothesize that RE is essential to, and RE neurons represent, sequences of events and elapsed time. However, nothing is known about the role of RE in time and temporal contexts. In this project, we will directly test the role of RE in time and temporal contexts in memory and behavior. We will use a broad behavioral strategy testing three different fundamental timing tasks: AIM1, memory for sequences of events; AIM2, elapsed-time memory (scale = minutes); and AIM3, interval timing (scale = tens of seconds). One experimental approach will be to test the causal role of RE, and RE circuitry, using muscimol and state-of-the-art virally-delivered inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). In another approach, we will record RE neural activity?neurons, ensembles, and local field potentials?using cutting-edge driveable tetrode arrays. Completion of these aims will establish foundational knowledge for understanding the role of the RE in the temporal organization of memory and behavior. Importantly, we will integrate our findings into a unified theoretical framework for RE circuitry within a medial prefrontal cortex-reuniens-hippocampus system. What we learn from these studies will lead to new approaches in the study of temporal dysfunctions that occur in numerous mental health disorders."

While still a developing field, dissemination and implementation (D&I) science provides applicable theories and frameworks for the involvement of stakeholders, the development of a strategic plan, and the implementation of effective dissemination strategies related to adoption of evidence-based programs in the health sciences. Also, using the community based participatory research (CBPR) approach, our partners and community members will help guide this Core, and its commitment to involvement of four key audiences: (1) researchers and the scientific community; (2) health and community partner organizations and practitioners; (3) policy makers; and (4) lay individuals. Translating research findings into useable information depends upon the intended audience, thus many different types of activities will be conducted to disseminate the information generated by the Center. Importantly these activities will be vetted through the strategic dissemination planning process and the CAB, and each activity will be individualized to account for the audience, the content of the information and the channels. For example, presentations and papers for a variety of audiences will be produced and use of digital media will be integral. Further, these activities and the plan will use a variety of implementation and dissemination strategies that are likely to lead to adoption of interventions, changes in policies and practices, and changes in individuals' behaviors that influence the wellbeing of children and families. SIRC's strategic dissemination plan will be a collaborative effort among SIRC researchers, the CAB and community members, and media experts including the ASU PR Lab. The background research necessary to identify primary stakeholders who will benefit directly from findings of the research studies and pilots will be conducted, objectives and activities specified, timeframes and outcomes developed, staff assigned, and monitoring and evaluation will occur. We will take advantage of our already established and ongoing collaborations with CAB and other organizations to engage these agencies, their staff and their clients, in order to disseminate information and interventions that will be sustained and have a positive health impact for the targeted audiences in the Southwest."

"9469341","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a significant public health problem worldwide. However, despite the availability of medication and psychotherapeutic treatments for MDD, fewer than 40% of patients achieve remission after initial treatment. It would represent a major advance for Precision Medicine if we were able to individualize the therapy of MDD. Recent advances in analytical chemistry have led to the emergence of Metabolomics, a discipline that allows the simultaneous measurement of 100's to 1000's of metabolites to map perturbations in metabolic pathways and networks, thus potentially enabling a systems approach to the study of MDD and its treatment. Our work over the past decade has pioneered the application of metabolomics to study selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). We have mapped metabolic pathways implicated in SSRI response and discovered novel mechanisms associated with that response. In this proposal, we set out to apply metabolomics to greatly expand our knowledge of MDD treatment response by the use of previously collected samples and comprehensive clinical data from two large studies, the Emory PReDICT and the Mayo Pharmacogenomics Research Network (PGRN) trials. Both of these independent studies used the SSRI escitalopram and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine as treatments. The PReDICT study also included a non-pharmacologic treatment arm, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Our goal is to leverage these large investments made by the NIH by applying an integrated metabolomics- genomics- neuroimaging approach to characterize and functionally validate the biological systems predictive of MDD treatment outcomes. In Specific Aim 1, we will define metabolomic signatures of exposure to the 3 therapies in the treatment-naïve MDD patients from the PReDICT study. In Aim 2, we will evaluate and model the metabolomic signatures associated with improvement during treatment with escitalopram, duloxetine, and CBT, and then replicate our findings in the Mayo study. In Aim 3 we will use pharmacometabolomics-informed pharmacogenomics both to compare the biomarkers discovered in the Mayo study with those identified in PReDICT, and to identify the metabolite-associated genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms involved in mechanisms associated with variation in treatment response using cell-line based systems. Finally, our Exploratory Aim will examine linkages between central nervous system function and peripheral metabolomic signatures. This proposal is innovative because it applies the novel tool of metabolomics to the question of treatment selection in MDD, and because it integrates metabolomics with genomics and neuroimaging data to enable a deeper understanding of therapeutic mechanisms of action. It is also highly significant because it will add to evidence-based methods for the selection of optimal treatments for individual MDD patients and will expand our understanding of biological mechanisms underlying response to the therapy for this major disease."
"9520322","Project Summary/Abstract ?TR&D 1 Users of the NCXT demand and deserve to get the best possible soft x-ray tomographic reconstructions of their specimens. Meeting this expectation relies on XM-2 ? the NCXT developed soft x-ray microscope - producing the highest fidelity 2-D images of the specimen. The goal of this TR&D project is to improve XM-2 to enhance imaging fidelity, and increase specimen throughput. We will also develop new approaches to specimen preparation to allow imaging of rare and/or dynamic events. Finally, we will build instruments for cryo- preserving specimens in a User's home laboratory. This will allow Users to collect and preserve specimens from cells grown in a familiar, calibrated environment, or from time-sensitive sources, such as biological material harvested from clinics and patient populations."
"9398781","Background: The rising demands and health care costs make it urgent to develop new statistical methods to accurately predict high-costs VA patients and important risk factors associated with high costs. The ability to prospectively predict high-costs patients is an important step toward controlling future health care costs. It is also important to identify disease areas that contribute significantly to the high health care costs and other risk factors which policy makers can target by future intervention. Health care cost data are characterized by a high level of skewness and heteroscedastic variances. The large number of variables collected in the VA database provides rich information, but at the same time, imposes great challenges for statistical analysis and computation. The administrative and electronic medical record data from VA databases often contain missing data. The new statistical procedure we propose aims to take advantage of the rich databases in VA for analyzing costs data. It employs and develops state-of-art high-dimensional semiparametric statistical procedures to handle the complexity of VA data sets. Objectives: The project aims to develop a High Costs Prediction (HCP) system, which employs novel high-dimensional semiparametric statistical methods and algorithms to analyze large VA database with missing values and occurrence of censoring. The HCP system identifies potential high-costs patients, provides prediction intervals of future costs, and suggests a list of important risk factors for cost control. The outcomes of the project will help VA researchers and policy makers design effective interventions to target those potential high-cost patients and reduce their costs without sacrificing quality of care. The project will collaborate closely with VA Office of Analytics and Business Intelligence (OABI) to analyze costs data for patients receiving primary care within VHA. In particular, we will identify a set of modifiable risk factors (MRF) that are simultaneously important for improving care and reducing costs. Our proposed work fills in an important blank area of VA health care costs data analysis. By combining the HCP system with the existing Care Assessment Needs Scoring (CAN) system, we will make important progress toward the ultimate goal of building a data-driven decision support system. Methods: The project will develop a novel semiparametric procedure for predicting high costs patients. The approach we propose incorporates high-dimensional covariates and nonlinear covariate effects and addresses the challenge of censoring by death, which improves accuracy and increases the flexibility of modeling. It does not require discretizing the cost and hence fully uses the information contained in the cost data. It does not require any parametric distributional assumption. Another major contribution of this project is that we propose weighted semiparametric quantile regression based novel variable selection procedures which can simultaneously identify and estimate significant risk factors for high-dimensional data at the presence of missing values. Our approach will develop a patient level dataset that combines all available cost data from the databases provided through the Decision Support System (DSS) National Extracts. We will link data from the Managerial Cost Accounting System (MCA, formerly Decision Support System or DSS) with three VA databases including: the VA Patient Treatment File (PTF); the VA Outpatient Clinic File (OCF); and the VA Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator Subsystem death file. We will compare the newly proposed methods with existing methods using both the VA data and simulated data."
"9632312","PROJECT SUMMARY (From Parent Grant) Packaging the eukaryotic genome into chromatin allows all genomic processes, and consequently growth, development and differentiation, to be highly regulated. This is because our cells use a plethora of mechanisms to change the chromatin structure into a more compact or less compact state, in order to regulate localized access to the genome by the machinery that mediates gene expression, DNA repair, and replication. In the Tyler lab, we study the most profound way that the chromatin structure is changed in the cell, which is removal of the histone proteins from the DNA, termed chromatin disassembly and the opposite process of chromatin assembly. These processes are mediated by histone chaperones together with ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers. Over the years, my group and others have shown that chromatin disassembly and reassembly occurs during replication, gene expression and DNA double-strand break repair. By inactivating the machinery involved in chromatin disassembly and reassembly, we have shown that these chromatin dynamics play an important role in regulating these fundamental genomic processes. However, we still do not know how chromatin disassembly is triggered and how chromatin reassembly occurs in a coordinated fashion at the right time and right place. We will answer these questions by taking advantage of inducible DNA double-strand break systems. It is also important to repress the transcription of genes around a DNA double-strand break in order to achieve DNA repair and to restart transcription after DNA repair is complete. The mechanisms for this are unknown, but we will test the hypothesis that chromatin disassembly and reassembly play important roles in the regulation of transcription inhibition and restart around sites of DNA double-strand damage. Given that the key histone chaperones that mediate these processes, Asf1 and CAF-1, are overexpressed in many types of cancer, this work will not only fill large knowledge gaps but will also have relevance for understanding carcinogenesis."
"9487777","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds on the foundation established in Haiti during three decades of NIH research and training support to Weill Cornell Medical College and the Groupe Haitien d'Etude du Sarcome et des Infections Opportunistes (GHESKIO). The focus of this training program is improving the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of AIDS related tuberculosis, with an emphasis on multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). A cadre of 10 Haitian clinicians will receive 2 years of research training which will include an MPH from the Cornell-GHESKIO- Quisqueya program in Haiti. We will also respond to an urgent need expressed by the Haitian Ministry of Health for skilled laboratory leaders and establish a 2 year MS in Laboratory Science program for 8 Haitian laboratory trainees. These 18 clinical and laboratory trainees will conduct their mentored MPH and MS theses in the following priority research areas: 1) translational research on M. tuberculosis latency, persistence, and drug discovery; 2) clinical trials of new drugs for the treatment of MDR-TB, including patients with HIV; 3) maternal- child tuberculosis diagnosis, HIV/TB treatment, and prevention; 4) community-based case detection of HIV/TB and MDR-TB molecular epidemiology; 5) implementation science to scale-up new TB diagnostics and HIV/MDR-TB treatment. The program will also train research staff including nurses (6), data managers (2), social workers (2), and pharmacists (2) to participate in the aforementioned research areas. Haiti has the highest prevalence of HIV (2.2%) and tuberculosis (296/100,000) in the Western Hemisphere. There are an estimated 1,540 prevalent MDR-TB cases in Haiti, but only ~150 patients are currently treated, in large part due to the lack of skilled clinical and laboratory personnel. Therefore over 90% of MDR-TB patients are left untreated in the community. This public health risk is compounded by the fact that 1/3 of patients are also HIV-positive. The development and validation of new diagnostics and anti-tuberculous therapies, coupled with a targeted research training program will address this urgent need. This program not only responds to the priorities of the Haitian Ministry of Health but will also train the next generation of Haitian leaders in the field of HIV and tuberculosis research. Their accomplishments will have a direct effect on the national HIV/TB program in Haiti and have the potential for a major global impact."
"9488779","COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The catchment area of Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC) is the 15-county region in Northeast Ohio surrounding the City of Cleveland with a census of 4 million individuals, in which about 80% of the cancer patients seen at consortium hospitals reside. Of note, within this 15-county region, 62% of all cancer patients are seen at a consortium hospital site. Over the past 5 years, Case CCC has impacted the catchment area and beyond with thoughtful community-engaged research and outreach programs. The Center has recognized poverty as an important root cause of cancer disparities, and assembled a team of investigators, local government, and the safety-net provider network to engage communities for interventions on poverty and cancer prevention, and early detection services. The overarching goals of the Community Outreach and Engagement component are to build capacity for 1) collaborative, community-focused cancer research of relevance to the catchment area, and 2) outreach programs to increase cancer awareness and knowledge, and effective patient navigation. Specific aims of the Community Outreach and Engagement component are to:  1. Implement population-based approaches to understand cancer burden in the catchment area and to  guide scientific inquiry on distinct cancer-related challenges.  2. Use knowledge of the distinct cancer issues in the catchment area to stimulate new scientific  discoveries, and disseminate findings into the population at large, including underserved communities.  3. Promote cancer disparities reduction and health equity through an inclusive research environment. The Case CCC is also addressing the high rates of lung cancer by strategically focusing on primary and tertiary prevention, including the implementation of a tobacco Quit Line eReferral system at the MetroHealth System, and providing data and testimony that were instrumental in passing the Tobacco 21 law in the city of Cleveland in 2015. Case CCC has established a Community Advisory Board (CAB) to guide catchment area research, and recently established the Office of Cancer Disparities Research (OCDR) to support, coordinate, and foster interdisciplinary cancer disparities research, training, and outreach program evaluation. Collectively, this program seeks to demonstrate the Case CCC?s commitment to working together to enhance the discovery process, promote innovative and community-changing collaborations, educate and motivate the citizens of Northeast Ohio and beyond, and conduct research across the Center?s Research Programs of direct relevance to the catchment area."
"9528472","Project Summary  Basement membranes are important structural components of most animal tissues, contributing structural support and architectural information to the adjoining cells and cell sheets. Basement membranes are the most ancient form of extracellular matrix, and their structure and composition are highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom. Like every part of a living organism, basement membranes get damaged and need to be repaired. Despite their conserved and ubiquitous nature, there is almost nothing known about how basement membranes are repaired, or how cells sense basement membrane damage to initiate repair. In large part, this paucity of information is caused by the difficulty of finding a suitable model. The ideal model for analyzing basement membrane repair would include conditional genetic approaches to studying gene function, reproducible damage, and a damaged tissue large enough for basic biochemical analysis.  We have recently identified such a model for analyzing basement membrane repair, and it forms the basis for this proposal. We have found that feeding dextran sodium sulfate to adult Drosophila causes fast and reproducible damage to the basement membrane surrounding the gut tube, as measured by super-resolution microscopy, TEM, stress-strain analysis, and filtration capacity. The damaged basement membrane also leads to predictable and easily observed changes in gut morphology. Importantly, after withdrawal of dextran sodium sulfate, the basement membrane is repaired and the architecture is restored. Our preliminary data indicate that the basement membrane crosslinking enzyme peroxidase is required for basement membrane repair. In the two Aims of this R21 proposal, we examine the mechanisms by which peroxidase promotes repair, and how cells detect damage and initiate the repair response. These studies are highly novel and will provide some of the first information on the repair of basement membrane, and they will establish a new and powerful model for the continuing analysis of basement membrane repair."
"9467216","PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of this project is to investigate the causal effect of sociodemographic, clinical, and genetic factors on patient safety outcomes in individuals on high-risk immunosuppressive medications. Patient safety events are a leading cause of morbidity and are a major health care quality problem, causing tens of thousands of deaths each year in the U.S. Although patient safety problems in the U.S. health care system are widely recognized, research to develop new approaches to improve safety is urgently needed. For example, individuals requiring immunosuppressive medications for high-risk conditions may face serious patient safety risks, including prescribing errors, monitoring errors, and preventable adverse events (AEs). However, research regarding which patients may be at a higher risk of experiencing an AE due to medication has not been extensively studied. The overall hypothesis of this project is that sociodemographic, clinical, and genetic factors will demonstrate a causal effect on patient safety outcomes in individuals prescribed high-risk immunosuppressive medications. This project will utilize established electronic health record (EHR)-enabled registries to examine over 35,000 individuals prescribed high-risk immunosuppressive medications from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF, n=~23,000) and San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH, n=~12,000) to address three related hypothesis. First, factors such as socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, number of medical comorbidities and preferred language status will demonstrate a causal effect on process errors or AEs in individuals prescribed high-risk immunosuppressive medications. State-of-the-art causal inference statistical methods, which account for missing data, time-varying confounding and censoring will be utilized to test for the presence of these effects. Second, genetic variants within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) will demonstrate a causal effect on AEs in individuals prescribed high-risk immunosuppressive medications. Existing genomic information for patients with certain autoimmune diseases (n=~1,750) will be used for this analysis. Third, clustering and network approach analyses will identify significant sociodemographic characteristics, clinical features, and genetic variants associated with subgroups of individuals prescribed high-risk immunosuppressive medications. Using computational approaches, individuals will be classified to identify sociodemographic characteristics, clinical features, and genetic variants associated with adverse outcome risk (e.g., those who experience an AE vs. those who do not). The importance of contributing factors to process errors and AEs in individuals prescribed high-risk immunosuppressive medications will be demonstrated through this research and provide new insight into monitoring and improving safety in the ambulatory setting."
"9548859","Abstract Infection with M. tuberculosis (Mtb) can cause TB, which is now the leading global cause of mortality due to a single infectious disease agent. The failure to control TB stems from the lack of an effective vaccine. BCG, the vaccine currently in use, is unable to generate long-lived memory responses and protect against pulmonary TB in adults. New vaccines against TB are therefore, urgently needed. Our work has shown that the ?sigH mutant of Mtb is attenuated for replication and disease in macaques). Aerosol vaccination with this mutant induces strong lung immune signatures that protect against lethal TB. Nonpathogenic ?sigH infection in macaques is not reactivated by SIV co-infection. Additional unrelated mutation(s) are however needed in ?sigH to ensure its complete attenuation. This project aims to develop a ?sigH -based human TB vaccine candidate that could eventually advance to clinical development. ?sigH deletion will be added to 10 recombinant Mtb strains. Some of these mutants generate immune enhancement- or auxotrophy-based attenuation phenotypes, while others render Mtb avirulent in macaque lungs. We will assess the safety of these ten strains in SCID mice and progressively smaller numbers in immunocompetent and SIV co-infected macaques by multiplexing. Two strains that consistently provide the best results in terms of safety/immunogenicity will be evaluated in detail for immunogenicity and efficacy via aerosol (AER) vaccination relative to BCG- and ?sigH - vaccination, in a physiologically relevant macaque model."
"9535672","Contact PD/PI: Becker-Dreps, Sylvia Abstract t The growing, global impact of emerging and endemic viral diseases is a critical public health issue. The explosive spread of zika virus throughout Latin America and the Caribbean in 2015 followed only two years after a similar pattern of spread of chikungunya virus. In 2017, yellow fever virus from Amazon regions emerged in Rio de Janeiro, underscoring the risk of a major urban outbreak. In addition to these emerging and reemerging viruses, endemic viruses continue to cause a high burden of disease. Caliciviruses are now the leading causes of childhood diarrhea in Nicaragua, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus continue to cause a high burden of respiratory disease, and all four dengue serotypes are now endemic. We have designed a program to train a cadre of innovative scientists in Nicaragua to confront these emerging and endemic pathogens of high priority to the LMIC institution. The rationale for this program is to protect the public health of populations by increasing the numbers and expertise of local scientists to 1) describe the epidemiology of these viral pathogens, 2) understand their impact on morbidity and mortality, and 3) identify evidence-based approaches to reduce their prevalence and burden of disease. The Nicaraguan Emerging and Endemic Diseases (NEED) Training Program takes advantage of the convergence of a longstanding relationship between Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Nicaragua, León (UNAN-León) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), existing collaborative research for trainee projects, and strong bilateral institutional support. The program?s objectives include: 1) Provide long-term, pre-doctoral training in infectious disease epidemiology at UNC to two young investigators from UNAN-León. These graduates will contribute to the core research faculty at UNAN-León to address pressing local research agendas; 2) Create a sustainable supply of well-trained biomedical scientists in the region by establishing an accredited PhD program in Biomedical Sciences at UNAN- León; we will enroll five pre-doctoral candidates in the initial cohort. This program builds upon a successful Master?s program of Microbiology in place at UNAN-León and fills a huge need in Nicaragua for rigorous PhD- level biomedical research training. We further support five of these pre-doctoral trainees for one-month long laboratory trainings at UNC. 3) Foster professional growth and research skills development among 140 trainees of all levels, including local faculty, to ensure academic and research success. Robust short-term trainings in professional and research skills needed to become an independent investigator and successful academician are provided to both trainees and local faculty to ensure that the program?s impacts extend more broadly. This program will result in a multidisciplinary research team at UNAN-Leon to confront the emerging and endemic viral diseases that affect public health both regionally and globally. Our approach is made feasible by leveraging an existing successful Master?s program at UNAN-León and by providing trainees the opportunity to partner with mentors at both UNC and UNAN-León on a growing array of collaborative research projects."
"9394260","Even more than other screening services, it is difficult to know which patients are most likely to benefit from lung cancer screening (LCS). More difficult yet is explaining to patients the trade-offs of screening for them personally, particularly when time for discussing preventive services is limited to less than 5 minutes during a busy visit. Decision support can help, but must contain 3 key features to be maximally effective and sustainable: 1) communication of accurate estimates of the benefit of LCS for an individual patient; 2) design and content that incorporates the values and concerns of informed stakeholders (clinicians, VA leaders, and Veterans) and a practical approach to routinely personalizing screening during busy clinic visits; and 3) design that optimizes the tool?s fit with VA clinical workflows. In collaboration with my mentors and steering committee, I propose to carry out work that will leverage and substantially build on a project I am co-leading ? Ann Arbor VA?s funded PROVE QUERI ? which studies expeditious implementation of a more traditional shared decision- making (SDM) tool equipped with only the first feature (individualized estimates of LCS benefit). To achieve these goals the CDA has 3 aims.  Aim 1 ? Assess informed stakeholder views (3 projects): In this aim I will use democratic deliberation to extensively inform and engage key LCS stakeholders to understand their opinions/recommendations about offering and discussing LCS. In project 1a (?Clinical Forum?) I will recruit a group of 12-15 clinical stakeholders (PCPs, screening coordinators, and clinical leaders) from VA nationwide to inform them of the heterogeneity of LCS benefit and engage them in deliberation, obtaining their recommendations for ?simple boundary rules? for when screening should be encouraged, discouraged, or left wholly to l patient choice. In project 1b (2 ?Veteran Forums?) I will recruit a random sample of up to 64 VISN 10 Veterans who are LCS-eligible and conduct 2 separate daylong forums. The core objective will be to utilize 2 content experts with differing viewpoints to inform Veterans about the challenges of LCS implementation and the constraints of clinical practice, and then to obtain individual and group recommendations for ?simple how-to rules? clinicians can use to involve patients in LCS discussions given the competing demands PCPs face. In project 1c I will use risk communication theory to develop innovative new tool features that incorporate the VA Stakeholder guidance and can help guide clinicians in how to efficiently personalize LCS.  Aim 2 ? Optimize decision support ?fit? with the VA clinical context (2 projects): In project 2a I will conduct a synthesis analysis of multiple streams of PROVE QUERI data to understand how LCS decision support can be redesigned to overcome implementation challenges and enhance motivators for tool use. Then, in project 2b I explore wiki surveys as a new method of engaging clinical stakeholders to: 1) evaluate the new decision support content and design strategies generated in projects 1c/2a; 2) contribute new ideas; and 3) help prioritize which strategies and content for inclusion in the upgraded tool.  Aim 3 ? Pilot (3 projects): Informed by Aims 1 and 2, I will develop a paper-based prototype in project 3a. Then, in project 3b I will assess usability by conducting 5-8 monitored mock clinical encounters (each mock encounter will include a patient, a PCP, and a PACT staff member). In project 3c, I will pilot the tool with 30 PCPs who are purposively sampled from 6 diverse outpatient VA settings. Each PCP will first receive a 1-on-1 educational intervention. I will then test the feasibility of using my paper-based decision support with 2-3 LCS- eligible Veterans per participating PCP. Encounters will be audio recorded to assess the content and length of LCS discussions. PCPs and patients will complete surveys and interviews to assess satisfaction and comfort with the LCS decision-making process. The core goal is to assess whether the tool can support brief and high- quality personalized LCS discussions while being acceptable to a diverse sample of PCPs and Veterans."
"9456977","ABSTRACT Genetic susceptibility plays a significant role in glioma development. An individual with two or more first- and/or second-degree affected relatives has a two-fold increased risk of the disease. We were the first to suggest mutations in POT1 (Protection of Telomeres 1) as causative in familial glioma (FG). We have now established the presence of POT1 mutations in 5 different families, providing the strongest evidence of its role in glioma. However, we do not yet have direct functional evidence that loss of POT1 is causal in glioma leaving few options for carrier surveillance or potential treatment targets. We are currently able to explain the genetic basis of glioma in up to 12% of our families, using highly stringent criteria for calling a mutation deleterious and causal. In contrast, the majority of our families remain unexplained though several candidate genes have emerged as `suspects of interest (SOIs)'. We propose a data-driven, knowledge-based, computational approach to guide candidate gene selection for functional characterization. In order to further our efforts to explain the genetic basis of FG we propose two specific aims to: Identify new gene candidates that may cause FG through WGS (Aim 1). We will identify SNVs, small indels, and structural variants in both coding and noncoding regions of the genome, intensively annotate those variants using more than 50 data sources, and we will rank these variants using multiple criteria based on their likelihood to cause disease. In addition to the 270 FG cases (from 203 FG families) with sequence data already available, we will also sequence an additional 100 cases (from 100 families) already collected in our Glioma International Case-Control Study with a reported family history using Gliogene criteria, and 200 newly recruited cases (from 100 families) with a strong family history of glioma to enhance our discovery. ). We will molecularly characterize tumor samples when available to enable analysis of our cohort by tumor subtype. The second aim is to functionally validate SOIs to include: A) POT1 mutations identified in additional families and B) newly discovered FG susceptibility genes (SOIs) from Aim 1 using our novel experimental mouse stem cell spheres and mouse models of gliomagenesis.To determine the functional contributions of POT1 and novel mutations identified in our WGS studies, we will evaluate these genes in glioma mouse models using CRISPR gene editing technology. This study has the strong potential for delineating the genetic basis of glioma for genetic testing of high-risk families; success will offer insight on the underlying biology of glioma for future work on early detection and targeted treatment."
"9689671","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed work is to engineer multiple independent invasive gene drive systems in the Dengue mosquito, Aedes aegypti, a major vector of human insect-borne disease known to annually infect 50-100 million people worldwide, killing millions. The current approaches used for Dengue disease prevention, including vector suppression by environmental modification, insecticides and anti-pathogen drugs are simply insufficient. The replacement of wild mosquito populations with genetically modified individuals that are engineered to be disease resistant in theory should provide a sustainable long-term method for disease prevention. However, the transgenes that mediate the disease refractoriness are unlikely to confer an overall fitness benefit on insects that carry them. Additionally, wild populations are large, partially reproductively isolated, and dispersed over wide areas. Therefore, population replacement requires a gene drive mechanism in order to spread linked cargo genes mediating disease refractoriness through wild populations. I have previously developed multiple synthetic selfish genetic elements including Maternal-Effect-Dominant-Embryonic-Arrest (Medea) and recently a threshold dependent underdominance system (UDmel) in insects that can rapidly spread through populations, even in the presence of a linked cargo refractory gene that may impose a large increase in fitness cost. Here I propose to simply transfer these synthetic systems into an insect that vectors disease, Aedes aegypti. Therefore, the major aims of this proposal are to develop three systems: 1) Medea, 2) Threshold dependent underdominance (UDmel), and 3) a selfish genetic element the can rapidly spread and crash a population, all in the Dengue vector, Aedes aegypti. Each of these gene drive systems have several attractive features important for social and scientific acceptance for wild transgene releases: the systems are species specific and horizontal spread with other species is limited; minimal ecological impact in contrast to insecticides; relatively robust and unbreakable with a tight linkage of the selfish genetic element with its cargo; transgene recall (for Medea) and complete transgene removal (underdominance) can be carried out if desired. In summary, the overall goal of this proposal is to develop multiple population control technologies in the mosquito that can be applied successfully and safely to fight human disease."
"9625201","Project Summary Cancers are a leading cause of death and in efforts to reduce their incidence, as well as their recurrence after chemotherapy and/or radiation, physicians and scientists have repeatedly sought to increase the immunogenicity of cancers so as to promote host anti-cancer immune responses. These efforts were largely unsuccessful, likely in part because of the role of host Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells in limiting anti-tumor immune responses. Hence, the ability to decrease Treg function may be of major therapeutic significance if this can be done incrementally, and without full-scale depletion of Tregs that are essential to the maintenance of immune homeostasis and for the prevention of autoimmunity. Deubiquitinase enzymes (DUBs) reverse the effects of ubiquitination and thereby stabilize the expression of various proteins that often are otherwise degraded via the proteasome. The effects of genetic or pharmacologic targeting of various DUBs on immune responses are largely unknown. Using a novel screening approach, we have developed genetic and pharmacologic data that point to a key role for the DUB, USP7, in control of murine Treg suppression in vitro and in vivo, without concomitant suppression of protective T cell responses. With a sharp focus on the translational potential of these findings, we propose to determine the effects of USP7 inhibition in murine models of lung cancer, using genetic and pharmacologic approaches. In particular, our studies in immunocompetent hosts will assess whether USP7 targeting can dampen Treg functions and allow host immune responses to now limit the growth and spread of tumors. Our studies could have major consequences for the development of new strategies for immunotherapy in patients with malignancies, and may also have relevance to the management of patients with HIV or other chronic infections.  "
"9626058","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Viruses have been the cause of some of the greatest epidemics in human history including smallpox and AIDS. Although viruses must circumvent the host immune response in order to establish infection, the viral factors and mechanisms by which this occurs are largely unknown. Insights into these viral strategies can be harnessed by understanding the evolutionary dynamics of host genes. I am utilizing the cGAS/STING pathway, which serves as a first responder in poxvirus, herpesvirus, and HIV-1 infections, as a model to uncover the strategies used by viruses and host immunity to counteract each other. Upon binding viral DNA, cGAS generates the second messenger cGAMP, which activates a signaling cascade via STING leading to interferon expression. In this proposal, I aim to build off of my previous postdoctoral work in which I used evolutionary and phylogenetic principles to characterize recurrent cGAS adaptation in response to selection imposed by pathogens. During the K99 mentored phase I will be investigating the role of cGAS spliceforms that I identified in the evasion of viral-mediated inhibition and regulation of host immunity. In contrast, I am also focusing on the first viral factor directly implicated in the inactivation of cGAS signaling, whichI discovered, and its role in viral replication. Further building on my initial work on cGAS, I am using signatures of positive selection to identify new immunity factors. To date, I have several candidate genes which are rapidly evolving in a manner similar to other critical immunity factors such as Protein Kinase R and APOBEC3G. In addition to my work investigating the cGAS-viral interface, these rapidly evolving genes will serve as a platform during the R00 phase to launch my independent research program. Combining my past training in human genetics with Dr. Haig Kazazian Jr. and evolutionary biology with Dr. Nels Elde with my new training in virology facilitated by this K99 award, I will be able to address diverse biological problems. My research program aims to not only aid in treating viral disease but genetic disorders like lupus. Moreover, my laboratory will be an integrated reflection of my academic experiences at Southern Illinois University, University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins, and University of Utah. To date my success over the years can be attributed to the fine mentors and opportunities I have been provided. Thus, to drive and enrich my research program, I will continue to seek out mentoring opportunities as I have over the years. I will continue this tradition by running a multi-disciplinry and collaborative lab by providing frequent informal and formal opportunities to discuss science and by recruiting trainees from multiple graduate programs with emphasis on making fundamental discoveries using evolution- guided approaches in basic science and virology."
"9541454","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cholesterol is an important metabolic precursor, regulator, and component of cellular membranes. Exogenous cholesterol is acquired principally through receptor-mediated endocytosis of cholesteryl ester-laden low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and trafficked to the lysosome where it is distributed to other cellular organelles. While it is well established that bulk export of lysosomal cholesterol is dependent on lysosomal protein NPC1, NPC1- dependent and lower flux, NPC1-independent post-lysosomal cholesterol trafficking pathways are poorly understood. This is, in part, due to a lack of suitable cholesterol trafficking probes. Diazirine-alkyne (DA) functionalized probes are structurally minimally modified and enable tagging and enrichment of protein targets for identification by mass spectrometry. DA-probes provide a powerful new tool for the discovery and study of previously elusive post-lysosomal cholesterol trafficking pathways. I hypothesize the specific itinerary and metabolic fate of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol involves multiple, distinct distribution pathways and is mediated by proteins associated with the limiting lysosomal membrane and non-lysosomal trafficking proteins associated with diverse subcellular compartments. In Specific Aim 1 I will characterize novel DA-cholesterol probes that I have developed as tools for the study of cholesterol trafficking. In Specific Aim 2 I will use validated DA-probes to identify proteins involved in the post-lysosomal cholesterol trafficking network. To specifically assess post- lysosomal trafficking, DA-probe will be delivered in reconstituted LDL. Knock-out analysis of key trafficking nodes, coupled with biochemical trafficking assays will position identified proteins in specific trafficking pathways. In Specific Aim 3 I will identify lower flux, NPC1-independent post-lysosomal cholesterol trafficking pathways in NPC1-deficient cells using the labeling approach described. A proteomic strategy combined with biochemical assays will be used to determine the fate of released cholesterol. The long-term objective of this project is to elucidate the major nodes through which lipoprotein-derived cholesterol trafficks from the lysosome. This goal aligns well with the mission of NHLBI and may lead to discovery of novel targets for treating both genetic (e.g., NPC disease) and acquired (e.g., atherosclerosis) cholesterol storage disorders."
"9361255","Project Summary  One major hallmark of aging and age-associated diseases is the inability to activate cellular quality control mechanisms after exposure to endogenous and exogenous oxidative damage, which if not removed, can wreak havoc upon cellular DNA, lipids, and proteins. The accumulation of cellular damage can accelerate the aging phenotype. Therefore, the characterization of regulatory mechanisms of the adaptive stress response (ASR) remains an important goal of aging research.  Cells rely upon the ASR for the transient and reversible response to mild oxidative stress (resulting from metabolic and environmental conditions) to activate stress responsive genes, thereby enabling cells and organisms to cope with a wide array of cytotoxic conditions. The ASR consists of two components: the immediate activation of stress responsive genes for damage removal, followed by the time-delayed inactivation of the response, when no longer necessary. A master transcriptional regulator is Nrf2, which upon oxidative stress transcriptionally activates protective pathways and enzymes to counteract cytotoxic conditions. Bach1 acts as a time-delayed transcriptional suppressor of Nrf2 signaling to inactivate the ASR. However, with increasing age Nrf2-target gene expression declines, contributing to cellular dysfunction, damage and senescence.  Historically, the primary approach to reduce the age-dependent Nrf2 decline was focused on Nrf2 overexpression or the suppression of its cytosolic inhibitor Keap1. Unfortunately, these approaches have failed to restore the ASR and, in some instances, proven detrimental. Instead, Bach1 may play a crucial role in restoring the ASR, as supported by its age-dependent increase. I hypothesize that reducing/removal of Bach1 signaling in later life will allow for Nrf2 signal amplification and the restoration of the Nrf2- mediated adaptive stress response. I propose to investigate the age-dependent change in Nrf2/Bach1 signaling upon oxidative stress in 3 model systems (human primary cells, D. melanogaster, and mice) (Aims 1- 3). Additionally, I will seek to restore the age-dependent decline in the Nrf2-mediated ASR by Bach1 inhibition (direct) and caloric restriction (indirect), as caloric restriction has been previously reported to reduce the age- associated increase in oxidative stress (Aims 2 & 3). Together, this exploration will offer an alternative approach for restoration of the ASR with age, with the potential for slowing the aging process and/or disease progression."
"9495759","PROJECT SUMMARY  The overall goal of our proposed work is to study the underlying pathomechanisms of a repeat expansion found in C9ORF72 that causes frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Indeed, various studies have shown that C9ORF72 is bidirectionally transcribed and the RNA repeat expansions have toxic gain-of-functions. Our studies will comprehensively characterize the RNA gain-of- function, defining therapeutic targets and pathways. These studies will be enabled by the development of small molecule chemical probes that inhibit RNA toxicity. Core B will support the efforts of all three projects to speed therapies and biomarkers to c9FTD/ALS patients.  Core B consists of three components: medicinal chemistry, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, and three cores (Genomics/Next Generation Sequencing, Proteomics, and Imaging). Core B will be spearheaded by The Scripps Research Institute's Translational Research Institute (TRI). TRI combines basic research with advanced technology platforms to develop potential lead compounds that can prevent, treat or cure disease. TRI works closely with the Scripps Florida academic departments to bring translational approaches to bear on complex biological problems and is comprised of Discovery Biology, Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics (DMPK), TRI-Informatics, Lead Identification and HTS, and Medicinal Chemistry. The Specific Aims are:  Aim 1: Hit-to-lead optimization: synthesis of compound derivatives. Core B will be responsible for the design and synthesis of second/third generation compounds based on studies completed in Project 1 (in vitro potency, cellular selectivity, inhibition of foci formation and RAN translation in cellular models) and Project 2 (activity in patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells).  Aim 2: Evaluation of compounds as in vivo chemical probes: Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics (DMPK). While potency and selectivity against the target are vitally important, optimization of compounds for in vivo applications (as in Project 2) requires a detailed understanding of the molecule and its liabilities. Thus, Aim 2 will fully characterize DMPK profiles for lead optimized compounds from Aim 1 to identify the most suitable in vivo chemical probes and to guide further refinement of lead compounds.  Aim 3: Proteomics, Next Generation Sequencing, and Imaging. The remaining three components of Core B are Next Generation Sequencing (Genomics), Proteomics, and Imaging Cores, which will support studies proposed in all three project, ranging from exploring RNA metabolism and splicing caused by the c9FTD/ALS repeat expansion to identification of protein components of foci to studying nuclear pore and transport abnormalities."
"9537978","Project Summary: Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are innate-like ?? T cells that use conserved T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements to recognize lipid antigens in the context of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I-like molecule CD1d. Analogous to the classical Th1, Th2, and Th17 helper T cell subsets, NKT1, NKT2, and NKT17 cells have been described with stereotypical cytokine production profiles, transcription factor expression, and tissue localization. The vast majority of iNKT cells in C57BL/6 mice are NKT1 cells, which reside in the liver and spleen and produce high amounts of IFN? and IL-4 when activated by a combination of TCR and innate cytokine signals.  Many reports have described iNKT cells in the context of proinflammatory immune responses where they respond to danger signals and microbial lipid antigens to mediate host defense. In contrast, we recently identified a distinct role of iNKT cells in adipose tissues of mice and humans where they display a unique regulatory phenotype. Maintenance of the non-inflammatory state in adipose tissue is essential to preserve insulin sensitivity, prevent diabetes, and control obesity. We found that adipose iNKT cells produce high levels of IL-2 that drives the expansion of adipose Tregs and IL-10 that drives M2 macrophage expansion. These iNKT cell functions contribute significantly to the anti-inflammatory adipose microenvironment, and in the absence of iNKT cells mice are prone to obesity and diabetes. Furthermore, specific activation of adipose iNKT cells with the lipid antigen ?-galactosylceramide (?GalCer) induces weight loss and ameliorates many metabolic abnormalities caused by obesity. Interestingly, adipose iNKT cells have a distinct transcriptional profile and lack expression of the PLZF transcription factor, which is expressed in iNKT cells in all other organs. Instead, they express the transcription factor E4BP4 that drives their production of IL-10.  We have several lines of evidence to indicate that the regulatory properties of adipose iNKT cells are induced by exposure to the adipose microenvironment. The goal of this proposal is to identify components of adipose tissue that drive the unique regulatory phenotype of adipose iNKT cells. In line with this goal, we propose to first characterize the ability of adipose tissue to induce and maintain the regulatory iNKT cell phenotype in vivo using adoptive transfer experiments (Aim 1). Then, we will analyze the contribution of adipocyte CD1d expression to the phenotype of adipose iNKT cells (Aim 2). Finally, we will identify molecules released by adipose tissue induce E4BP4 expression in iNKT cells and endow them with regulatory capacity (Aim 3). Combined, these studies will identify environmental and molecular inducers of regulatory iNKT cells that will 1) reveal new pathways to target these cells in autoimmune diseases and 2) offer insight into the biology of an adipose-resident immune cell population that can be manipulated for the treatment of metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes."

"9617570","Project summary This proposal represents an opportunity to directly study in vivo how the intermediary metabolite nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) contributes to the onset of age-related pathologies, due to its limited local availability. NAD+ is critical for cellular metabolism and for prolonging health in old age. Decreased steady- state NAD+ levels have been linked to human pathologies such as neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. However, NAD+ concentrations are highly compartmentalized by cell type, subcellular localization, and protein-bound or free fractions. Thus, a lack of methods to directly monitor free NAD+ in cells with spatial and temporal information has hindered our learning about the relevant pools, threshold concentrations, and timing that NAD+ may undergo leading to disease onset. This precludes our ability to identify treatments or approaches to intervene before NAD+ levels are misregulated.  To address this roadblock, we have developed a genetically-encodable fluorescent biosensor for free NAD+. Targeting of the sensor to subcellular compartments has revealed compartmentalization of intracellular NAD+ that is differentially coordinated in different cell types. Excitingly, the data also pointed to the existence of a putative mammalian mitochondrial NAD+ transporter. We believe the sensor can address key problems in aging with the hypothesis that misregulation of mitochondrial NAD+ is a major underlying cause of late-onset pathologies. This proposal will use the sensor to identify the proteins required for mitochondria to sustain their elevated concentrations of NAD+ and how this pool may be altered in older neurons. This has important implications for understanding cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial health, as well as identifying new options to combat neurodegeneration. Understanding how local NAD+ levels fluctuate and may limit the function of NAD+-dependent enzymes is important to evaluate whether NAD+ regulation represents a viable treatment approach or intervention for age-related diseases."
"9515943","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and hypertension are major risk factors for developing chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Despite intense research, the mechanisms that underlie the pathways to renal hypoxia and CKD remain poorly under- stood. That dif?culty may be attributable to the complex interplay among the millions of renal tubules and vessels that forms the basis for the integrative function of the kidney but that remains to be fully characterized. We have previously developed computational models of the rat kidney that represent the complex interactions, and we aim to extend those models and to conduct simulations that will provide insights into the kidney in health and disease. The proposed project includes (I) To develop a detailed and multiscale computational model of integrative rat kidney function, and to use that model to examine key determinants of kidney function and medullary oxygenation. Simulations of functional knockout and nephron loss will be conducted to determine: What are the necessary nephron structures and functions that must be preserved or should be inhibited to maintain or increase oxygen balance in the vulnerable outer medulla, while maintaining overall key kidney functions? (II) To simulate and gain insights into the pathophysiology and therapeutics of renal hypoxia in hypertension and diabetes. Hypertension and diabetes induce unique effects on the tubular system that increases kidney oxygen consumption. Model simulations will be conducted to investigate factors that impact intrarenal oxygen tension (PO2), particularly in the vulnerable outer medulla, including hypertension-induced shift in Na+ transport to the more distal and less ef?cient nephron segments, elevated oxidative stress, diabetes-induced hyper?ltration and tubular hypertrophy and hyper-reabsorption. We will simulate and investigate the effectiveness of current and novel therapeutic treatments and seek to answer questions like: How can one increase Na+ excretion in hypertension while limiting effects on other kidney functions and preserve medullary oxygenation? In diabetes, what is the in?uence of inhibiting Na+-glucose cotransport on renal NaCl transport and O2 requirement? To what extent do pressure reduction maneuvers increase medullary PO2 and protect the kidney? (III) To conduct experimental studies to assess the renal effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibition. Inhibiting glucose reabsorption along the proximal tubule via SGLT2 is a novel approach for lower blood glucose level in diabetes. We will perform experiments on mice to determine: Does SGLT2 inhibition enhance Na+ transport of vulnerable downstream nephron segments and increase outer medullary hypoxia? Is there any bene?t in the additional inhibition of SGLT1 along the late proximal tubule, which limits Na+ glucose reabsorption along that segment, but may further increase thick ascending limb Na+ transport? Does SGLT inhibition facilitate ischemia- reperfusion injury or impair the recovery? At the completion of these studies, we would have gained new insights into the key determinants of kidney function and medullary oxygenation in the normal kidney, and determined their potential relevance in the pathways from hypertension and diabetes to CKD."
"9530646","Project Summary The current senior design program provides undergraduate Biomedical Engineering (BME) students a comprehensive, hands-on design experience that aims to equip them with relevant skills for future careers in industry, research and professional/graduate education. To further enhance and optimize the senior design experience, the proposed research education program consists of integrating principles and practices of engineering design throughout the curriculum. One motivation for introducing design earlier into the curriculum is to provide opportunities for students to gain specific skills that may be used in their senior design project, but ultimately in their careers. This will be accomplished through the development of nine skills-building modules that were identified based on both informal and formal feedback from students, enhancements to incorporate additional design components to current lower division core curriculum courses, and a 6-week summer innovation internship for selected students to be actively engaged in the innovation process. The proposed research education program provides an opportunity for faculty and students to engage in cross-campus, multidisciplinary efforts. Our ongoing collaborations with the UC Davis Medical Center, School of Veterinary Medicine, and School of Management will be further strengthened, as we seek to build upon the successes and lessons learned from our previous award."
"9672844","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI is a faculty member of the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at Stony Brook. His research focuses on spontaneous and evoked neural activity in the gustatory cortex. The candidate recently transitioned to neuroscience from a theoretical physics background. This award will provide the necessary five-year protected period for the candidate to receive training in systems and theoretical neuroscience and electrophysiological techniques, under the supervision of the proposed mentorship committee. By the end of the termed period, the candidate will achieve his long term career goals of successfully applying for independent research funding and becoming an independent investigator in the field of theoretical neuroscience. The goal of the proposed research plan is elucidating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity in the gustatory cortex, and its modulation by anticipatory cues. Spontaneous neural activity in sensory cortices, traditionally regarded as a noisy baseline, is increasingly drawing attention: it can predict trial to trial variability; it contains information on the functional architecture of neural networks; and it was characterized as either a repertoire of possible network activities or a storage of expectations of sensory stimuli, shaped by development. In the context of taste processing, however, it has received little to no attention. The aim of this proposal is to elucidate the properties of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex. This is an ideal system, due to the rich temporal dynamics of responses to taste stimuli, represented in terms of taste-specific sequences of patterns of activity, synchronized across the whole neural population. The first goal of the proposed plan is to employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to elucidate the features of spontaneous activity in relation to evoked activity. This will provide new analytical tools for the characterization of spontaneous activity and reconcile within a single framework the different views currently held in the literature, by introducing the new feature of temporal dynamics. As a second goal of the proposed project, the role played by anticipatory cues in modulating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity will be elucidated, and the dependence of reaction times on spontaneous activity will be clarified. A biologically plausible model of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex will be introduced, based on networks of spiking neurons. This model will yield a mechanistic understanding of the feature of spontaneous activity as revealed by the analysis of electrophysiological data."

Regional Alliance for Sustainable Development (RASD Rwanda) and University of Rwanda (UR) College of Medicine and Health Sciences (UR-CMHS) propose to collaborate with Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, MO, USA (WUSTL) to implement a mélange of long-, medium-, and short-term tailored didactic and hands-on training, balanced for Master's (MS) degree and non-degree face-to-face mentorships. We will provide MS in Clinical investigation training to postdoctoral scholars, followed by 3-months Mentored Career Development Fellowships, MS in Biostatistics, and MS in Biochemistry Laboratory Medicine. Research training in Endocrinology and Metabolism and advanced nursing techniques will be provided, plus technical training in stable isotope tracer methodologies for substrate kinetics measures, and echocardiographic measures of vascular and cardiac function. WUSTL Faculty assisted by previously trained mid-career Rwandan co-mentors will provide 4-weeks hands-on intensive didactic training to 15 mid-career investigators in Advanced Epidemiology & Biostatistics in Year 1, using existing Ministry of Health HIV datasets, resulting into publications. In Year 2, 4-week intensive workshop training to develop Grant Writing Skills will occur followed by post-training mentorships. Promising young and mid-career scientists will benefit from regular, custom-tailored and flexible mentoring from senior WUSTL Faculty and Rwandan co-mentors (the mentored become mentors) to enhance the research culture at UR-CMHS, while Rwandan co-mentors will gain a breadth of skills from more experienced Faculty to train junior scientists- a pool of future mentors. We envision that 4 WUSTL Faculty will mentor 4 young scientists each, resulting in 16 successful mentorships annually, with up to 80 mentorships in 5 years. Trainees' unique HIV research projects will be supported to accelerate novel findings. Furthermore, WUSTL Summer Fellowships (8 weeks) in the Public Health Advanced Summer Education Program for Research in Global Health, and Bench Fundamentals for Translational Laboratory Research course will each accept 2 trainees/year. Upon return to Rwanda, all trainees will be integrated into the vibrant HIV research infrastructure to contribute to rigorous investigations, and to eventually enable UR to become an African scientific leader in cardiovascular and metabolic research associated with HIV, nutrition, obesity, diabetes and other related co- morbidities, with improved independent scientific capacity to attract and manage grants, and ability to inform global community on HIV care and practice."
"9690943","Project Summary/Abstract This proposal describes the continuation of the Training Program in the Neuroscience of Human Cognition at Northwestern University, a program currently in its initial 5-year funding cycle. A multidisciplinary group of 34 faculty preceptors has been assembled to participate in training the next generation of cognitive neuroscientists. These scientists conduct research exploring a wide variety of human cognitive functions, including language, memory, perception, attention, emotion, motivation, problem solving, action planning, social cognition, executive functions, aging, and development. The program is led by Ken Paller (Director) and Marsel Mesulam (Associate Director), with the assistance of an internal Steering Committee and an External Advisory Committee (Ron Mangun, Marcia Johnson, John Jonides, and Larry Squire). Each year a competitive selection process will identify 4 predoctoral students who have advanced to candidacy for the PhD and 4 postdoctoral trainees, typically for 2 years of support each. They will be joined each year by 3 predoctoral affiliate trainees who receive funding provided by Northwestern Graduate School. Trainees conduct their research under the guidance of one or more of the 34 preceptors from 6 of the separate schools and colleges that make up Northwestern University (Arts & Sciences, Communication, Education, Management, Medical School, and Music). Faculty have primary affiliations with the following departments: Communication Sciences and Disorders, Education, Finance, Linguistics, Music, Neurology, Physiology, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Psychology, and Radiology. Thus, the training program brings together a diverse set of perspectives on human neuroscience with a broad range of research and training opportunities. Trainees are selected on the basis of their proposed research activities, their future scientific potential, and the excellence of their prior coursework and scientific training. Mentorship from multiple faculty members is encouraged, particularly when the breadth of Cognitive Neuroscience research at Northwestern can be expanded through the kind of novel interdisciplinary approaches made possible when a student bridges the distinct areas of expertise of two mentors. Concerted efforts focus on including under- represented minorities and on fostering a diversity of perspectives. This funding mechanism encourages faculty and students to explore innovative strategies and novel methodological combinations, and it enhances the sense of community for all involved in cognitive neuroscience at Northwestern. Faculty regularly monitor the progress of trainees through formal advising and evaluations, opportunities for written and oral scientific communication, and other aspects of career development. Training instills a solid understanding of responsible conduct in science and of the ethical issues that will confront cognitive neuroscientists in the coming decades. A chief goal of the program is to provide top-rate comprehensive training to young scientists who will become future leaders in cognitive neuroscience."
"9486853","Abstract The thiopeptide antibiotics are an emerging class of natural products that exhibit formidable activity against drug resistant, Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin- resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. These natural products are highly modified, sulfur-rich, cyclic peptides that feature a central nitrogen-containing six-membered ring of differing degrees of saturation that is tri- or tetra-substituted. Additional modifications include multiple thiazole or oxazole rings, and dehydro-amino acids. These antibiotics are generated from a precursor peptide that is synthesized ribosomally and then modified by a number of tailoring enzymes. One of these enzymes, NosN, a Class C RS methylase involved in the biosynthesis of nosiheptide, catalyzes the methylation of a carbon atom of a 3-methylindolic acid (MIA) molecule that becomes attached to the thiopeptide framework. The mechanism by which this reaction takes place is unknown, and is the focus of much of the proposed work. Additionally, the timing of attachment of the MIA moiety to the thiopeptide framework is unknown and will be similarly addressed by recapitulating the biosynthesis of the thiopeptide in vitro."
"9462097","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affects African Americans. Two recent discoveries suggest that common, African-specific genetic risk factors are particularly relevant in CKD susceptibility. Variants in the gene encoding apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) and the presence of a single copy of the sickle cell mutation (sickle cell trait, or SCT) both increase the risk of CKD progression. How these variants confer kidney risk, whether there is gene-gene interplay, and the identity of any causal intermediates is unknown. The proposed studies will use two complementary cohorts of African Americans with CKD, the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) and a subset of BioMe, to investigate these questions. The AASK study is arguably the most comprehensively phenotyped of African Americans with CKD in the world, assessing participants' kidney function every 6 months for up to 12 years (and up to 17 years for end-stage renal disease and death). BioMe is an ongoing, contemporary cohort of patients receiving medical care in New York City, with substantial resources devoted to biospecimen collection and genotyping. The analysis will build upon our prior work in genetic risk factors for CKD by investigating novel variants and their relationship to kidney function decline as well as gene-gene interplay in risk for adverse CKD outcomes. In addition, we will study the relationship of metabolomic patterns - a snapshot of the end-product of cellular processes - with CKD outcomes. This analysis can lead to identification of novel and potentially modifiable risk factors for CKD outcomes. When combined with genomic data, the metabolomic consequences of genetic risk variants such as the APOL1 high-risk genotype or SCT can be studied. In addition, analytic techniques can help distinguish whether metabolomic risk factors cause adverse CKD outcomes or are simply a byproduct of an associated process. Understanding the relationship between genomics, metabolomics, and outcomes will advance knowledge regarding pathogenic pathways and potentially modifiable targets in CKD progression, particularly in African Americans, an ethnic group disproportionately affected with advanced CKD."
"9444596","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Age-related hearing loss is a substantial national problem due to its high prevalence and significant psychosocial consequences. Although hearing aids (HAs) are the primary intervention for the management of age-related hearing loss, only 15?30% of those who could benefit from HAs actually seek them out. HA adoption rates are even worse for people with lower income and for racial and ethnic minorities. One of the most commonly reported reasons for people not seeking HA intervention is the high cost of HAs and the associated audiological fitting services. Because HAs fitted using the audiologist-based service-delivery model (AUD model) are unaffordable, more and more Americans (1.5 million in 2010) purchase amplification devices via over-the-counter service-delivery models (OTC models) to compensate for their impaired hearing.  Although OTC amplification devices are gaining popularity and are regarded as an important option for promoting accessible and affordable hearing healthcare, it is unclear if they are viable solutions for age-related hearing loss as OTC models exclude professional services. Further, if there are outcome differences between AUD and OTC models, it is unknown if the clinical improvement in outcomes will be offset by the improved value (outcome relative to cost), or if it is possible to identify appropriate candidacy for each model to ensure optimal patient care for all. Finally, no prior research has investigated if ?hybrid? service-delivery models, in which professionals provide streamlined services to fit OTC amplification devices, offer affordable and quality amplification interventions as has been recently advocated. The overall goal of this project is to characterize the differential effect of service-delivery models on provision of amplification so that accessible and affordable hearing healthcare can be facilitated. This project proposes to conduct research that would provide new knowledge about the outcome, value, and candidacy of OTC, hybrid, and AUD models and the effect of professional evaluation/selection services, patient- centered services, and device-centered services on outcome and value. The proposed study will acquire this knowledge through a two-site, double-blinded, randomized controlled field trial. The results obtained will inform patients and hearing healthcare providers about what can be achieved with different service-delivery models, and will help us develop guidelines to facilitate the selection of the most appropriate and cost-effective intervention for a particular patient. The significance of the proposed project from the public health point of view is that it will facilitate not only accessible and affordable, but also quality, hearing healthcare."
"9478972","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The goal of this proposed clinical-translational study is to not only advance nursing science, but also the skin fibrosis field by (1) elucidating crucial molecular pathways driving fibrosis and (2) correlating them with patient-centric outcome measures of disease severity. Because scleroderma or systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an extreme phenotype of fibrosis, extensively related to skin, it presents an opportunity to translate the methods and results of animal studies of skin fibrosis and wound healing for use in human studies. Capitalizing on existing microarray gene expression data and matching clinical assessment data from (1) SSc patients and (2) normal and SSc patient skin fibroblasts, our multidisciplinary team proposes to apply high-throughput genomic technologies to investigate the interplay between chemokines and extracellular pathways. Our three specific aims are as follows: (1) To identify the genes involved in chemokine-modulated progression of fibrosis, we propose to (a) identify differentially expressed genes between fibrotic stimulated fibroblasts treated with chemokine cocktails and (b) validate gene expression profiles by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry; (2) To identify the genes that participates in chemokine modulation within the context of fibrotic severity (we predict that chemokines modulate the change the fibrotic process in fibroblast and hypothesize a direct correlation between distinct chemokine profiles and degree of fibrotic), we propose to (a) use a global approach to measure the changes in the gene expression profile before and after chemokine cocktail treatment of SSc patients fibroblast and (b) correlate the profiles with modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS), which is the clinical assessment of severity of skin thickening; (3) To explore the genes in the chemokine pathway that differentiate severity of fibrosis in SSc tissue biopsies (we postulate unique chemokine gene signatures that not only regulate fibrosis, but also influence disease severity), we propose to (a) investigate possible relationships between chemokine gene alterations and fibrotic outcomes and (b) correlate patient SSc mRSS scores with chemokine signaling pathways using three large SSc studies gene expression data available from the publicly available database Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)."
"9591352","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The oncoproteins Mdm2 and its recently discovered family member Mdmx are frequently overexpressed in many human cancers. Both Mdm2 and Mdmx bind and are direct regulators of the p53 tumor suppressor, but their regulation of p53 activation is only partially understood. Moreover, Mdm2 and Mdmx also have other oncogenic functions that are not well characterized and that likely impact p53 activation and significantly contribute to tumorigenesis. Specifically, altered expression of either Mdm2 or Mdmx can lead to genome instability, which is a hallmark of cancer and facilitator of tumor development; however, the mechanisms for this remain unresolved and appear to have both p53-dependent and p53-independent components. Preliminary data suggest novel mechanisms of Mdm2 and Mdmx in the regulation of p53 and the DNA damage response. Therefore, we hypothesize that alterations in these functions of Mdm2 and Mdmx significantly contribute to their oncogenic activity that leads to genome instability and tumor development. We propose to investigate this hypothesis with three Specific Aims. Experiments in Aim 1 utilize innovative approaches to define the novel functions of Mdm2 and Mdmx that result in genome instability during tumorigenesis and the proteins and pathways required. Experiments in Aim 2 will evaluate a novel mechanism of p53 regulation by Mdm2 and Mdmx with multiple approaches, including a new mouse model. Experiments in Aim 3 will capitalize on the novel functions of Mdm2 and Mdmx in targeting an Achilles' heel in cancer cells, and will identify synthetic lethal combination for cells that have lost a functional Mdm2/Mdmx-p53 pathway. Results from these Aims will reveal critical insights into the oncogenic functions of Mdm2 and Mdmx and their roles in tumorigenesis. Our studies should also open new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of the 50% of human cancers that have inactivated p53."
"9488569","ABSTRACT Genetics and genomics research are rapidly generating scientific discoveries, technological advances, and clinical applications, each with important implications for medicine and public health. In order for the promise of the ?genomics revolution? to be achieved, however, numerous ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) will need to be proactively addressed. Since 1990, the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) has funded an ELSI Research Program focused on areas including ethical dilemmas in genomics research, integration of genetic testing in healthcare settings, and legal, regulatory and public policy challenges. The ELSI Program's recent inclusion in the broader NIH Institutional Training Grants Program (T32) signals a recognition of the need to train the next generation of ELSI researchers to face the growing challenges and opportunities posed by advances in genomics research. The University of Michigan (UM) Training Program in ELSI Research will help meet this need by providing integrated, interdisciplinary instruction for predoctoral and postdoctoral scholars. We propose to support two predoctoral and two postdoctoral fellows per year. Each fellow will participate in an individualized, 2-year course of training that will provide mentoring, knowledge and skills in areas including 1) the current state of genomic science and medicine; 2) core principles and frameworks in bioethics; 3) quantitative and qualitative research methods; 4) grant writing and manuscript preparation; and 5) the implementation of interdisciplinary ELSI research projects. The training program will be based in the UM School of Public Health, in close collaboration with units in the UM Medical School including the Center for Bioethics & Social Sciences in Medicine, and the Department of Human Genetics. The training program will feature a team of 18 faculty mentors with vast experience in ELSI research and/or clinical genetics and a proven track record of NIH- funded projects and research mentoring; these mentors possess expertise across relevant disciplines including bioethics, clinical psychology, genetic counseling, genetic health / risk communication, health education, health law, health services research, medical decision-making, medical genetics, medical sociology, oncology, pediatrics, public policy, science / technology studies, and statistical genetics. The proposed training program will also draw upon the considerable resources of the University of Michigan, including the career development programs of the Michigan Institute for Clinical & Health Research, research methods training opportunities at the Institute for Social Research, and institutional support from the Rackham Graduate School."

Given the rising rates of obesity and cancer worldwide, and the challenges for many people to lose excess weight, I propose an integrated multilevel approach to address four critical questions that will lead to new, effective mechanism-based interventions to offset obesity-associated increases in cancer burden: i) Does moderate weight loss alone, or in combination with other mechanism-based interventions, reverse the procancer effects of obesity? ii) What are the mechanisms of (and solutions to) obesity-induced chemotherapeutic resistance? iii) What are the targets and strategies for offsetting the pro-metastatic effects of obesity? iv) What new targets for offsetting the effects o obesity can be identified by deconvoluting (and ultimately disrupting) the reciprocal crosstalk between adipocytes, macrophages and epithelial cells? The overarching goal is to capitalize on our expertise in energy balance and cancer research (including well-characterized preclinical models of breast, colon and pancreatic cancer and well-established collaborations spanning molecular/cellular biologic approaches to clinical trials and epidemiologic studies) to elucidate mechanistic targets, identify new biomarkers that can be used in parallel human and animal studies, and develop effective interventions to break obesity-cancer links and reduce the burden of cancer in obese people."

All Case CCC members have formal access to this jointly managed SR."
"9478534","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Scleroderma (Systemic Sclerosis, SSc) is a devastating multiorgan disease with a prevalence of approximately 250 cases per million people in the US. The hallmark features of SSc include fibroproliferative vasculopathy, immune dysfunction, and extensive skin and organ fibrosis. Despite extensive clinical and pathological findings concerning vascular dysfunction, the mechanism underlying vascular disease and the relationship between vasculopathy and other disease manifestations is poorly understood. The progress in this area is hampered by the heterogeneity of the disease and the lack of the animal models that adequately represent the complex nature of SSc. Based on extensive studies that implicated deficiency of transcription factor Fli1 in SSc vasculopathy and fibrosis, we have established a transgenic model of SSc that recapitulates many of the vascular features of SSc and shows evidence of increased susceptibility to fibrosis. In addition, we developed an inducible model of dermal fibrosis based on Angiotensin II infusion that is characterized by vascular injury, inflammation and fibrosis, thus recapitulating the principal features of SSc. The proposed studies will test the hypothesis that persistent endothelial cell injury, in part mediated through activation of the TLR4/PKC?/Fli1 pathway, is a key pathogenic event that leads to myofibroblast activation and fibrosis in SSc. The studies will include investigation of the molecular mechanisms of LPS/TLR4 induced endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), with the emphasis on the PKC?-Fli1 axis combined with the comprehensive analyses of the new SSc mouse models. To further substantiate the pathological role of the PKC?/Fli1 pathway we will determine whether blockade of this pathway is therapeutically effective in reducing vasculopathy and fibrosis in animal models of SSc.  We propose the following specific aims: 1: To determine the molecular mechanism of LPS/TLR4-induced activation of endothelial cells focusing on the role of PKC?/Fli1 as mediators of this process. 2: To elucidate the relationship between vasculopathy and fibrosis using mouse models of SSc. 3: To determine the therapeutic potential of novel PKC? inhibitors in reducing vasculopathy and fibrosis in vivo."
"9476950","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Although routine endoscopic screening and early surgical intervention has reduced the incidence of CRC mortality, the five-year survival rate of patients with advanced disease is less than 10%. Genomic studies have suggested key genes that drive CRC initiation and progression but this information has yet to produce effective new therapies, in part, because current models to validate cancer drivers and new therapeutic targets in CRC are slow and cumbersome. This proposal aims to develop and utilize new murine models of colorectal cancer (CRC) to define genetic requirements for cancer progression and therapy response. To this end, we implement a novel approach to validate cancer drivers and therapeutic targets using orthotopic colon stem cell transplants that form focal colon tumors and progress to malignant disease. This circumvents the problems associated with transgenic mouse models, which i) rarely develop colon tumors and ii) do not live long enough to develop metastases due to small intestinal tumor burden. We have previously developed a robust model of APC loss in the colon using short hairpin RNAs targeting APC and showed that APC loss is required for disease maintenance of the primary tumor (14). My plan focuses on two future directions from that study: i) to test if Apc restoration in later CRC stages (Stage II, III, or IV will result in disease regression, and ii) to test if Smad4 mutations abrogate the dependence on hyperactive WNT signaling conferred by Apc loss in CRC. Successful completion of the project will produce new CRC models, validate potential cancer drivers, and identify key determinants that influence the action of WNT pathway inhibitors."
"9491586","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A goal of our research is to understand interactions between the immune system and skeletal muscle that are important in regulating muscle repair, growth and regeneration. By better understanding these relationships, therapeutic manipulations of the immune system or its products can be designed to improve muscle growth and regeneration following acute trauma, disuse or chronic disease. Over the last several years, knowledge in this area has advanced substantially, showing that immune cells called M2 macrophages play a major role in muscle growth and regeneration. However, the identity of the specific, M2 macrophage-derived molecules that drive regeneration remains unknown. We propose to test the novel hypothesis that the protein Klotho generated by M2 macrophages is essential for normal growth and regeneration of muscle following injury. In addition, we will develop a novel, cell-based mechanism for targeting Klotho to injured muscle on demand, so that expression of the therapeutic protein is elevated specifically at the location and time of muscle regeneration. We propose to use an acute, muscle-injury model in mice to address the following aims: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that genetic or pharmacological interventions that modulate Klotho levels affect muscle regeneration. We will manipulate Klotho levels in mice that experience muscle injury by expressing a Klotho transgene, by ablating the Klotho gene, by transplanting bone marrow-derived cells (BMCs) from Klotho transgenic mice and by administering Klotho protein. Mice will be assessed by molecular, physiological and morphological assays to determine the effects of modified Klotho levels on muscle growth and regeneration. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that Klotho modulates shifts in inflammatory cells from pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to pro-regenerative M2 macrophages following muscle injury. We will test whether genetic or pharmacological manipulations of Klotho affect macrophage phenotype or function following muscle injury. Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that myeloid cells can be designed to target elevated Klotho expression to injured muscle during regeneration. We will generate a transgenic mouse line in which Klotho expression is driven by a promoter that is most-highly activated in myeloid cells in the context of inflammation and then assay whether transplanting BMCs from those mice promotes growth and regeneration of injured muscle in the recipients. We anticipate that these findings will establish the importance of Klotho in driving growth and regeneration of injured muscle. We also believe that this work can provide a basis for a new, cell-based delivery of therapeutic molecules to sites of injury and repair that may have significance beyond the treatment of muscle injuries."
"9506698","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this study is to determine the interaction between Plk1 and B-Raf in melanocytic cells with the idea that this interaction plays a critical role in melanocytic transformation.  Constitutively active oncogenic B-RafV600E mutations play an important role in melanomagenesis. However, B-Raf mutation alone are insufficient for melanocytic transformation, suggesting the involvement of other factors. Synthetic lethality, derived from the concept of `gene interaction', is gaining popularity towards developing new means and targets for certain diseases, including neoplastic conditions. Two genes are said to be synthetic lethal if mutation of either of them alone leaves the cell viable, while simultaneous modulations leads to a different fate for the cells. Thus, one gene buffers the effect of changes in the other to compensate for the effect of its deletion. This concept can help in identifying i) the buffering relationships among interacting genes, and ii) the malfunction and diseases that may occur when these relationships are altered. Exploring these relationships may lead to information how cellular processes work when the protein products expressed by two different genes have an effect together but not separately. Identification of interacting partner of B-Raf will provide a better understanding of mechanism of melanocytic transformation as well as identification of novel approaches to combat melanomagenesis. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) plays pivotal roles in multiple aspects of cell division (mitosis). We have shown that compared to normal melanocytes, Plk1 is overexpressed in transformed cells and its targeted inhibition causes mitotic catastrophe and induction of apoptosis in melanoma cells, suggesting that Plk1 possibly plays an important role in melanocyctic cell proliferation. Significantly, our preliminary data show that melanocytic cells harboring B-Raf are hypersensitive to Plk1 inhibition than cells with wild type (WT) B-Raf, and that inhibition of B-RafV600E decreases cellular response to Plk1 inhibition. Based on our published and preliminary studies and available literature, in this application, we propose to challenge our central hypothesis that Plk1 acts as a synthetic lethality interaction partner of the oncogenic B- Raf. The following specific aims are proposed: 1) To determine the association between B-Raf mutation and Plk1 expression during melanocytic transformation; 2) To determine the extent to which the oncogenic B-Raf mutation enhances the sensitivity of the cellular response to mitotic stress, 3) To compare Plk1 loss-of-function phenotypes in melanoma cells with different B-Raf backgrounds; and 4) To assess the effects of Plk1 inhibition in a xenograft model with varying B-Raf. Outcome of this study is expected to enhance our understanding of mechanism of melanocytic transformation via dissecting interaction between Plk1 and B-Raf. This will be useful in designing novel strategies against proliferative melanocytic disorders, including melanomagenesis."
"9494521","Abstract  Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the largest major surgical procedure by volume for Medicare, and infection is the largest reason for TKA revision. Irrigation and debridement (I&D) with long-term antibiotics is the preferred method to manage periprosthetic joint infection (PJI; infected TKA). I&D fails in approximately 60% of cases. The high failure rate of I&D is a result of the high tolerance of biofilm to antibiotics. There is a large gap in knowledge in how biofilm develops antibiotic tolerance, how it is regulated, and there are no strategies to disrupt this tolerance in PJI. The hypothesis of this proposal is that bacterial persisters, a subpopulation of bacteria phenotypically resistant to antibiotics, are a major factor responsible for this tolerance and the high failure rate of I&D. In other diseases of chronic infection (ie tuberculosis and cystic fibrosis), bacterial persisters have been well-recognized to increase biofilm tolerance to antibiotics and prevent eradication of the infection. Demonstrating bacterial persisters are present in PJI biofilm is the first step in developing treatment strategies.  The aims include establishing the presence of bacterial persisters in biofilm of PJI and identify potential therapeutic strategies to decrease biofilm antibiotic tolerance for later clinical trials. Preliminary results in this proposal demonstrate bacterial persisters provide a major contribution to biofilm antibiotic tolerance, and that this tolerance is associated with increased toxin-antitoxin expression in vitro. In Aim 1, a clinical study will be completed to determine whether these same results are observed on clinical samples. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of toxin-antitoxin systems in PJI biofilm antibiotic tolerance in the animal model we have developed. In Aim 3, the efficacy of a new class of antibiotics, ADEP4, that is not dependent on active metabolism or a positive energy state to eradicate bacteria will be quantified. This will add further evidence to the role of bacterial persisters in PJI and offer an additional new therapeutic strategy for later clinical trials.  The research plan is tightly integrated with a five-year career development plan where Dr. Urish will be mentored by a multidisciplinary team of research and clinical investigators in orthopaedic surgery, microbiology, and biostatistics. Mentors were selected based on already existing relationships, methodological expertise, and success in mentoring previous junior investigators. The mentoring team is a tremendous strength in this proposal as they compromise a diverse and complimentary skill set. To achieve his training objectives, a combination of classes, workshops, and conferences scheduled throughout the proposal will provide the foundation to acquire new skills in advanced bacterial genetic techniques, analysis, and their application into translational clinical studies. Together, the generated preliminary data and mentoring will create a foundation for Dr. Urish?s transition to independence with R01 funded research."

"9536599","Project Summary Sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a leading cause of acute respiratory failure in critical illness. Morbidity and mortality are high and there are no proven pharmacologic therapies other than antimicrobials. Increased permeability of the pulmonary microvascular endothelium is a defining pathogenic feature that leads to acute pulmonary edema and lung dysfunction in sepsis-associated ARDS. Although the mechanisms that regulate microvascular permeability are an area of intensive research effort, the proximal triggers of increased pulmonary microvascular permeability in sepsis-associated ARDS are not well understood. There is a vital need to identify these early triggers of increased microvascular permeability in sepsis, both to enhance our understanding of pathophysiology, and critically, to identify new therapeutic targets for prevention and early treatment of sepsis-induced ARDS. Our recent translational studies in patients, the isolated perfused human lung, and mouse models of sepsis have identified cell-free hemoglobin (CFH) as a key proximal mediator of increased microvascular permeability that (1) is released into the circulation in over 80% of patients with severe sepsis, (2) is independently associated with mortality in patients with severe sepsis, (3) has potent effects on pulmonary microvascular permeability across our model systems, (4) can be oxidized in clinical and experimental sepsis to highly reactive ferryl (4+) hemoglobin, a potent oxidant, and (5) can be mechanistically targeted by the hemoprotein reductant acetaminophen. Furthermore, preliminary studies suggest that oxidant-mediated mitochondrial injury and activation of apoptosis in endothelial cells are key mechanisms through which CFH mediates its effects on microvascular permeability. The studies in this proposal will build on this preliminary work to characterize the mechanisms by which CFH triggers increased pulmonary microvascular permeability in sepsis. Our primary goal is to translate these findings to new targeted therapies that will be tested in our novel human lung model as preparation for rapid translation to clinical trials in sepsis. In Aim 1, we will study the cellular and physiologic mechanisms by which CFH increases microvascular permeability and acute lung injury in the isolated human lung and clinically relevant models of sepsis-induced ARDS. In Aim 2 we will study primary pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells along with our in vivo models to define the molecular mechanisms by which CFH induces endothelial apoptosis. In Aim 3, we will test the therapeutic potential of targeting oxidized CFH with acetaminophen in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells and clinically relevant models of human and murine sepsis-induced ARDS. The studies proposed in these aims have the potential for major and sustained scientific impact. Targeting CFH for early prevention and treatment of ARDS in sepsis is a new approach that could have a major impact on clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the focus on acetaminophen as a targeted therapy for increased microvascular permeability due to oxidized CFH could repurpose an inexpensive, and safe compound for treatment of sepsis."
"9483127","Healing of large residual long bone defects associated with trauma, infection, irradiation, wear particle disease and other conditions is still an unsolved clinical challenge. These bone defects often will not heal due to their size, injury to the periosteum and endosteum, and insufficient numbers of osteoprogenitor and vascular progenitor cells. Autologous bone grafting is the gold standard for treatment, however this source can be limited in quantity or quality, and accompanied by morbidity at the harvest site. Another approach is to combine autologous harvested and concentrated progenitor cells with an appropriate scaffold to provide the elements for bone healing. We recently showed that preconditioning of MSCs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) to induce acute transient activation of NF-?B enhances osteogenesis, and improves MSCs' ability to polarize macrophages from a pro-inflammatory (TNF-?+, iNOS+) to a more favorable anti-inflammatory pro-tissue healing (Arginase 1+, CD206+, IL1Ra high) phenotype. We have also genetically modified MSCs (hereafter termed GM MSCs) to over express the anti-inflammatory, pro-tissue healing molecule Interleukin-4 (IL-4), and furthermore created a construct to first sense NF-?B activation and then increase production of IL-4 (NF-?B sensing and IL-4 secreting GM MSCs). These GM MSC would be very beneficial for bone defects in which low-grade subacute/chronic inflammation is also present, a scenario frequently seen clinically. The purpose of this grant is to accelerate the healing of long bone defects via immune modulation using preconditioned MSCs and GM MSCs, in a unique injectable macroporous scaffold, transplanted directly to the bone defect site. Specific Aim #1: To determine whether transplanted preconditioned MSCs, GM MSCs, and preconditioned GM MSCs delivered via a novel injectable macroporous hydrogel scaffold are better than autograft bone with respect to in vivo healing of: SA1a: an acute critical size murine long bone defect; SA1b: a chronic critical size murine long bone defect Specific Aim #2: To demonstrate that the above principles of enhancing the healing of acute and chronic long bone defects are valid for: SA2a: male and female mice; SA2b: younger and more elderly mice Specific Aim #3: To compare the most promising of the MSC treatments with autograft bone in a more challenging chronic critical size defect in larger and older animals: male and female elderly NZ white rabbits. We expect that addition of preconditioned or GM MSCs in a novel scaffold will lead to similar bone healing at sacrifice, compared to addition of autograft bone, but superior to addition of unaltered MSCs. Treatment with primed preconditioned or GM MSCs is highly innovative, mechanistic and directly translational to traumatic and acquired acute and chronic long bone defects in humans, and may be an effective, less invasive alternative to conventional bone graft techniques."
"9511919","PROJECT SUMMARY Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the most disabling, chronic psychiatric disorders, with a lifetime prevalence of 2-3%. Emerging findings point to a significant role for basal ganglia circuits in OCD. Despite this, our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of OCD remains inadequate, and our treatment options leave most patients with continued impairment. The best-replicated genetic finding in OCD is association with SLC1A1, encoding the neuronal glutamate, aspartate, and cysteine transporter EAAT3/EAAC1. However, the impact of this gene on the normal and abnormal functioning of OCD-related circuits is unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed a STOP-TetO knock-in mouse line that allows us to flexibly manipulate Slc1a1 expression. Using dopamine agonists as a probe, we found that EAAT3 loss decreases basal ganglia-mediated repetitive, stereotyped behavior. Our convergent data support the hypothesis that increased EAAT3 function plays a role in OCD pathology and that decreasing EAAT3 activity may serve as a novel treatment option. Little is known, however, about EAAT3's molecular and functional impact in the basal ganglia. Elsewhere in the brain, EAAT3-mediated transport decreases neurotransmission at perisynaptic glutamate receptors and provides substrate for GABA and glutathione synthesis, but it is unclear which of these functions is important in basal ganglia circuits, and whether EAAT3's impact on dopaminergic neurotransmission is pre- or post-synaptic. Using our flexible mouse model and previously established OCD optogenetic and transgenic mouse models, this R01 will 1) examine effects of EAAT3 ablation and targeted rescue on basal ganglia function and repetitive behavior, and 2) determine if EAAT3 ablation leads to symptom resolution in phenotypically-similar but etiologically-independent mouse models of OCD with abnormal basal ganglia signaling. These data could be leveraged to demonstrate a clear treatment target that motivates development of promising EAAT3 inhibitor lead compounds."
"9461505","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud (UB) to generate the renal collecting duct system is a critical process for the formation of a normal urinary tract and kidney. Abnormalities in this process cause birth defects such as renal agenesis or hypodysplasia, low nephron number, or congenital obstructive uropathies. Low nephron number may promote the progression of renal diseases and the development of hypertension. Thus, a better understanding of the genetic controls and cellular events underlying UB branching could lead to new strategies to prevent such birth defects, repair renal damage, or grow artificial kidneys. While many of the genes required for normal UB branching morphogenesis have been identified, ultimately it is the specific cell behaviors controlled by these genes that cause correctly patterned epithelial growth and branching. These cellular behaviors are, in general, poorly understood. This project focuses on the role of GDNF signaling through the Ret receptor, a signaling event that is critical for kidney development in mice and humans. Our recent studies show that the branching UB epithelium undergoes extensive cell rearrangements, many of which are controlled by Ret. We hypothesize that these cell rearrangements are a major force driving normal UB branching. We seek to describe the nature of these cell movements, their control, and their importance for kidney development, using a variety of state-of-the art genetic and imaging technologies.  We propose to use several genetic methods to label individual, wild-type ureteric bud cells with fluorescent proteins, or to generate labeled clones of mutant UB cells in developing kidneys. We then follow their behaviors during renal development in culture, via high-resolution, 4-dimensional (4D) time-lapse imaging. In Aim 1, we investigate the importance of a new type of cell motility, linked to mitosis, which occurs in the UB tip epithelium. We ask if these mitosis-associated cell movements are non-random in direction, if they influence the developmental fate of the daughter cells, and if they are disrupte by mutations in several candidate genes. In Aim 2 we perform global 4D tracking of every nucleus in a branching UB tip, thus analyzing in unprece- dented detail the variety of cell movements that occur during normal, as well as abnormal, UB branching. We also investigate the extensive protrusive activity in UB tip cells, observed in high-resolution imaging studies, and examine its role in epithelial cell motility. In Aim 3, we use several powerful methods of clonal genetic analysis to continue our investigation of how Ret signaling, as well as the activity of several genes acting upstream or downstream of Ret, influences cell movements during UB branching. Overall, the proposed research should advance the field by more deeply elucidating the role of GDNF/Ret signaling in UB cell behaviors; by providing a thorough picture of cell motility in the UB epithelium, its regulation, and its contribu- tion to normal and abnormal branching morphogenesis; and by providing new tools, methods and paradigms for studying how other genes and signaling pathways affect the behaviors of renal epithelial cells in vivo."

"9488775","DEVELOPMENTAL THERAPEUTICS (DT) RESEARCH PROGRAM PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Developmental Therapeutics (DT) Research Program develops and evaluates novel therapeutics and combinations that: 1) overcome drug resistance of cancer cells mediated by a spectrum of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms; 2) inhibit growth and drug-resistant pathways of cancer; and 3) utilize novel immune checkpoint therapeutics to increase the proportion of cancer patients who benefit. The overall approach of the DT Program is to leverage the creativity and expertise of basic scientists in the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC) Programs by analyzing new agents for specific validated molecular targets and new therapeutic compounds for preclinical and clinical validation in early-phase clinical trials. DT members guide their development, and convey clinical samples back to laboratory investigators to drive further discovery. This bidirectional interchange enables DT's continued role as a major convener of new therapeutic concepts for the Center?s Programs. The program is organized around 3 scientific aims: (1) Interrogate cancer pathways to develop new efficacious therapeutics; (2) Implement early-phase clinical trials around novel pathway targets, new agents and combinatorial approaches; and (3) Implement early-phase trials around novel approaches to cancer immunotherapies, to widen their activity spectra. These aims reflect major working groups and initiatives that coalesces program members with other cancer center investigators through inter-programmatic collaborations that result in preclinical and clinical research efforts, grants, and trial protocols. Extensive use of an array of shared resources, in particular Translational, Cytometry, Imaging, Proteomics, and Drug Discovery facilitate all aspects of member discoveries. Under the leadership of Yogen Saunthararajah (Co-Leader) and John Letterio (Co-Leader) the DT Program has 52 members including 18 full, 5 associate and 29 clinical members representing 21 different departments across the consortium. Members are funded by a total of $12.5M in research grant funding (annual direct costs), of which $5.1M is peer-reviewed and $2.9M is NCI-funded. Between 2012 and 2016, DT program members published 1,012 publications. Cancer and program related publications included 35% inter- programmatic, 25% intra-programmatic, 14% inter- and intra-programmatic and 10% that involved collaborations with another Cancer Center. This highly effective Program has made major practice-changing contributions benefiting cancer patients. Examples include: discoveries of first-in-class compounds (SMARCA5 inhibitor, PP2A activator, malate dehydrogenase inhibitor, base excision repair target with methoxyamine); discoveries targeting EGFR resistance, inhibition of uracil glycosylase and the inhibition of the BH4 domain of Bcl-2; analysis into the genetic markers of resistance to radiation; and identification of several small cell lung cancer genetic subsets. !"
"9671602","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This resubmission of a NEW INVESTIGATOR led longitudinal study is in response to (PA-11-104) and will examine: (1) the impact of (GXE) genetic and psychological environmental factors (discrimination, depression, and parenting behaviors) on the health of African American (AA) children aged 3 through 5 years and (2) the GXE risk for hypertension (HTN) in AA women and children. The overall goal of this project is to delineate the psychobiological (GXE interaction) mechanisms through which AA mothers' perceived racial discrimination, mental health, and parenting behavior affect their own and their young children's blood pressure (BP) over time. Our research will examine both genetic (candidate gene and epigenetic effects) and psychological (maternal perceived racial discrimination, mental health, and parenting behavior) interaction effects on BP on this population. We will employ a psychobiological approach by: utilizing psychological and biological assessments using a longitudinal cohort research design, a 2-step candidate gene and epigenetic methodology, and use of ancestry informative markers to account for population stratification admixture to explore GXE interactions on BP in AA mothers and children. Data analysis for the study will be conducted using multiple mixed modeling, cross-validation, and false discovery rate methods. We will enroll 250 AA children aged 3 through 5 years and their (n=250) mothers/maternal caregivers. We will assess mother and child factors every six months for 2 years. We propose the following: Aim 1: Examine the GXE interaction and epigenetic effects of mothers' perceived racial discrimination and its influence on BP over a period of two years. Aim 2: Examine the GXE interaction and epigenetic effects of mothers' mental health status [symptoms of depression] and its influence on BP over a period of two years. Aim 3: Examine the GXE interaction and epigenetic effects of mothers' parenting behavior and its influence on BP over a period of two years. Our project supports NINR's mission to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, communities, and populations by conducting basic research on the health and illness of women and young children. The proposed research extends nursing science by integrating the biological (genetics) and behavioral (psychology) components that can inform the combination of multi-level factors that contribute to AAs having the highest incidence of HTN in the US.

We are proposing to develop such a Probe using our background and experience in optogenetics in the peripheral nerve, bio-imaging and compact multiphoton microscope design. Current neuro-modulation approaches for the vagus nerve are generally all or nothing events that cause simultaneous changes in heart rate, for example, along with changes in pancreatic function.  We propose to develop a novel compact Optogenetic based Optical Probe capable of optically neuromodulating individual afferent and/or efferent axons within nerves of the parasympathetic, or peripheral, nervous system. We seek to read-in or read-out from these nerves with the goal of modulating organs or brain circuits innervated by them.  Our central premise is that we can use optics to communicate with axons in a nerve. For optical approaches to work we need to convert action potentials into an optical signal. This can be done using reporter proteins or by some other means that is ancillary to action potential generation. Because nerves do not naturally express optical proteins, we will work with transgenic mice that express these proteins and use these mice to refine our system before making it available for other researchers to use.  We will develop a bench-top Optical instrument that can be shared with other research teams to allow us, and them, to interrogate specific fascicles and axons within mouse, and ultimately human, nerves. Our goal here is the vagus nerve and its innervation of the pancreas. The vagus nerve is one of the main conduits into the parasympathetic nervous system. The ability to interface with this nerve gives one the ability to neuromodulate the viscera in one direction and the brain in the other. We are proposing to couple an optical fiber with an electrowetting lens head to allow remote interrogation the vagus nerve with a bench top (i.e. portable) laser system. Integration of miniature (1mm diameter) scale electrowetting electrically tunable optics with an optical fiber-based imaging system will enable two-photon fluorescence imaging of neuron activity by readout of a fluorescent indicator.  We will work with our collaborators in the field of pancreatic research to test, refine and demonstrate our ability to activate/report from in-vitro mouse vagus nerves and to see if we can control and/or sense pancreatic responses in the absence of other responses, such as a change in heart rate, using targeted neuro-modulation of specific axons in the vagus in in-vivo transgenic mice experiments."
"9488777","CANCER PREVENTION, CONTROL AND POPULATION RESEARCH (CPC) PROGRAM PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the Cancer Prevention, Control and Population Research (CPC) Program is to develop and evaluate interventions that reduce the incidence and improve the outcomes of cancer in the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC) catchment area and beyond. Program members establish novel approaches in risk reduction, screening, and early detection. They also conduct research to implement and monitor improved delivery of recommended preventive services, therapies, and survivorship care after cancer diagnosis. The program is organized around 3 scientific aims: (1) Discover strategies and develop and implement behavioral interventions to reduce cancer risk and improve outcomes after cancer diagnosis; (2) Evaluate and facilitate effective cancer screening, surveillance and treatment policies and their impact on practice and the healthcare system; and (3) Discover and characterize genetic and environmental factors linked to cancer. These aims reflect major working groups and initiatives that coalesces program members with other cancer center investigators through inter-programmatic collaborations that have impacted paradigms for patient care, health policy and the larger cancer research community. Extensive use of an array of shared resources, in particular Biostatistics, Cancer Outcomes, Genomics, and Tissue facilitate all aspects of member discoveries. Under the leadership of Gregory Cooper (Co-Leader) and Susan Flocke (Co-Leader) the CPC Program has 38 members including 30 full, 1 associate, and 7 clinical members. Members represent 20 departments, giving rise to a total of $10.8M in grant funding (annual direct costs), of which $8.2M is peer-reviewed and $2.3M is NCI-funded. Between 2012 and 2016, CPC program members published 1,174 publications. Cancer and program related publications included 25% inter-programmatic, 16% intra-programmatic, 6% inter- and intra- programmatic and 11% that involved collaborations with another Cancer Center. This highly effective Program has successfully created synergy among Case CCC CPC members and collaborations with investigators in other research Programs as evidenced by new initiatives in cancer prevention in underserved urban populations, tobacco control, new approaches to colon cancer screening and prevention, palliative care of patients with advanced cancer, and cancer risk in HIV infected individuals."
"9481720","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; WHO Group I) is a disease of the small pulmonary arteries, characterized by vasoconstriction, vascular proliferation, and remodeling. Over the first 4 years of our translational Program Project Grant (tPPG), we have focused on the less studied sub-phenotypes of pulmonary hypertension, namely pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH or Group II), which typically arises in the setting of the metabolic syndrome. Group II PVH is also referred to as pulmonary hypertension in the setting of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (PH-HFpEF) and is extremely common, with no currently approved effective therapies. It has become increasingly apparent that major risk factors for the development of both Group I disease and Group II (PH-HFpEF) include all features of the metabolic syndrome (obesity, insulin resistance, and systemic hypertension). Importantly, both the relaxation and abnormal proliferation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and the central mechanisms underlying the metabolic syndrome are strongly modulated by nitric oxide (NO)-dependent reactions, inducing both cGMP-dependent vasodilation and cGMP-independent reactions that inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation, inflammation, and oxidative stress, as well as improve insulin sensitivity. In Project 1 it is hypothesized that new vascular-targeted, NO-based therapeutic strategies will enhance the treatment of PAH and metabolic syndrome, providing a new therapy for the currently untreatable and extremely common PH-HFpEF. To this end, we have identified two reactive nitrogen species that potently modulate both PH and the metabolic syndrome, nitrite (NO2-) and nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FA). In our preliminary data we find that nitrite (NO2-) can be bioactivated in skeletal muscle, via the myoglobin oxidoreductase reaction, to activate mitochondrial SIRT3- AMPK-Glut4 signaling pathways to improve glucose homeostasis and reverse established PH-HFpEF. Interestingly, nitrite also activates AMPK in the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, independent of SIRT3 signaling, suggesting signaling convergence around AMPK. In addition to direct bioactivation of nitrite in smooth and skeletal muscle, nitrite reacts with dietary linoleic acid in the acidified stomach to generate nitrated fatty acids, which are potent electrophiles that post-translationally regulate Keap1-Nrf2 mediated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory signaling. We have now developed novel mouse and rat models of PH-HFpEF and have completed critical human phase 2 safety and proof of concept clinical trials of oral and inhaled nitrite therapy in patients with PAH. For the next phase of support we plan to study the mechanisms underlying the development of PH-HFpEF in the setting of metabolic syndrome. Fulfilling the translational directive of the tPPG, our project extends our completed phase 1 PK and safety studies to a randomized placebo-controlled trial of oral nitrite versus placebo for patients with PH-HFpEF, for which there is no currently approved therapy."
"9478539","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major bone disorder that affects both men and women during aging. The pathogenesis is not only due to the increased osteoclast activity in bone resorption, but also a decrease in bone formation mostly attributed to an insufficient supply of osteoblasts in the aged. Osteoblasts are non-replicative cells derived from the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) lineage. We hypothesize that the pattern of acquisition of bone mass during childhood, maintenance in adulthood, and loss with aging is due to decreased osteoblast availability for bone formation as MSCs lose/slow their ability to differentiate into osteoblasts with aging. Insulin like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1) is known to stimulate osteoblastic differentiation by activation of mammalian target of rapamycin to maintain proper bone microarchitecture and mass. Thus, a series of experiments and animal models are designed to confirm the hypothesis that MSC differentiation slows with aging, mediated by down- regulation of the IGF-1 signaling pathway. The first aim is to determine the temporal-spatial regulation of MSC differentiation into mature osteoblasts in young, adult, and old mice using a MSC lineage tracing mouse model. The second aim is to dissect how the IGF-1 signaling pathway is regulated during the lifespan and affects the fate of MSCs. The goal of the proposed study is to identify the rate limiting steps in the differentiation process so that future therapies can be targeted at these essential steps. This project will be conducted by Dr. Janet Crane under the guidance of Dr. Xu Cao in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Crane, a Pediatric Endocrinologist, is dedicated to a career in academia using basic and translational research to study factors affecting bone formation. Dr. Cao has an exceptional research career in bone biology using in vivo mouse models to study signaling mechanisms by which bone marrow MSCs contribute to bone homeostasis and remodeling, which will provide Dr. Crane with the training necessary to initiate her career as an independent investigator. The available resources and strong ongoing collaborative arrangements within the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, the Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, and the Department of Neuroscience provide a rich learning environment and are completely supportive of the academic advancement of Dr. Crane."
"9304874","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term goal of our research agenda is to identify the mechanisms associated with rotator cuff tendinopathy (impingement syndrome) and subsequently evaluate novel treatment strategies that address these mechanisms. The objectives of this application are to study the muscle patterns in patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy as well as the effects of both pain and exercise on these patterns. Our first hypothesis is that pain relief from a shoulder injection will result in increased rotator cuff actiity. Our second hypothesis is that patients with tendinopathy will demonstrate improved rotator cuff muscle activity following a six-week exercise program and that this improvement will be higher in patients that respond favorably to treatment. Our final hypothesis is that patients with cuff tendinopathy will show decreased rotator cuff activity compared to healthy subjects. We plan on addressing these hypotheses using several novel techniques for muscle activity assessment."
"9469483","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The collecting duct (CD) is the terminal segment of the nephron serving as the final determinant of sodium content in the ultrafiltrate. As such, the CD plays a key role in overall control of sodium excretion and blood pressure. CD epithelium consists of two major cell lineages, principal cells (PCs) and intercalated cells (ICs). In the traditional view, PCs are primarily responsible for sodium transport, whereas the main role of the ICs is regulating urinary acidification. However, recent studies have identified more complex functions for ICs including substantive sodium and chloride reabsorption. Here, we propose an additional role for ICs as a source of paracrine mediators inducing natriuresis and promoting resistance to hypertension. Specifically, in our preliminary studies, we discovered a pathway linked to AT1 angiotensin receptors (AT1R) in CD epithelial cells, most likely ICs, triggering expression of cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2, generating vasodilator prostaglandins, and attenuating the development of hypertension. Along with classical second messengers linked to G-protein activation, ligand binding to GPCRs, including the AT1R, can trigger ß-arrestins to activate alternative signaling pathways with distinct physiological effects. In this regard, we find that AT1R-dependent stimulation of COX-2 in isolated medullary CDs requires ß-arrestin 2. Based on our preliminary work, we have formulated two hypotheses: (1) Expression of COX-2 and production of prostanoids by ICs is a general protective mechanism providing resistance to hypertension by preserving renal blood flow and promoting natriuresis; and (2) Activation of COX-2 by AT1R in the CD is driven by ß-arrestin signaling, independent of canonical G-protein pathways. We will test our hypotheses through the following Specific Aims: (1) Characterize the capacity of COX-2 in intercalated cells to ameliorate the severity of hypertension. (2) Define the mechanism of natriuresis triggered by AT1 receptors in intercalated cells. (3) Define the contribution of ß- arrestin to the induction of COX2 in ICs. Through these studies, we will characterize molecular control of a novel pathway linked to resistance to hypertension and attempt to uncover strategies to manipulate its activity."
"9606563","Project Summary  A complete understanding of both normal brain function and neurological disorders / mental illness will require the deciphering of the complex brain networks that underlie behavior and cognition, at both whole-brain and microscopic scales. The difficulty of structurally and functionally mapping these brain networks in living human subjects with sufficient sensitivity and resolution to understand normal function and detect pathological change represents a fundamental challenge. Recognizing these challenges, the NIH and other funding agencies have supported new initiatives in brain mapping for decades, starting with the Decade of the Brain, followed by the Decade after the Decade of the Brain, the New Century of the Brain, the Human Connectome Project, and most recently the BRAIN Initiative. Most of these brain mapping initiatives have featured MRI, the premier tool for studying the intact living human brain, non-invasively, at high resolution, and with high sensitivity to many subtle physiological and pathological processes. For example, the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project (HCP) was launched in 2009 to comprehensively map brain circuitry in 1,200 healthy subjects using MRI, and has already had a large impact on the neuroscience field. The HCP uses diffusion MRI (dMRI) and BOLD-based functional MRI (fMRI) to derive whole-brain structural and functional connectivity maps for individual subjects at 1.25-2mm resolution (2-8µL voxels). Such coarse resolution results in the spatial blurring of single-voxel responses over 105-106 neurons. The NIH BRAIN Initiative calls for disruptive new approaches to resolving brain circuit connections and function at dramatically higher spatiotemporal and microstructure resolution. This 2-year proof-of-concept BRAIN R01 will focus on producing a complete and validated design for a next-generation, compact, low-cost, high-performance ultra-high-field (UHF) MRI system, capable of resolving neural connections and circuitry at the scale of 104 neurons (~0.2µL), throughout the entire living human brain non-invasively. This would address a specific target identified in BRAIN 2025, which calls for significant developments in MR methodology targeting whole brain studies with voxel volumes of 0.3-0.4µL in the short term, and 0.1µL or better in the long term. Our specific goals in this project are to re- engineer all front-end hardware components of the UHF MRI system, thereby resolving the technological and physics challenges that have been severely holding back this human brain imaging modality. We will develop several disruptive technologies, designed synergistically to create a dramatically lower cost but higher performing UHF MRI system: 1) ultra-compact UHF magnet technology; 2) ultra-high-performance gradient hardware; and 3) innovative shim and RF array technologies designed to fully correct both main field and RF inhomogeneity problems. The practical impact of our work will be to enable greatly improved human brain mapping using dMRI and fMRI, while simultaneously solving the major technological and cost limitations of UHF MRI."

"9558123","Abstract Significance: Infantile Pompe Disease (IPD) is an autosomal recessive glycogen storage disorder caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), leading to accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes, primarily in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles. Untreated IPD infants die within the first 2 years of life. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) improves survival and quality of life, but the development of sustained anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA) potentially reduces ERT efficacy. All IPD patients who have no GAA protein expression (circulating cross-reactive immunologic material [CRIM]-negative) are predicted to mount high titer ATA, and are treated with an intensive Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) regimen. While some CRIM-positive IPD patients become tolerized to ERT over time, over one-third of CRIM-positive patients still develop treatment-limiting ATA. There is currently no effective method for determining which CRIM-positive patients are at risk of developing treatment-limiting ATA, and would therefore benefit from treatment with an ITI regimen. This project will validate a recently developed algorithm, GAA-iTEM, for predicting the risk of ATA development for individual IPD patients, in a retrospective study of clinical data and in vitro studies of GAA T cell epitopes. Hypothesis: CRIM-positive IPD patients are tolerized to their own residual native GAA (nGAA) but may develop ATA to ERT with rhGAA. Using well-established computational tools to identify T cell epitopes in rhGAA which are predicted to stimulate CD4 T cells (and thus promote a T dependent B cell response to rhGAA), patients may be classified as high or low risk for the development of ATA. T cell epitopes that are cross-conserved between nGAA and rhGAA (and other endogenous epitopes) are unlikely to induce a T cell response. GAA-iTEM currently predicts ATA risk, using the patient?s HLA type and nGAA sequence. We propose to improve GAA-iTEM using newly accessible clinical data and samples. In Specific Aim 1, 40 CRIM+ IPD patients followed at Duke with defined ATA responses will be evaluated using GAA-iTEM to generate a patient-specific GAA-Individualized T cell Epitope Measure (GAA-iTEM) score. Clinical and genetic factors will be used to refine the predictive tool, which will be made available through a prototype graphical user interface to Duke clinicians, who will assess patient-specific risk and deposit clinical data for future calibration of the prediction algorithm. In Specific Aim 2, GAA CD4 T cell effector and regulatory epitopes identified in silico will be evaluated for HLA binding, cytokine stimulation, and generation of Tregs. Overall Impact: GAA-iTEM will provide researchers with an individualized assessment of a patient?s risk for developing treatment-limiting ATA based on their HLA haplotype and nGAA mutations, improving decision-making regarding ITI treatment. Once validated, the new GAA-iTEM would be used to assess ATA risk in a prospective study, and to develop ATA-risk assessment tools for related genetic disorders."
"9511268","Abstract The transition from replication to non-replication underlies much of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) pathogenesis, as non- or slowly replicating Mtb are responsible for persistence and latency and for the long treatment times required to clear Mtb infection. Defining the molecular programs that drive the transition to a state of slow or no replication is central for understanding Mtb pathogenesis and for discovering new drugs that can shorten treatment times. However, there are currently no effective tools to directly identify druggable enzyme activity in the non-replicating state. While previous studies have measured genome-wide transcript or protein abundance in non-replicating cells, these measurements are only approximations of biological activity. A powerful approach to directly measure global enzymatic activity is activity-based protein profiling (ABPP). ABPP directly measures biochemical activity of entire families of enzymes by recognizing a shared catalytic mechanism. This approach is particularly suited for the detection of serine hydrolase (SH) activity, a large enzyme family central to all aspects of metabolism that is extensively regulated by posttranslational modifications. The central role of SHs in many metabolic pathways makes SHs unique reporters for a broad cross-section of Mtb metabolism, and combined with their proven druggability, also tractable drug targets. We developed a chemical proteomics approach to directly measure global SH activity and to define the activity changes between replicating and non-replicating Mtb. We show that SHs are extensively regulated depending on Mtb's replication state. We defined three groups of coordinately regulated SHs in the Mtb life cycle, each indicating a different role in inducing or maintaining the non-replicating state. Here, we will test the hypothesis that a small group of coordinately regulated SHs active ONLY during non-replication are regulators of and potential drug targets in non-replicating Mtb."
"9474581","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoclasts are the body's sole bone resorbing cells. Pro-inflammatory T-cells, commonly called effector T-cells (TEFF), produce cytokines that stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts. Prolonged exposure to the inflammatory cytokines leads to osteoporosis. Normally, regulatory T-cells, TREG, counteract the activity of TEFF. TREG suppress TEFF, suppress inflammation and promote healing. We have recently discovered that osteoclasts can induce a novel class of TREG, belonging to the CD8 lineage. These regulatory CD8+ T-cells, termed TcREG, like the more extensively studied TREG of the CD4 lineage, also express the transcription factor FoxP3. We have demonstrated that TcREG can negatively regulate bone turnover and production of TEFF in a mouse model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Osteoclasts induce TcREG from naive CD8 T-cells, which then negatively regulate osteoclast numbers and activity, to form a negative feedback loop. TcREG could potentially be very important for maintaining and restoring skeletal and immune homeostasis. We propose, in the application to study the mechanisms underlying the negative feedback loop. We propose to first uncover the mechanism by which osteoclasts induce FoxP3 in CD8 T-cells. Knowledge of these mechanisms could be used to induce TcREG locally to treat chronic inflammation. Second, additional proposed experiments will reveal how TcREG negatively regulate osteoclasts. Insights into how TcREG suppress bone turnover in osteoporosis is likely to lead to new treatment modalities, with relevance to other bone erosion diseases. This approach would represent an entirely new and mechanistically distinct avenue than those currently in use or development."

"9477757","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The hypertrophy and remodeling of the heart right ventricle (RV) are key predictors of right heart failure in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) disease. These effects are induced by pressure overload in the RV and are associated with structural and mechanical changes of the RV free wall (RVFW) that eventually results in RV failure. New tools are needed to allow clinicians to use in vivo measurements of RV function into a model that can help predict the progression of this disease. Our long-term objective for this proposal is to improve our understanding on how the RV adapts to PAH, and to develop an experimentally- guided growth and remodeling (G&R) model that captures this adaptation. This model can be personalized using in vivo imaging data and thereby has the potential to provide the means for clinicians to predict the progression of RV hypertrophy and evaluate the efficacy of new clinical interventions. Recently, we developed a tissue-level constitutive (stress-strain) model that elucidates the relationship between structural and compositional arrangement in a healthy RVFW and its overall mechanical response; now there is a need to investigate how this arrangement at the cellular-level adapts to a chronic pressure overload, and what effects this adaptation has at tissue- and organ-level behaviors. Towards this goal, we propose to extend our model to a micromechanical model and to account for growth and remodeling response of the RVFW (Aim 1). We will then implement the model within a realistic computational setting and conduct comparisons with results from a rat model (Aim 2). Finally, we will use our model to quantify reversibility in a rat model of PAH subjected to an intervention (Aim 3). Three specific aims of this proposal are then summarized as: 1. Extend our current structural soft tissue constitutive model to a microstructurally accurate 3-D model and to include time-evolving hypertrophy and remodeling adaptation of the RVFW to a pressure overload 2. Develop an anatomically faithful FE model of biventricular rat heart and comparing the simulation results to in vivo data 3. Determine the point of 'no return' along the hypertrophy and remodeling progression by  investigating changes in wall stress in a rat model undergoing stem-cell treatment"

"9478547","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An estimated 200,000 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur in the United States each year. ACL injury results in instability, pain, damage to the meniscus, and early-onset osteoarthritis (OA). Although reconstruction is commonly performed after ACL injury, the long-term development of OA after surgery remains a major concern. This is a significant problem because of the young age of most patients undergoing ACL reconstruction (between 15 and 25 years old). Because early-onset OA is devastating to such a young population, there is an urgent need to reduce the incidence of non-contact ACL injuries, which comprise 70% of all ACL injuries. Although some prevention programs have demonstrated encouraging results, others have been less successful, and high rates of non- contact ACL injuries persist. This is likely due to conflicting data regarding the mechanisms of non-contact ACL injuries. A detailed understanding of what motions elevate ACL injury risk is needed to improve prevention strategies. Specifically, there is a lack of in vivo AC strain data during dynamic, high risk activities. Thus, the objective of this study is to identify what motions elevate in vivo ACL strains during dynamic activities that are high risk for ACL injury. An innovative methodology combining marker-based motion capture, MR imaging, and static biplanar radiography will be used to measure six degrees-of-freedom knee kinematics and ACL strains throughout the entire motion cycle of dynamic jumping and cutting tasks. In addition, these measurements will be confirmed using high-speed biplanar radiography, a technique capable of capturing a portion of the motion cycle near ground impact. Our aims will address three important risk factors for ACL injury. Females are up to eight times more likely to sustain an ACL injury than males. Additionally, those who have sustained a unilateral ACL injury are at elevated risk for injury to the uninjured knee (up to 15 time compared to controls). Lastly, recent studies also suggest that fatigue is a significant factor elevating injury risk. Therefore, ACL strains and knee kinematics will be compared between females and males (Aim 1), the uninjured knees of subjects with and without prior ACL injuries (Aim 2), and subjects before and after completing a fatigue protocol (Aim 3). Our overall hypothesis is that landing with less knee flexion and more valgus increases ACL strains and elevates ACL injury risk. Understanding what motions elevate in vivo ACL strains during dynamic activities is a critical first step in preventing ACL injuries. In particular, these measurements of in vivo ACL strains could be used to focus neuromuscular training programs on avoiding motions that predispose the ACL to injury. Furthermore, these data and this approach could be used clinically to identify individuals who are at high risk for injury and could be targeted for intervention. Thus, these data are essential to improving the efficacy of prevention programs. Reducing ACL injury rates is significant due to the devastating early-onset OA observed in these patients."
"9523485","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive single gene disorders. Individuals with CF carry loss of function variants in each CF Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. CFTR encodes a cAMP-activated chloride channel that ensures proper hydration and ion content of mucous secretions in the pulmonary airways and pancreatic ducts and maintains the correct concentration of chloride in sweat. Treatment of CF has taken a major step forward with the development of two classes of CFTR-targeted drugs. Ivacaftor (VX-770), a compound that potentiates the function of 33 variant forms of CFTR that are folded but inactive, has shown dramatic and lasting clinical effect. Lumacaftor (VX-809), a corrector compound, improves the folding of CFTR and demonstrates modest clinical efficacy in individuals with CF carrying the common disease-causing variant F508del. The success of these drugs indicate that we should be able to treat the vast majority of individuals with CF by targeting one or both of their CFTR variants. Several developments indicate that this goal is within reach. First, with near complete ascertainment of affected individuals by the CFTR2 project, we know that 520 variants account for 98.2% of CF alleles while the rest are `private', being reported in only one or two individuals worldwide. Second, in a major shift in policy, the Food and Drug Administration recently allowed expansion of the use of the CFTR-targeted drugs based on results of testing CFTR mutants expressed heterologously in immortalized cells. Third, we have developed and optimized a human airway cell line devoid of endogenous CFTR (termed CF8) for the functional assessment and drug response of heterologously expressed mutant forms of CFTR in a near native context. The overall goal of this application is to inform precision treatment by annotating every CF allele according to mechanism of effect, disease-liability and response to targeted drugs. This goal will be achieved by: 1) Determining disease mechanism, clinical consequences and drug response of CFTR variants to achieve annotation of 98.2% of all CF alleles reported to CFTR2; 2) Ensuring that the correct disease mechanism has been elucidated for missense variants that may also affect mRNA splicing or occur in cis with other potentially deleterious variants and 3) developing and testing predictive methods to determine disease liability and drug response of ~435 private missense variants in CFTR2. Upon completion of these aims, we estimate that 67,500 of the 70,000 individuals with CF worldwide will have mechanistic, clinical and drug response information for each CFTR variant they carry, 2,474 will have the same information for one variant leaving only 23 individuals with no information about either CFTR variant they carry. These data will be shared with the medical community and public on the CFTR2.org website. Our efforts to generate and test predictive approaches to variant annotation and drug response will provide information for rare and private CFTR variants that should inform similar efforts for all single gene disorders."

Our long-term objectives are to identify biobehavioral predictors of illness trajectory in BN-S so that treatments may be developed to address key factors influencing the severity and course of binge eating. The specific aims of this study are to test a model in which weight suppression (WS) leads to deficient circulating leptin, which contributes to blunted postprandial glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) response, which causes alterations in the RDoC core constructs of approach motivation and sustained responsiveness to reward, which then contribute to BN-S severity and maintenance. WS (the difference between an individual's highest weight and current weight) has emerged as one key predictor of severity and maintenance of BN-S, and investigators have posited a biobehavioral mechanism for this association. Yet, no study has evaluated how the biological consequences of WS may contribute to alterations in RDoC core constructs proposed to contribute to binge eating. Our model posits that the same set of physiological consequences of WS contribute to binge eating by 1) increasing drive/motivation to consume food (approach motivation), and 2) decreasing ability for food consumption to lead to a state of satiation/satisfaction (sustained responsiveness to reward). Approach motivation will be measured both behaviorally as breakpoint on progressive ratio tasks for food and non-food reinforcers and by self-report. Sustained responsiveness to reward (satiation) will be measured both behaviorally as food intake in an ad lib meal and by self-report. Participants (N=320) with BN-S and non-eating disorder controls, ranging in BMI from 16 to 35 kg/m2, will be assessed for WS, leptin, GLP-1 response to a fixed meal, approach motivation, ability to achieve satiation in an ad lib meal, self-report measures of core constructs, and binge eating at baseline, 6-, and 12-month follow-up, to produce the first study of biobehavioral predictors of illness trajectory in BN-S transdiagnostically. Examining the integration of approach motivation and satiation through the same set of physiological mechanisms represents a major innovation as it translates cutting-edge research in basic science to understand clinical phenomena in BN-S. If differences in illness trajectory across ANbp, BN, and BED are attributable to the underlying dimension of WS, this will fundamentally alter conceptualization of BN-S from three eating disorder categories to one eating disorder. If findings support biobehavioral distinctions across the BMI range, this would provide important information in what treatments would work in whom. Moreover, our focus on factors that are modifiable via behavioral and pharmacological interventions increases the public health significance of this work by facilitating novel treatment approaches to ameliorate distress, disability, and death in syndromes accounting for an important segment of those suffering from eating disorders."
"9447230","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Disruptive behavior disorders are prevalent in young children. Although highly effective parent training programs are available, only 3% of young children receive any mental health treatment. Ultimately, the reach of traditional parent training programs is limited. Technology is a promising tool for expanding the reach of parent training. The long-term objective of this K01 Research Scientist Development Award is to launch Dr. Kathleen ?Lucy? McGoron?s program of research as an independent investigator developing technology-based solutions for disruptive behavior in young children. Through this award, under the guidance of experts including Dr. Steven Ondersma as primary mentor, Dr. McGoron?s strong background in developmental psychopathology and traditional parent training will be enhanced by advanced training in 1) motivational mHealth interventions, 2) qualitative methodology to guide early mHealth intervention development, and 3) services research within the context of health care for children. Training objectives will be met through a comprehensive training plan involving 1) directed readings, 2) individual training and meetings, 3) coursework, 4) attendance at seminars, institutes, conferences, and meetings, and 5) a planned series of first-author publications. Knowledge gained will be implemented in a 3-part research project through which Dr. McGoron will develop, refine, and initially evaluate a two-part internet-based system called the ?Parenting Young Children Check-up? (PYCC). Level one of the PYCC will be a tablet-based initial check-up delivered during a health care visit; designed to identify child disruptive behavior and motivate engagement in more in-depth parent training. Level 2 of the PYCC is a tailored online parent training program adapting key evidence-based parent training elements. Phase 1 (Years 1 and 2) research activities will focus on the initial development of the PYCC using professional (12-20 participants) and parent (12-20 participants) qualitative data to guide decisions; Phase 2 (Year 2) will initially examine the system in a proof of concept trial (N = 5-15); and in Phase 3 (Year 4), a pilot randomized clinical trial (N = 40) conducted in Family Medicine offices will compare an intervention group that receives the initial check-up (level 1 of PYCC) to an assessment-only control condition on use of the parent training website (level 2), elements consistent with the theory of planned behavior, disruptive child behavior, and reported parenting. For the intervention group, satisfaction will also be examined. These initial steps will lay the foundation for a system that has the potential to reduce the public health burden of disruptive behavior disorders. The Merrill Palmer Skillman Institute at Wayne State University offers numerous resources and experienced faculty relevant to career development focused on technology-based parent training. An exceptionally strong external mentoring team and consultants will help to ensure the success of this award?s aims and establish Dr. McGoron as an independently funded (R01) investigator."
"9521377","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), which include solitary kidney and congenital renal hypoplasia, constitute the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children. Hyperfiltration is central to the progression of CKD in children. There is no specific treatment for hyperfiltration-mediated injury in children with CAKUT. Currently used regimens are extrapolations of treatments designed for adult patients to minimize kidney injury from hypertension, diabetes and proteinuria. The long-term goal of our research is to develop novel agents to attenuate the effects of hyperfiltration to delay the progression of CKD in children with CAKUT. Mice with lower nephron numbers will be used to understand the mechanism of, and to develop strategies for attenuating the hyperfiltration- mediated glomerular injury. Podocytes regulate plasma ultrafiltration from the glomerular capillary into Bowman's space. Increased ultrafiltrate along podocyte cell body causes fluid flow shear stress (FFSS) and capillary stretch causes tensile stress on podocyte foot processes. The shearing effect of FFSS on podocytes is not well understood. Unilateral nephrectomy (UNX) causes a 1.5-2 fold increase in FFSS in rodent models. FFSS increases COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis in podocytes, and glomerular albumin permeability. Of the four PGE2 receptors, FFSS upregulates only EP2, which in turn activates ?-catenin. Our hypothesis is that EP2 receptor blockade will attenuate the hyperfiltration-mediated injury. Proposed research under Aim 1 will determine the role of EP2 in FFSS-mediated glomerular injury using EP2 specific antagonist (PF-4418948) and agonist (ONO-AE1-259) in models of solitary kidney (UNX sv129 mice), congenital renal hypoplasia (ROP Os/+ mice), and EP2 null mice. Aim 2 will address the significance of EP2-mediated ?-catenin activation using mice with constitutively active ?-catenin in podocytes, TOPGAL mice with ?-galactosidase as a measure of in vivo ?-catenin activation, and the mice from Aim 1. Roles of EP2 and EP4 in FFSS and tensile stress will be distinguished using EP2 and EP4 antagonists and agonists. Results from Aim 3 will highlight temporal changes in urinary eicosanoids in children with solitary kidney and CAKUT. These data will validate findings from Aim 1 and form the basis for translational work. Overall, confirming EP2 as the principal receptor will lead to repurposing and development of specific agents to treat hyperfiltration-mediated glomerular injury in children with CAKUT."
"9486921","Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community."
"9530278","PROJECT SUMMARY: Role of intracellular membrane signalosomes in B cell NF-kB activation This proposal focuses on a novel mechanism that underlies NF-kB activation in peripheral B cell differentiation and, when dysregulated in autoreactive B cells, promotes pathogenic autoantibody responses in autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. As we contend, this mechanism is underpinned by the formation of intracellular membrane signalosomes (IM signalosomes), e.g., as mediated by the interaction of signal adaptor TRAF6, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, with Rab7, an endosome-tethered small GTPase, in B cells upon CD40 engagement. Our contention, if successfully tested, would lend a strong support to the emerging paradigm that IM structures relay signals to specify cellular processes. It would also identify a new target of therapeutics with less side effects, as disrupting IM signalosomes will not affect signals important for homeostasis.  In B cells stimulated with a CD40 or TLR ligand, TRAF6 plays an important role in NF-kB activation, which is required for AID induction and, therefore, Ig class switch DNA recombination (CSR) and antibody responses. As shown by our IM fractionation of B cells stimulated with CD154 (CD40 ligand), TRAF6 was ? unexpectedly ? localized mainly in mature endosomes, to which Rab7 was tethered. This, together with direct interaction and co-immunoprecipitation of TRAF6 with Rab7, as well as CD40 internalization and co-localization with Rab7, prompted us to hypothesize that IM signalosomes form on endosomes (through multi-valent CD40/TRAF6/Rab7 interactions) to mediate sustained NF-kB activation. This is supported by our studies using pharmacological inhibition and genetic ablation approaches, as CD154- and TLR-induced AID/CSR was hampered by a small molecule inhibitor of endocytosis (dynasore) or Rab7 (CID 106700), or Rab7 gene knockout, and CID 1067700- treated mice and B cell-specific Rab7 knockout (KO) mice show severely impaired antibody responses while B cell homeostasis and functions of other immune cells are normal. Finally, lupus B cells displayed more CD40 internalization and high Rab7 expression, consistent with our contention that IM signalosomes are dysregulated in these cells to promote NF-kB hyperactivation.  To test our hypotheses, we will analyze CD40/TRAF6/Rab7 interactions and TRAF6 K63 polyubiquitination on endosomes in normal B cells upon stimulation, and verify the block of these processes in C57/Rab7-KO- tdTomato B cells (Aim 1.1). We will further analyze CD40 internalization, high Rab7 expression and NF-kB hyperactivation in the same lupus B cells in humans and mice and characterize the human lupus B cell subset showing the highest Rab7 expression (Aim 1.2). Finally, we will blunt NF-kB activation by disrupting IM signalosomes in vitro and in vivo, through generation of a Rab7 mutant that cannot bind TRAF6 (Aim 2.1) and screening of small molecules to identify those inhibiting the TRAF6/Rab7 interaction (Aim 2.2), thereby hampering CSR and antibody/autoantibody responses. Successful completion of these experiments will bridge a significant gap of our understanding of signal transduction in an important pathophysiological context."
"9452887","Rotator cuff disorders of the shoulder are particularly devastating in the aging population with tears present in 50% of people over 60. Specific development and maturation processes, along with cues from the mechanical loading environment, generate and remodel tendon structure and composition throughout life. These processes are regionally-dependent, suggesting a complex spatially-dependent regulation of tissue homeostasis. During aging, normal maturation processes and mechanical influences can result in accumulation of sub-rupture damage and ultimately to tendon degeneration. The focus of this application is to determine the mechanisms by which this might occur. The development of tendon structure is dependent upon collagen I assembly into fibrils and higher order assemblies. This process is controlled by interactions involving collagen V, a quantitatively minor yet critical regulatory component of tendon. Recent studies demonstrated that altered fibril/fiber structure due to decreased collagen V content results in an inferior dynamic response to load and inferior macroscale function. Furthermore, there was a differential regulation of structure by collagen V at the insertion site and midsubstance of the supraspinatus tendon. The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate the differential regulatory role(s) of collagen V at the insertion site and midsubstance of the supraspinatus tendon both at maturity and during the aging process. Our general hypothesis is that regulation involving collagen V changes with aging. This results in site-specific regulatory roles due to altered content and distinct interactions resulting from differences in matrix molecules present and assembled at the two sites. We will test this hypothesis using targeted collagen V mouse models, which will define the role of an abnormal matrix in aging, as well as with novel collagen V inducible models, which will delineate the role of altered collagen V expression in the progression of tendon aging. The specific aims are to: Aim 1: Define the site- specific alterations in structure, composition, dynamic processes and mechanical function during normal supraspinatus tendon aging. Aim 2: Elucidate the site-specific differential roles of collagen V in determining aging-associated declines in supraspinatus tendon properties. Aim 3: Delineate site-specific hierarchical structure-function relationships as a function of collagen V content and aging utilizing sophisticated multiple regression models. An innovative approach using targeted and inducible mouse models will define the regulatory roles of collagen V during aging and in the establishment of regionally-dependent properties. This approach will be coupled with sophisticated and innovative measures of mechanical (including fatigue) and organizational properties, together with compositional profiles, to derive a mechanistic understanding of the governing processes."
"9476204","Core H: Rural Outreach Core Project Summary/Abstract The Rural Outreach Core (ROC) exists to raise awareness of Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia in the underserved rural counties in Missouri and neighboring Illinois and to support rural health care providers in caring for their patients with dementia. A secondary aim of the ROC is to recruit rural research participants. Missouri is more rural than the majority of other states with 37 percent of the state's population residing in rural communities. It is important for rural residents and the clinicians that serve them to have access to current information about AD and related dementias, as well as to have the opportunity to participate in AD research. The ROC aims for 2015-2020 are as follows: 1. To provide education for healthcare professionals and lay audiences in areas of rural Missouri and Illinois within the catchment area for the Knight ADRC (a radius of a 2 hour driving distance from the Knight ADRC). This catchment area aligns with the service area of the St. Louis Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association, with whom ROC partners on many of its outreach initiatives.  a) To conduct an annual Clinician Partners Program (CPP) at the Knight ADRC to intensively educate physicians, advance practice nurses and other healthcare professionals practicing in rural and semi-rural communities about Knight ADRC research, as well as provide up-to-date training about early recognition, diagnosis, treatment and management of AD and related disorders.  b) To provide educational talks to raise awareness in persons residing in rural areas about AD and related dementias and the research of the Knight ADRC.  c) To provide state-wide AD training in partnership with the Alzheimer's Association, with particular emphasis on the Ascertain Dementia 8 item informant interview (AD8) dementia screening tool to fulfill an initiative in the Missouri State Plan for Alzheimer's Disease.  d) To provide education regarding the assessment and management of demented drivers to rural health care providers, a need that has been consistently identified by our Clinician Partners.  e) To create a new section of the existing Knight ADRC website for use by CPP alumni and other healthcare professionals in rural areas to provide tools for use in clinical practice. 2. To recruit Knight ADRC research participants from rural areas in the Knight ADRC catchment area to increase research diversity and to allow underserved rural dwellers access to research opportunities."
"9510526","PROJECT ABSTRACT  ! Vector-borne diseases affect millions of people worldwide and are becoming an increasing threat as the effects of climate change become more significant. Due to the rise in global temperatures, the likelihood of vector borne diseases will increase in many areas as the range of insects, such as mosquitos, expands and changes. Wolbachia are maternally transmitted bacteria that infect nearly half of the insect species on the planet and block the replication and transmission of several human pathogens within insect vectors (so called ?pathogen blocking?). Wolbachia-infected mosquitos have been released in several parts of the world in order to control the transmission of Dengue virus. Importantly, the mechanism of pathogen blocking is not well understood. Unfortunately, our understanding of the Wolbachia-vector systems have been limited due to the lack of genetic tools in Wolbachia and the intractability of many important vectors. Our project is aimed at overcoming these obstacles by using the model system, Drosophila melanogaster, to identify mechanisms used by Wolbachia to manipulate host cell biology. The strength and innovation of this proposal derives from the topic of interest, the combined expertise of two PIs, and the application of novel approaches. We will build upon a fruitful collaboration to identify and characterize the type IV secretion substrates in Wolbachia. In our first aim, we define the Wolbachia type IV translocation signal(s) and effector interactions with the Wolbachia VirD4 coupling protein. In our second aim, we take a complementary in vivo approach, identifying direct interactions between Wolbachia VirD4 and effectors during infection. Additionally, we test the hypothesis that Wolbachia secrete DNA via this T4SS and begin studies in eukaryotic model systems aimed at characterizing the function of these proteins. Our results will define the effectors used by Wolbachia during infection, revealing mechanisms used by the bacterium to manipulate host cell biology, allowing for precise experimentation in non- model organisms, such as mosquito vectors."

"9478688","Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by the inherited loss of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and the leading monogenetic cause of autism. FMRP binds to many target mRNAs encoding proteins that play key roles at the synapse. FMRP has been shown to repress translation of many target mRNAs, and a few mechanisms have been proposed. FMRP interactions with microRNAs have been shown to play a role in translational control but the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. FMRP mediated repression of translation is reversibly regulated and dependent on the phosphorylation status of FMRP. FMRP has also been shown to be ubiquitinated in response to glutamate receptor stimulation, providing a potential mechanism to dynamically remove translational repression. It remains unclear whether any of the above mechanisms occur locally within dendrites to regulate local translation important for protein synthesis dependent synaptic plasticity. It is likely that some or all of these mechanisms are inter-related but critical details are lacking to understand FMRP mediated translational control and its reversibility in response to receptor signaling. A critical gap is lack of a unifying model for FMRP mediated repression and its reversible regulation at the synapse. We hypothesize that FMRP ubiquitination and UPS-mediated degradation in response to receptor stimulation provides a unifying mechanism to remove translational repression and regulate local protein synthesis at the synapse. The specific role of the E3 ligase Cdh1-APC in FMRP mediated regulation of local protein synthesis will be investigated. To elucidate the local functions of these mechanisms within dendrites and spines, we will continue to develop and apply fluorescent reporters and single molecule imaging of live cultured hippocampal neurons. Using dissociated and organotypic slice cultures as model systems, the role of UPS mediated FMRP degradation, as a local translational switch, to regulate spine morphology, synapse development and plasticity will be investigated. We will analyze the role of FMRP mutants that are resistant to ubiquitination or unable to bind Cdh1-APC to modulate or rescue FXS-associated impairments in dendritic spine development, synapse function and plasticity. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that FMRP dephosphorylation, ubiquitination by Cdh1-APC and UPS- mediated degradation are components of a dynamic molecular switch to regulate local mRNA translation that functions in control of dendritic spine morphology, synapse development and plasticity. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that FMRP ubiquitination and UPS-mediated degradation provides a mechanism to regulate targeting of RISC/microRNAs. This research is expected to uncover a novel role for Cdh1-APC and FMRP ubiquitination in regulation of microRNAs and local protein synthesis. The development of disease mechanism based therapeutic strategies for FXS will benefit from this in depth understanding of the mechanism and function of FMRP mediated control of local mRNA translation at synapses.  "
"9503726","Acid-base disturbances occur in a wide range of diseases, and lead to disturbances in arterial (a) and intracellular pH that can have devastating consequences for the patient. In response to such disturbances, the renal proximal tubule (PT)?which normally handles ~80% of the H+ secreted by the kidney?appropriately adjusts its rate of H+ secretion (JH). Previous work showed that the PT does not sense the pH on the basolateral (BL) side of the PT. Rather, PT JH markedly rises with increases in [CO2]BL or decreases in [HCO3?]BL. Nevertheless, mechanisms for sensing ?[CO2]BL and ?[HCO3?]BL and transducing these to ?JH are poorly understood. Important clues are that the basolateral CO2-evoked increase in JH requires that endogenously secreted ANG II bind to apical AT1A receptors, and is blocked by inhibitors that target a subset of receptor tyrosine kinases that include ErbB1 and ErbB2. New data show that the knockout (KO) of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase ? (RPTP?), normally present in the PT basal membrane, eliminates the ?JH produced by ?[CO2]BL and ?[HCO?]BL, and markedly reduces the ability of the whole mouse to regulate pHa during metabolic acidosis (MAc). Curiously, the extracel- lular side of RPTP? has a region?the carbonic-anhydrase?like domain (CALD)?that is ~40% identical to clas- sical carbonic anhydrases (CAs). The three aims of this proposal are a multidisciplinary approach to address, at three levels of integration, how PTs senses ?[CO2]BL and ?[HCO3?]BL and transduce them into ?JH, and the role played by these processes in pHa regulation of pHa during whole-body MAc and respiratory acidosis (RAc): At the molecular level, we ask (1) what is the mechanism of RPTP?? How do ?[CO2] and ?[ HCO3?] control RPTP??s dimerization, which controls its phosphatase activity? Does RPTP? interact with ErbB1 and ErbB2? And does the CALD lack of CA activity, and if so, why? At the cellular level we ask (2) how do RPTP? and putative down- stream elements function in isolated PTs? We will use viral constructs, injected into kidneys of RPTP? ?/? mice, to determine the roles of RPTP??s CALD and phosphatase domains. Are ErbB1 and ErbB2 required to transduce ?[CO2]BL and ?[ HCO3?]BL signals to ?JH? Do [CO2]BL and [HCO3?]BL control JH by modulating ability of luminal ANG II to signal at or downstream to apical AT1A? At the whole-animal level, we ask (3) are RPTP? and downstream effectors (ErbB1, ErbB2, ACE, and AT1A) essential in the whole-body responses to MAc and RAc? The approach, using KO mice, is to impose MAc or RAc and assess arterial blood gases, urine chemistry, and targeted transcription and protein profiles. Our work will produce major insights into how RPTP? senses and transduces changes in acid-base status, how downstream elements function in PTs, and the impact for the whole animal. Because RPTP? is expressed in a broad range of cell types, is closely related to RPTP? (mainly in CNS astro- cytes), and because RPTP??s CALD is similar to three orphaned CAs, the impact of our work will extend across a diverse range of organ systems and cell types. It will provide important insights clinical problems that include acid-base disturbances and to diseases linked to RPTP?, which include schizophrenia and cancer."
"9596046","Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea."
"9490716","Project Summary/Abstract Overall The overall goal of this Program Project Grant is to develop improved curative therapies for patients with hematological malignancies focusing primarily on adoptive cell therapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Because HCT often offers the best chance for cure, approximately 70,000 patients worldwide received transplants for hematological malignancies last year. Disease recurrence post HCT is the leading cause of treatment failure. T cells engineered by gene transfer to express a synthetic T cell receptor (TCR) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting a tumor-associated antigen have great potential as therapeutic agents, but there is much to learn about how to optimize effectiveness, eliminate toxicities and combine them with HCT. The objectives of this Program Project Grant are to develop effective T cell therapies for patients with the most common indication for allogeneic HCT, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and autologous HCT, multiple myeloma, and to define the type of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis that will best allow the use of adoptive T cell therapy post HCT. These objectives will be pursued in three interactive projects. Project 1 will explore the use of specific adoptive immunotherapy using high affinity WT1-specific TCR transduced T cells to treat patients with AML who have failed to achieve an initial complete response with conventional chemotherapy. In addition to determining the toxicity and efficacy of such treatment, this Project will test if cells derived from TN, TCM, of TEBV differ in their behavior, and will address features of TCR T cells and AML that lead to success or failure of treatment. Project 2 will evaluate the safety and efficacy of BCMA specific CAR T cells for treatment of patients with recurrent multiple myeloma. A direct comparison of CAR T cells containing two different co-stimulatory domains, CD28 versus 4-1BB, will be made to determine if they differ in efficacy or toxicity. Further experiments will explore methods to enhance the utility of BCMA CAR T cells including approaches to increase expression of BCMA on target cells or improve the function of CAR T cells by exposure to lenalidomide. In Project 3, two novel approaches to GVHD prophylaxis following peripheral blood HCT (TN cell depletion and post-HCT cyclophosphamide) will be compared to the current standard of care to determine which approach results in the highest percent of GVHD-free, relapse-free survival. Bone marrow and peripheral blood lymphocytes will be evaluated to determine immune reconstitution as well as factors that may best support subsequent adoptive immunotherapy. Success in the pursuit of the goals of this Program Project will provide powerful tools for treating AML and multiple myeloma, and should help define the best approach to GVHD prevention in the era of gene-modified T cells."
"9607177","The ability to reliably and chronically introduce electrical signals directly into the brain is crucial for a host of efforts to create neural prostheses as well as for basic research to understand brain function. Our goal is to further these efforts by developing a novel micro-coil based magnetic stimulation device suitable for implantation into cortex or into other regions of the CNS. Magnetic stimulation from micro-coils offers some important advantages over conventional electric stimulation. First, unlike the electric fields arising from implanted electrodes, the fields induced by coils are spatially asymmetric and can therefore be harnessed to create strong activating forces along a given orientation without creating strong activating forces in orthogonal directions. Thus, in the cortex for example, vertically-oriented pyramidal neurons can be strongly activated without simultaneously activating horizontally-oriented processes or the passing axons of distant neurons. Novel coil designs can be used to enhance selectivity even further and precisely control the volume of activation. A second important advantage of coils is that because magnetic fields pass readily through biological materials, the high impedance glial sheath that encapsulates cortical implants over time will not diminish the effectiveness of coils the way it can for electrodes. Finally, because there is no direct contact between the coil and neural tissue, electric current does not flow into the brain, making coils safer and less prone to many of the problems that occur at the interface between electrode and brain. Thus a coil-based prosthetic provides more precise activation of cortical targets than does electrodes and will remain stable over longer periods of time. The aims of this proposal are to further enhance the efficacy and selectivity of micro- coils by optimizing coil designs, developing stimulation strategies to effectively drive neuronal circuits, longitudinal testing to confirm performance metrics over time and finally, establishing efficacy in a nonhuman primate model."
"9479703","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Mutations that arise after fertilization in somatic cell lineages are linked to cancer and aging an have been shown to contribute to an increasing number of human disorders. Similarly, de novo germline mutations in neuronal genes are responsible for cases of autism, schizophrenia and intellectual disability, suggesting that similar types of somatic mutations could contribute to these and other neurological disorders by providing large-effect mutations in specific cell types, that may act alone or in concert with inherited variants. Despite the growing awareness of the importance of genomic mosaicism for human health, our present understanding of somatic mutation in different cellular lineages of the body and brain is minimal. This question has been difficult to address because conventional genome-wide methods cannot detect variants that are rare within a cell population, and most tissues are composed of diverse cell types and intermixed lineages. Single cell sequencing offers one solution, however, current methods suffer from high error-rates and low resolution, and do not allow for independent validation of mutations detected in merely one cell. A second means to amplify genomes from single cells is through clonal expansion. This is feasible for cancer and some self-renewing cell types, but not for many interesting or aged cell types such as post-mitotic neurons. Here, we propose to use two innovative strategies to profile genomes from individual neurons and control fibroblasts from young and aged mice. First, we take advantage of the only known method to amplify neuronal cells without use of oncogenic factors: cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer. This will enable deep whole genome sequencing and comprehensive mutational profiling of neuron-derived cell lines. Second, we will use nuclear transfer to produce pairs of sister cells derived from single neurons after one division. Single cell sequencing of replicate sister cells will enable sensitive and accurate detection of de novo copy number variation in a context where bona-fide mutations can be clearly distinguished from DNA amplification artifacts. Our application of these complementary technologies will reveal the full spectrum of genome variation that arises in different cell lineages during development and aging, and will help resolve longstanding hypotheses regarding the extent, impact and origins of neuronal genome diversity."

"9693940","OVERALL: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Berkeley Superfund Research Center, in consultation with the Program's key stakeholders, has identified four complex problems associated with hazardous waste sites that have proven intractable to current methods. These problems are how to better assess: 1) cumulative impacts from multiple environmental stressors (e.g. chemical exposures, stress and obesity); 2) past exposures, especially early-life exposures and their contribution to risk; 3) the effects of chemical mixtures and their impact on remediation efforts; and, 4) the complex transformation of chemicals to reactive intermediates and their ability to act through multiple mechanistic pathways. Here we propose six interactive projects (4 biomedical and 2 engineering) and 5 cores that aim to address these four problems though original research, translation to appropriate end-users and community engagement efforts. We will focus on exposures to high priority chemicals commonly found at Superfund sites, including arsenic, benzene, trichloroethene, formaldehyde, chromium and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to address the specific mandates of the Program. We will, however, take a novel approach in adopting the so-called `exposome paradigm' in our research. This new paradigm, which we helped develop, allows for a `seeing the whole picture' approach to risk assessment, hazard identification and the safe and effective remediation of hazardous sites containing multiple chemicals. In the exposome paradigm all non- genetic environmental stressors are considered as environmental exposures. Therefore, cumulative risk assessment, where the impact of all stressors on a population is assessed, could be operationalized by exposomics. Communities living near sites face cumulative risks from a variety of environmental and social factors. The theme of our Center is therefore the exposome and we propose a step-wise approach to applying exposomics to help solve the complex problems found at Superfund sites. Biomedical Projects 1-4 aim to develop advanced techniques for the detection, assessment, and evaluation of the effects and risk to human health of hazardous substances; Engineering Project 5 will develop methods to detect new hazardous substances in the environment and together with Engineering Project 6 will develop methods to reduce the amount and toxicity of hazardous substances. A Community Engagement Core C (CEC) will address contaminated drinking water problems in California in collaboration with Projects 1, 5 and 6 and Core E, a Data Science and Laboratory Core that will assist researchers and the CEC in meeting their goals. A Research Translation Core C will facilitate interactions between investigators and key stakeholders and a Training Core D will develop the next generation of multidisciplinary professionals. The overall goal is to enhance understanding of the relationship between exposure and disease; provide usable tools to improve human health risk assessments; and, develop a range of prevention and remediation strategies to protect public health and the environment. The program will be overseen and coordinated by an Administration Core A."
"9494420","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major technological and analytical advances in human brain imaging achieved as part of the Human Connectome Projects (HCP) enable examination of structural and functional brain connectivity at unprecedented levels of spatial and temporal resolution. This information is proving crucial to our understanding of normative variation in adult brain connectivity. It is now timely to use the tools and analytical approaches developed by the HCP to understand how structural and functional wiring of the brain develops. Using state-of-the art HCP imaging approaches will allow investigators to push our currently limited understanding of normative brain development to new levels. This knowledge will critically inform prevention and intervention efforts targeting well known public health concerns (e.g., neurological and psychiatric disorders, poverty). The majority of developmental connectivity studies to date have used fairly coarse resolution, have not been multi-modal in nature, and few studies have used comparable methods to assess individuals across a sufficiently wide age range to truly capture developmental processes (e.g., early childhood through adolescence). Here we propose a consortium of five sites (Harvard, Oxford, UCLA, University of Minnesota, Washington University), with extensive complimentary expertise in brain imaging and neural development, including many of the investigators from the adult and pilot lifespan HCP efforts. Our synergistic integration of advances from the HARVARD-MGH and WU-MINN-OXFORD HCPs with cutting edge expertise in child and adolescent brain development will enable major advances in our understanding of the normative development of human brain connectivity. The resultant unique resource will provide rich, multimodal data on several biological and cognitive constructs that are of critical importance to health and well-being across this age range and allow a wide range of investigators in the community to gain new insights about brain development and connectivity. Aim 1 will be to optimize existing HCP Lifespan Pilot project protocols on the widely available Prisma platform to respect practical constraints in studying healthy children and adolescents over a wide age range and will also collect a matched set of data on the original Skyra and proposed Prisma HCP protocols to serve as a linchpin between the past and present efforts. Aim 2 will be to collect 1500 high quality neuroimaging and associated behavioral datasets on healthy children and adolescents in the age range of 5-21, using matched protocols across sites, enabling robust characterization of age-related changes in network properties including connectivity, network integrity, response properties during tasks, and behavior. Aim 3 will be to collect and analyze longitudinal subsamples, task, and phenotypic measures that constitute intensive sub-studies of inflection points of health-relevant behavioral changes within specific developmental phases. Aim 4 will capitalize on our success in sharing data in the HCP, and use established tools, platforms and procedures to make all data publically available through the Connectome Coordinating Facility (CCF)."
"9693553","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) ages 16-29 are disproportionately affected by HIV, with high prevalence and incidence. While all other risk groups have declining rates of infection, dramatic increases are occurring among YMSM. YMSM are understudied, but preliminary research demonstrates that the HIV epidemic in YMSM forms a syndemic with drug use, violence, and mental health problems. The proposed study will build a dynamic dyadic-network cohort of 1,358 YMSM by hybridizing 2 existing cohorts of YMSM: Project Q2 (aged 20-24) and ChiGuys (aged 16-17). We will expand this unified cohort through the enrollment of serious sexual partners of core participants, thereby creating a dynamic dyadic network. The overarching goal of this proposal is to apply a next generation multilevel model (Network-Individual-Resources model) to understand the syndemic among a cohort of YMSM and inform high-impact HIV prevention with this vulnerable population. To achieve this goal, we propose four specific aims. Aim 1 is to understand how syndemics of substance use, HIV, STIs, mental disorders, and violence develop among YMSM using an accelerated longitudinal design. We will assess youth every 6 months during the transition from late adolescence to early adulthood, to describe the trajectories of syndemic development (including substance use) and use innovative statistical modeling to characterize different trajectories of syndemic development to predict youth most at risk of HIV acquisition. Aim 2 is to determine how dyadic processes influence HIV risk behaviors and transmission among YMSM by enrolling their serious sexual partners into the cohort. We will utilize dyadic data to identify which sexual partner and relationship factors are longitudinally related to unprotected sex and HIV/STI transmission across development. Phylogenetic analyses will link HIV transmissions within dyads to determine what behavioral, partner and dyadic factors predict such transmission. Aim 3 is to describe network and structural influences on syndemic development among YMSM. We will examine how sexual and drug use network structure Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the largest HIV transmission group in the U.S. and infections are increasing most among young MSM (YMSM). The objective of this proposal is to build a large and innovative dynamic dyadic-network cohort of YMSM and their serious sexual partners in order to delineate multilevel influences on HIV and substance use. This cohort will serve as a strong resource platform for a wide range of future innovative research efforts and will inform behavioral and biomedical HIV prevention interventions for YMSM."
"9458142","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Saliva is an integral component of oral physiology and critical for the maintenance of oral health. Impaired production and/or secretion of saliva can have a significant impact on speech, taste and swallowing and lead to increased risk of dental caries and oral infection. In patients with head and neck cancer, salivary gland dysfunction is one of the common complications of radiation therapy (RT). Xerostomia (severe dry mouth) is a debilitating side-effect of RT that adversely affects quality of life in these patients. Clinical evaluation of xerostomia involves patient-based or physician-based grading systems that are subjective and prone to error and variability. Conventional sialographic and scintigraphic methods allow for objective evaluation of salivary gland dysfunction but are either invasive or require the use of radioisotopes and are therefore not ideal for longitudinal assessment in patients. Development of a cheap, reliable, and easy to use non-invasive imaging method for salivary gland imaging could therefore be of immense clinical benefit. In this application, we propose to utilize photoacoustic imaging (PAI), a relatively new imaging technique that allows for non-invasive assessment of salivary gland structure and function. Given the relationship between blood flow and saliva production, we hypothesize that PAI-based hemodynamic assessment can serve as a reliable read-out of salivary gland function in vivo. In support of this hypothesis, preliminary studies conducted in our laboratory have shown that PAI can detect changes in salivary gland hemodynamics following gustatory stimulation in vivo. Changes in PAI-based measures of oxygen saturation showed good correlation with power Doppler sonography measures of vascularity. Vascular response to gustatory stimulation was significantly reduced 24 hours following RT suggestive of early radiation-induced vascular injury of salivary glands. Building on these preliminary observations, this application will test the central hypothesis that PAI can be used for non-invasive assessment of salivary gland function and radiation-induced salivary gland injury in vivo. We propose to examine the potential of PAI for salivary gland imaging in small (Aim 1) and large animal (Aim 2) models, conduct a pilot study (Aim 3) in healthy human volunteers and head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment."

Under NIH P41 funding, we designed and built the world's first soft x-ray microscope for biological imaging, and pioneered soft x-ray tomography as a mainstream technique for visualizing and quantifying sub-cellular organization. We also developed the world's first high numerical- aperture cryogenic light microscope for localizing fluorescently tagged molecules in cells, and then equipped the CLM with a specimen rotation stage to enable cryogenic fluorescence tomography, a completely new imaging modality for localizing labeled molecules inside a cell. More recently, we capitalized on the highly complementary characteristics of CFT and SXT by pairing them in correlative imaging studies. In overall component we describe our progress to date, and highlight the application of these new imaging technologies in biomedical research."
"9426859","ABSTRACT This application focuses on pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a prototype of heritable ectopic mineralization disorders. PXE is caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene which encodes ABCC6, an efflux transporter expressed primarily in the liver. Characteristic clinical manifestations include cutaneous findings which signify the potential for development of ocular complications leading to loss of visual acuity and blindness, as well as cardiovascular involvement, including nephrogenic hypertension, intermittent claudication, bleeding from gastrointestinal arteries, early myocardial infarct and stroke. There is no specific or effective treatment for PXE or related ectopic mineralization disorders. Significant recent progress has been made in understanding the pathomechanistic details resulting in ectopic mineralization in PXE, and this information has now provided a platform to develop novel treatments. A particularly intriguing recent observation made by us is that release of ATP from hepatocytes to the circulation is dependent on functional ABCC6, and in the absence of ABCC6 activity, as in PXE, the plasma PPi levels are markedly reduced. Since PPi is a powerful anti-mineralization factor, reduced plasma PPi levels and particularly reduced PPi/Pi ratio allow ectopic mineralization in the peripheral tissues to ensue. In this study, we will test the unifying hypothesis that restoration of plasma PPi levels in patients with PXE will counteract the clinical manifestations of this devastating disease. To enhance plasma PPi levels, we have developed three Specific Aims proposing (a) pharmacologically enhanced release of cellular ATP either in an ABCC6-dependent or ABCC6-independent manner; (b) inhibition of tissue non- specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), the enzyme responsible for degradation of plasma PPi to Pi; and (c) oral administration of PPi with subsequent increases in plasma PPi levels. These plans are based on solid preliminary data, and they take advantage of well-characterized mouse and rat models developed and characterized in our laboratory, recapitulating clinical, histopathologic, ultrastructural and genetic features of PXE. Our plans also include a Phase I Clinical Trial to demonstrate the absorption of orally administered PPi in human volunteers and in patients with PXE with assay of pharmacokinetics in plasma.  Collectively, our state-of-the-art studies utilizing in vivo model systems for PXE are expected to provide critical preclinical information of potential efficacy to restore plasma PPi levels in PXE, with subsequent inhibition of ectopic mineralization. Such information is reasonably expected to be useful towards development of pharmacologic treatments for PXE, as well as for other ectopic mineralization disorders, for which no effective or specific therapy is currently available."

"9513756","Project Summary Peripheral nerves serve as a bidirectional link between the central nervous system (CNS) and its distal targets. The autonomic nervous system (ANS), which is part of the peripheral nervous system, innervates internal organs to modulate their function and transmits sensory information back to the CNS. By selectively stimulating the ANS nerves, neuromodulation of target organs can be achieved. Numerous therapeutic applications of neuromodulation are currently under investigation to relieve diseases and conditions. In-depth knowledge of neuroanatomy and real-time information on nerve health during surgical or neuromodulation procedures are essential for successful outcomes. The current method for mapping neuroanatomy and evaluating nerve injury is end-point histology, which is limited by difficulty in obtaining temporal biological responses absent subject variability, processing artifacts, and the lag between overstimulation and injury manifestation. Thus, it is imperative to develop real-time quantitative imaging tools to assess nerve structure and function. The goal of this project is to develop optical coherence tomography (OCT) based peripheral nerve imaging technology to study the structure and function of somatic and autonomic nerves. We will use specific advantages of OCT, particularly the ability to derive intrinsic contrast measures and its depth sectioning capability, to validate novel tools for mapping peripheral nerve anatomy and define new imaging biomarkers of neuromodulation and nerve injury. We will deploy OCT systems to SPARC investigators to expand the potential nerve applications that benefit from our tools. A successful effort will transform the manner in which neuromodulation devices are assessed and deployed, leading to more effective therapies and better patient outcomes."
"9476370","Zika virus infection during pregnancy causes brain abnormality in newborns, most remarkably small heads (microcephaly). Microcephaly is usually caused by defects in the development of the brain cortex. The brain cortex develops from the division, proliferation and differentiation of neuron precursors (neuroprogenitors). It is known that Zika virus can cause the depletion of neuroprogenitors and cell death, however, little is known about how this happens. Cholesterol is a fundamental lipid component that is essential for mammalian cell function and proliferation. Defects of cholesterol biosynthesis also causes microcephaly. Interestingly, host innate immune response to viral infection lead to production of interferons. While interferon can control viral infection, it also severely inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis. We propose that it was the innate anti-viral interferon response that causes a collateral damage to the developing brain during Zika virus infection. We plan to use animal models as well as stem cell technology to test our hypothesis. Our study may lead to new strategies to prevent microcephaly and other brain abnormalities associated with maternal Zika virus infection."
"9482712","7. Project Summary/Abstract The purpose of this K01 proposal is to provide Dr. Jinnie Rhee with the protected time and resources to allow her to pursue the training needed to reach her long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator in patient-centered clinical research, and an expert in diabetes epidemiology. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains a challenge due to the complexity of multiple medication regimens that are often needed, and the required pharmacological dose adjustments and contraindications of several conventional antidiabetic medications. Barriers to achieving optimal T2DM management in CKD may include low patient adherence, and conservative provider prescription decision- making, resulting from lack of long-term data on the safety and effectiveness regarding benefits and harms of certain medication classes over others in patients with CKD, particularly for newer medications with which there has been little clinical experience in the CKD population. The objective of the proposed research is to better understand the comparative safety and effectiveness of various strategies aimed to manage T2DM in CKD, and to understand factors that currently influence patient and provider choice of these strategies through a series of quantitative and qualitative studies. In Aim 1, Dr. Rhee will conduct a descriptive study to quantify patterns of conventional and newer antidiabetic medication use across different stages of CKD, and examine proportions of each medication prescribed by an endocrinologist, nephrologist, or primary care physician. In Aim 2, Dr. Rhee will use a detailed administrative database to compare the safety and effectiveness of DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists versus conventional antidiabetic medications by examining associations with cardiovascular outcomes, glycemic control, weight gain, and hypoglycemia-related ED visits and hospitalizations. Effect modification by CKD stage will also be examined. In Aim 3, Dr. Rhee will conduct a qualitative study to understand: (1) the perspectives of patients on the use of antidiabetic drugs, including newer agents, and uncover perceived barriers to, and facilitators of, adherence; and (2) providers? perspectives on prescribing conventional and newer antidiabetic medications, and examine both clinical and nonclinical factors that influence their prescription decision-making. This award will allow Dr. Rhee to transition into a clinically-minded epidemiologist whose work goes beyond quantitative research. It will help her fill critical training gaps in the areas of advanced pharmacoepidemiology, health services research, and qualitative research. The detailed training plan includes formal coursework at Stanford University as well as seminars, meetings, research apprenticeships, directed readings, and attendance at national/international conferences. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant public health and clinical impact. The sum of experiences acquired through this K01 will help Dr. Rhee to successfully transition toward an independent clinical research career."
"9478024","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Menisci play an important mechanical role in the knee, including load transmission, energy dissipation, joint congruity and stability. It is now widely recognized that loss of meniscal integrity is an important contributor to the development of degenerative changes and osteoarthrosis. This has lead to an emphasis on preservation of meniscal tissue in the setting of meniscal repair as well as augmentation techniques used to facilitate meniscal healing. Clinical evaluation and post-operative management in the setting of meniscal repair is clearly challenging and variable from patient to patient. This application proposes to perform a study that will implement novel MR pulse sequences (ultrashort time to echo (UTE) techniques) that are able to acquire signal intensity from meniscal tissue, not possible on standard clinical MR sequences. In so doing, in our first aim, we will compare the accuracy of novel and conventional MR pulse sequences for characterizing tissue structure using a histopathologic reference standard. Our hypothesis is that novel ultrashort time to echo (UTE) sequences will be more accurate in evaluating meniscal structure. Quantitative MR techniques have been introduced in the literature over the past several years that are reported to reflect the biochemical content of tissue. These include, among others, T2 mapping (reflection of collagen) and T1 rho mapping (reflection of proteoglycan). In our second aim, we propose to compare the relationship between standard clinical quantitative T2 and T1 rho techniques with those performed with the UTE technique, using biochemical, biomechanical and histopathologic reference standards. Our hypothesis is that MR sequences that can acquire signal from meniscal tissue (UTE technique) will correlate more strongly with changes in collagen and proteoglycan integrity. In our third aim, we will apply the aforementioned techniques in an in vitro human meniscal and in vivo ovine model of meniscal repair implementing histolopathologic and biomechanical reference standards. Our hypothesis is that quantitative MR sequences will allow non-invasive tissue characterization of the healing response (both structural and biomechanical) in the setting of meniscal repair. In our final aim, we will translate the novel MR pulse sequences to a cohort of patients that have undergone primary meniscal repair with interrogation at 1, 3 and 4 months post-meniscal repair. We will also get a pre- MRI prior to the surgical procedure. We will use a clinical assessment tool as a reference standard. Our hypothesis is that quantitative MR sequences can successfully be translated to the clinical setting where they can monitor tissue response in the setting of meniscal repair."
"9584348","Tuberculosis kills over 1.5 million people each year and the emergence of multiple and extensively drug resistant strains demands new approaches for the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of TB. Numerous aspects of mycobacterial physiology remain poorly understood, and the study of bacteriophages and the interactions between the mycobacteria and their phages presents uncommon opportunities to understand the mycobacteria. One unanticipated finding is that many of the mycobacteriophages are temperate, and form stable lysogens in which the phage DNA is stably integrated into the mycobacterial chromosome as a prophage. Far from being inert, these prophages express genes that play key roles role in providing defense from attack by other unrelated bacteriophages. The variety of systems is considerable, and although some are canonical mechanisms, such as restriction-modification (R-M) and membrane- mediated exclusion, most are conferred by genes of unknown function and lack bioinformatic motifs indicative of extant viral defense systems. Nonetheless, there is evidence that some of these systems function by interrupting normal mycobacterial growth, leading to growth arrest in a persistent-like state that deprives the phage of a home for productive replication. In addition to providing insights into mycobacterial physiology, viral defense systems can be powerful biotechnological drivers, with CRISPR-Cas and R-M systems being powerful examples. A newly identified prophage-encoded viral defense system is encoded by phage Sbash, which reduces infection by the unrelated phage Crossroads ? but not other phages ? by more than five orders of magnitude. Two Sbash genes are responsible for the defense, but their functions are unknown and it is not known how they confer defense or how they target Crossroads. Unusually, Crossroads escape from defense occurs by both heritable and non-heritable mechanisms. Understanding the mechanism of defense and the basis of the specificity will reveal insights into mycobacterial physiology and has the potential for biotechnological development."
"9462048","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating genetic muscle disorder. Augmenting the regeneration potential of endogenous muscle progenitor cells is one of the potential approaches to attenuate disease progression in DMD. Moreover, introduction of exogenous muscle stem cells can be used as an approach to restore dystrophin levels in DMD patients. However, transplantation of muscle stem cells into dystrophic muscles typically results in minimal engraftment which is attributed, at least in part, o the poor fusion of the introduced myogenic cells with injured myofibers. While the mechanisms of myoblast fusion remain less understood, enhancing fusion of endogenous or introduced myogenic cells has enormous potential for the development of novel cellular therapies for DMD patients. Ongoing studies in my laboratory have identified myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (Myd88), as a major positive regulator of myoblast fusion. Our preliminary studies have shown that levels of Myd88 are increased during muscle regeneration and upon induction of differentiation in cultured myoblasts. Genetic deletion of Myd88 specifically inhibits myoblast fusion without affecting their proliferation and differentiation. While our preliminary studies clearly demonstrate that Myd88-mediated signaling promotes myoblast fusion, it remains unknown whether augmenting the levels of Myd88 in myoblasts can stimulate myofiber regeneration and improve engraftment of introduced myoblasts in DMD. In this project, we have proposed to investigate the effects of myoblast-specific ablation and overexpression of Myd88 on disease progression in a preclinical mouse model of DMD. Our hypothesis and specific aims are: AIM I: Investigate the effects of myoblast-specific deletion of Myd88 in myopathy of mdx mice. Hypothesis I: Myoblast-specific deletion of Myd88 will inhibit repair of injured myofibers and exaggerate myopathy in mdx mice. AIM II: Investigate the effects of myoblast-specific overexpression of Myd88 in the pathogenesis of mdx mice. Hypothesis IIa: Overexpression of Myd88 in exogenous myoblasts (before transplantation) will improve their engraftment in dystrophic muscle of mdx mice; and Hypothesis IIb: Myoblast-specific transgenic overexpression of Myd88 will enhance myofiber regeneration and mitigate myopathy in mdx mice. Successful completion of this work will provide basis for considering Myd88 as therapeutic target in preclinical trials for patients with DMD. Furthermore, the project will provide me outstanding new training to achieve my goal of becoming a tenure-track faculty in an academic institution."
"9676478","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammation is generally required for the development of insulin resistance in obese animals, consistent with demonstrations that inflammation predisposes obese people to be metabolically unhealthy. In contrast, obese people with negligible inflammation are often metabolically healthy. The role of inflammation as an accelerator of obesity-associated metabolic decline indicates that an inflammatory signature can predict the transition from obese/metabolically healthy to obese/insulin resistant/type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our proposed work will comprehensively define inflammatory signature(s) during T2D etiology and pathogenesis to fill critical gaps in 1. Identifying people most likely to transition to T2D in response to obesity; 2. Pinpointing treatments to new targets thus improve the currently modest efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs in T2D; and 3. Using targeted therapies to uncouple obesity from inflammatory-mediated complications such as T2D and cardiovascular disease. We have used a multivariate mathematical approach to identify a previously unappreciated inflammatory signature that differentiates obese/non-T2D, obese/pre-T2D and obese/T2D subjects. This signature includes multiple T cell cytokines, many of which are preferentially produced by the Th17 or Th1 T cell subsets. Our identification of a human T cell inflammatory signature coupled with the proposed extention of the analyses to additional putative sources of diabetogenic inflammation provide unique opportunities to address important outstanding questions in the relationship between inflammation and T2D pathogenesis. We will test the hypothesis that a T cell signature that distinguishes T2D from non-T2D subjects is a predictive biomarker for T2D pathogenesis through a longitudinal multiple-PI project involving experts in human immunometabolism, cytokine network modeling and clinical research in obesity. The possibility that a cytokine signature validated by the proposed work will identify people who require more intensive monitoring, intervention or new anti-inflammatory drugs to delay or prevent obesity-associated T2D has tremendous potential to change clinical practice, emphasizing both the impact and the urgency of the project."
"9454493","The QBAR Core builds on four recently established laboratories within the College of Health Professions that provide state-of-the-art measurements of behavioral function (e.g., 3-D kinematics, kinetics and electromyography) and rehabilitation interventions (locomotor, constraint-induced movement and intensive task-oriented upper extremity training) in hemiparesis post-stroke patients. At present, the measurement and intervention framework available to clinicians is theoretically and practically insufficient to determine relevant deficits of a post-stroke patient and prescribe efficacious interventions. Rehabilitation needs to be moved much closer to a model where: (a) the health of a person's motor control system would be assayed, (b) specific deficits would be identified, (c) specific treatments would be used to target the deficits, and (d) quantitative measures would provide assessment of the pre- and post-treatment states. The QBAR Core will support investigators in their development of measurement and intervention frameworks by means of two primary roles: (1) The Quantitative Behavioral Assessment role enables SCRCRS investigators to study how measures of brain plasticity and behavior can be used to guide and individualize rehabilitation and/or restorative therapies. Core services include motion capture and electromyography for precise measures of motion and muscle activity, energetics as measured by oxygen consumption, accelerometer-based devices for measuring activities such as walking and hemiparetic arm use, neuromuscular measures of strength and power of individual joints, clinical measures, and animal behavioral assay equipment. (2) The Rehabilitation role enables SCRCRS investigators to study the experience-dependent nature of post-stroke plasticity by providing standardized experience to optimize the treatment effects of restorative therapies, either by using current state-of-the-art methods or developing novel tools or methods.

"9487773","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to launch a Training and Research Program on HIV and TB in India at the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt-India-HTRTP). This new Pitt-India-HTRTP program will operate in collaboration with our partners at LEPRA Society (LepS), Hyderabad, India, one of the major research and clinical centers working on HIV and TB. Over the last couple of years, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh have been working with the investigators at LepS in conducting community based prevention studies and developing novel rapid diagnosis of TB. LepS is a 90-year old non-governmental organization providing healthcare services to rural populations of India inflicted with TB, Leprosy, HIV and Malaria. Recently, LepS started a research center to complement its clinical activities, but there is still an acute shortage of scholars and physicians with knowledge in modern research (laboratory, clinical, and behavioral sciences) to meet the ever-growing public health challenges of preventing and controlling drug resistant and normal TB in HIV infected populations. Based on comprehensive needs assessment by LepS management in conjunction with the ongoing research programs at the University of Pittsburgh, we identified multiple areas in which LepS workers can be trained to further their research capacity. Goal of the Pitt-India-HTRTP is to enhance the research capacity of LepS by training health care professionals in multidisciplinary cutting-edge research, publish pioneering research as well as participate in clinical trials to improve control of HIV and TB in India. The proposed training program will be led by Dr. Phalguni Gupta, Professor, Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology (IDM) and Co- Directors, Drs. Velpandi Ayyavoo, Professor of IDM with expertise in HIV, Anil Ojha, Assistant Professor of IDM with expertise in TB, and Todd Reinhart, Professor of IDM with expertise in HIV immunology. In addition, a joint Training Advisory Committee from the University of Pittsburgh, LepS, and the Government-affiliated research and health-policy institutions in India will provide ongoing critical evaluations of the program structure, recruitment, research plans, and placement. While most of the long-term training (leading to degrees) and short-term training will be at the University of Pittsburgh, some short-term training in clinical and basic sciences wil be provided through our partners at the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT), and Center for DNA fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) in India for only those trainees who cannot travel to the US. The proposed Program offers a unique opportunity for the coordinated, interdisciplinary training of health professionals from India in HIV/TB research in epidemiology, behavioral sciences, and laboratory sciences. Through this Pitt-India-HTRTP training program, health care professionals at LepS will gain knowledge about innovative research in HIV, TB and HIV/TB co-infections, and conduct clinical trials in these areas, sensitive diagnosis, and optimum treatment modalities against these infections. These enhancements will enable LepS to make informed policy decision on implementing effective control programs against HIV and TB."
"9471351","Symptomatic meniscal tear with knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common, disabling and costly problem. Recent trials have shown that physical therapy (PT) -- including therapist-supervised exercises, manual therapy and a home exercise program -- leads to similar levels of pain relief as surgical management in patients with symptomatic meniscal tear and OA. As a result, referral for PT is recommended as the treatment of choice for these patients. However, a PT regimen has never been compared with placebo or simple prescription of home exercise in this population. Therefore, several important questions remain unanswered: How much of the pain relief associated with PT-based regimens can be attributed to physiologic effects vs. attention placebo effects? Is therapist-directed exercise coupled with a home exercise program any more efficacious than a home exercise program alone? Can the efficacy of the home program be optimized by employing innovative methods to maximize exercise adherence? These questions led us to propose the TeMPO (Treatment of Meniscal Problems in Osteoarthritis) Trial. The long term objective of this research is to define the most effective and cost effective nonoperative regimen for managing symptomatic meniscal tear with OA. The specific aims are: Aim 1: To conduct a multicenter, parallel, four-arm RCT in subjects ?40 years old with symptomatic meniscal tear and radiographic or pre-radiographic OA to establish the efficacy of components of the typical PT regimen. The four arms include:  Arm 1: Prescription of an information-based (pamphlet, DVD) home exercise program  Arm 2: The information-based home exercise program with adherence optimization  Arm 3: Same as Arm 2 plus a clinic-based, therapist-directed sham PT intervention  Arm 4: Same as Arm 2 plus clinic-based, therapist-directed exercise and manual therapy The primary outcome is change in pain from baseline to 3 months. Subjects will be followed for 12 months. Aim 2: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a home exercise regimen with adherence optimization and a therapist-directed exercise and manual therapy program coupled with an optimized home exercise regimen. The results of the proposed trial and cost-effectiveness analysis will help clinicians, patients and policymakers make evidence-based decisions about management of symptomatic meniscal tear in the presence of OA, one of the most frequent musculoskeletal conditions seen in general practice. "
"9483794","Summary  Glial activation and production of proinflammatory mediators contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. Pre-clinical studies implicate microglia, the macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), as critical early regulators in the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain. However, other studies indicate that microglial activation and the production of various proinflammatory factors play a beneficial role in nerve regeneration and functional recovery following nerve injury. Moreover, our preliminary studies show that similar to peripheral macrophages, spinal cord microglia exhibit a proinflammatory phenotype at early time points and an anti-inflammatory phenotype at later time points following spinal nerve L5 transection (L5Tx, a well-established murine model of neuropathic pain). We propose that these two microglial activation states correspond to unique sets of microglial functions. By optimally regulating microglial activation rather than completely inhibiting the activation of microglia, we can potentially limit the contribution of microglia to the development of neuropathic pain while simultaneously preserving the beneficial properties of microglia in nerve regeneration. We believe that CD137 ligand (CD137L) expressed on microglial surface acts in a proinflammatory manner and that negatively modulating CD137L can potentially shift the pro- vs. anti-inflammatory balance in activated microglia towards an anti- inflammatory state. However, most of the known functions of CD137L have been obtained from studies on peripheral immune cells. The role of CD137L in CNS microglia has not been studied extensively and the role of microglial CD137L in the development of neuropathic pain is unknown. In this study, we will determine the role of microglial CD137L in the pathophysiology of peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain through the examination of two murine models of neuropathic pain. We hypothesize that microglial CD137L is involved in the development of peripheral nerve injury -induced pain-like behaviors and that negatively modulating CD137L can promote a shift in microglial activation towards an anti- inflammatory state and thus reduce peripheral nerve injury-induced pain-like behaviors. This central hypothesis will be tested via three specific aims: 1) Characterize the involvement of CD137L in peripheral nerve injury-induced pain-like behaviors. Pain-like behaviors will be tested in mice with and without CD137L expression. 2) Evaluate the activation status of spinal cord microglia following peripheral nerve injury in relation to the expression of microglial CD137L. Microglial activation will be monitored through assessing microglial phenotype via flow cytometry. And 3) determine the involvement of CD137-dependent vs. CD137- independent pathways in peripheral nerve injury-induced, CD137L-mediated pain-like behaviors and microglial responses. In sum, we believe that the investigation of CD137L could lead to novel treatment that could significantly reduce neuropathic pain while has minimal adverse impact on nerve recovery."
"9481719","Clinical Core Abstract The human core developed through the first 4 years has become an established center for translational research in pulmonary hypertension (PH), encompassing a large biorepository and clinical trials coordinating center. The goal of the human core during this renewal is to support all Research Projects by 1) providing the infrastructure and expertise necessary to conduct clinical trials of new therapies of dietary supplements for Group I and Group II PH, and 2) collecting hemodynamic, clinical, biomarker, and microbiome data on PH patients for robust phenotyping. Specific expansions of the human core for this renewal include enrollment of Groups I-V PH patients into the human subphenotyping core registry to provide mechanistic insight into endo- phenotypes of PH including the role of the microbiome in PH, collection of pulmonary artery endothelial cells during clinical right heart catheterization, as well as harvest of isolated endothelial, smooth muscle and lung fibroblasts from human lungs of PH patients removed at time of transplantation. The core will draw on the extensive clinical and research infrastructure harnessed during the first phase of the TPPG including 14 clinics, over 1,000 clinical right heart catheterization each year, 34 ongoing NIH- or industry-funded research projects, over 2,500 biospecimens banked, a vascular clinical translational research center specializing in assessment of endothelial function for 9 NIH- or industry-funded research projects, and over 1,200 patients enrolled in clinical trials over the past five years. The human core is critical to all Projects to fulfill the translational directive of the TPPG, in which each Project will conduct a clinical or translational trial. This unmatched resource will accelerate the pace of discovery in the Projects by rapidly identifying appropriate patients for clinical trials and by providing a wealth of biospecimens with corresponding clinical data for mechanistic investigations."
"9415091","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a revised competing renewal for a second funding period to support the development and evaluation of fluorescence imaging (FI) in guiding the resection of intracranial tumor. Utilizing quantitative FI (qFI) concepts developed during the first funding period, and realized in the form of an intraoperative probe, concentrations of d-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) have been measured quantitatively in vivo in human brain tumors. These results are clinically profound because they indicate for the first time that diagnostically significant PpIX concentrations exist  brain tumors which are below the threshold of human visual detection - even in low grade glioma (LGG) - tumors previously found inaccessible with visual FI (vFI), despite the significant clinical impact to be gained from improving their completeness of surgical resection through FI technique. Our overall research plan for continuation outlines clinical and technical/ preclinical studies that will be pursued in parallel - a strategy that has proved to be successful during the current funding period and creates a framework for iterative exchange that informs the clinical and technical requirements for solving the resection challenges facing the surgeon. In the second funding phase of the project, we implement and evaluate preclinically technical advances (in Aim 1) designed to achieve wide-field quantitative FI (qFI) and wide-field depth-detected FI (dFI). We will also enroll patients into clinical studies of ALA-induced PpIX FI (in Ai 2) to generate the data required to determine the probability of tumor for a given quantitative value of PpIX concentration. These studies will set the stage for prospective clinical enrollments (in Aim 3) designed to evaluate the addition of qFI and dFI to visual fluorescence imaging (vFI) when surgical accuracy is evaluated intra- and post-operatively with conventional methods . We will realize the combination of qFI and dFI (in Aim 4) to quantitatively detect PpIX concentration at depth by incorporating spatial light modulation imaging in fluorescence as well as reflectance modes. These techniques will also be extended to emerging fluorophores with excitation/emission spectra covering near-infrared wavelengths, which may ultimately have more potential than PpIX, and to enable simultaneous quantitative imaging of concentrations of multiple fluorophores. By the end of the proposed funding period, we will have implemented and evaluated wide-field qFI and dFI techniques in human surgeries and expect to demonstrate that these innovations improve surgical outcomes when added to vFI in a prospective enrollment of patients with malignant glioma."
"9467620","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains the most deadly form of brain cancer. There is a dire need to better define the molecular pathways that regulate the malignant features of GBM, in particular, its invasiveness and the persistence of glioma stem cells (GSC), also known as tumor propagating cells, which are thought to be the main source of tumor recurrence due to their tumorigenic potential and therapy resistance. Plexin-B2 is an axon guidance receptor originally identified as a gene highly upregulated in glioma. Our recent patient database analyses found that upregulation of Plexin-B2 correlates with glioma grade and poor survival. This prompted us to investigate the mechanistic basis of this important link. Our studies in human ATCC glioma cell lines demonstrated that Plexin-B2 activation alters actin cytoskeleton and promotes cell migration through activation of Rho GTPases. In intracranial transplants, Plexin-B2 shRNA knockdown hindered invasion and disrupted glioma vascularization. Our new preliminary data from patient-derived GSC lines suggest that besides a promigratory role, Plexin-B2 may also regulate glioma stem cell phenotypes, including stem cell marker expression, self-renewal capacity, proliferation and differentiation potential. Building on these exciting results, we propose to test the central hypothesis that Plexin-B2 plays a multifaceted role in promoting glioma invasion and stem cell characteristics. To facilitate our studies, we have adopted CRISPR gene editing technology to generate bi-allelic mutations of Plexin-B2 in patient-derived GSC lines. In Aim 1, we focus on glioma invasion and ask if Plexin-B2 signaling influences cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular motility of GBM cells by performing culture assays, brain slice cultures, and intracranial transplants. By comparing cell migration of GSCs and their differentiated progeny, this set of studies also addresses whether migratory potential is contingent on differentiation hierarchy. In Aim 2, we focus on glioma stem cell characteristics and ask if Plexin-B2 contributes to stem cell marker expression, self-renewal capacity, proliferation and differentiation potential, and treatment resistance. We will investigate in survival cohorts with GSC intracranial transplants if Plexin-B2 deletion confers survival benefit and if it reduces radiation resistance. In Aim 3, we focus on functional targets and downstream effectors of Plexin-B2 signaling in mediating migration and stem cell properties. We ask which intracellular domain of Plexin-B2 is the main signaling arm, if cellular migration is mediated through modulation of Rho GTPases, whether STAT3 functions as a core signaling hub, and if stem cell factors SOX2 or OLIG2 function downstream of STAT3 for stemness maintenance. Lastly, we will study the adhesion molecules L1CAM and cadherins/protocadherins, the most significantly regulated group of genes that were identified in our recent RNA-Seq analysis of Plexin-B2 knockout GSC. Understanding how Plexin-B2 regulates the malignant features of GBM will open up possibilities for new targets to inhibit glioma growth and invasion."
"9601530","High Precision Biochips of Membrane Mimics for Blood Biomarker Assessment  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated, inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. There has been tremendous effort in searching of biomarkers that are capable of distinguishing between MS disease and control, detecting inflammatory activity and the degree of neurodegeneration and demyelination/ remyelination. Despite a list of candidate biomarkers, most of them have not been validated, and therefore they are not clinically useful. Additionally, many of these marker candidates are from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which are difficult to evaluate routinely. Blood-based biomarkers, on the other hand, are of great value because of the ease in blood collection by a minimally invasive manner. However, evaluation of marker candidates in blood has met considerable difficulty due to issues of low abundance, complex background, and lack of technical capability to carry out effective screening.  This proposal aims to develop a set of biochips with precise display of lipid antigens in the form of air-stable, robust membrane mimics arrays. These biochips will be combined with surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) technique for assessment of biomarker detection in blood in a high throughput fashion. We will employ lithography and 3D printing technology to fabricate both the chip substrate and flow cells that enable better control of solution delivery, eliminate alignment steps and avoid index matching fluid, substantially simplifying the experimental procedure in SPRi measurement. SPRi is an attractive label-free technique for microarray analysis, offering high detection sensitivity without the need of a label, and enables various measurement functions to be carried out with simple instrument configuration. Specific aims for this work include 1) fabrication of high performance array of membrane mimics for SPRi with photolithographic methods. A ganglioside array will be constructed with natural and synthetic lipid hosting environment for studies to understand how molecular display of antigens affects binding and marker screening in blood samples; 2) fabrication of highly integrated arrays of membrane mimics with 3D printing technology. We will characterize the performance of ganglioside arrays in detection of antibodies in blood and test a 3D printed flow system that can be assembled into biochips to form a cartridge-like unit; 3) assessment of analytical performance of the high precision biochips for detection of MS biomarkers in blood. The focus is to construct high quality arrays consisting of known and potential lipid antigens and carry out performance characterization in terms of sensitivity, working range and cross activity. We will also run clinical samples of MS patients from commercial sources to evaluate the effectiveness of this platform for biomarker screening as compared to lipid overlay array method."
"9362601","ABSTRACT    Basic investigations postulate that an imbalance between neurotransmitters regulating the stress (corticotropin releasing factor, CRF, norepinephrine, orexin, vasopressin and dynorphin) and anti-stress systems (nociceptin and neuropeptide Y, NPY) underlie negative reinforcement and relapse in addiction. NPY is one such neuropeptide transmitter that exerts anti-stress effects in the brain. Basic investigations support a role for increased NPY transmission in counteracting an overactive CRF system to block anxiety and stress- induced relapse in alcoholism. The lack of PET radiotracers to measure neurotransmitters that modulate stress is a major barrier to evaluating some of the most promising theories and novel therapeutic strategies advanced by basic investigations in human addicts. The proposed research aims to develop and characterize a specific radioligand that targets the NPY Y1 receptor system. The ability to non-invasively measure this receptor subsystem in humans will lead to insights related to the role of negative reinforcement and relapse in addiction. To date, no human studies have characterized the brain stress and anti-stress systems involved in negative reinforcement and relapse. The development of a specific NPY Y1 receptor ligand suitable for human research applications will be a significant step in characterizing a major component of the brain anti-stress system in addiction. The availability of a NPY Y1 PET tracer to use in humans will also be of interest to the study of other psychiatric and medical disorders such as anxiety, obesity, hypertension, epilepsy and certain carcinomas in which NPY Y1 has been implicated  "

Enable the identification and retrieval of all data that pertain to individal health by creating a data sharing architecture that is capacious enough for all relevant data types and that enables patient and institutional autonomy to be respected. 2. Test fully-scaled implementations of the proposed architecture early in the development process, with the active involvement of a committed user community that seeks to use allowed us to refine our designs to facilitate subsequent robust dissemination and adoption. 3. Provide commodity workflows that can be used to 'clean' and complete the often noisy and sparse data gathered in the course of observational studies. 4. Embrace decentralization while enabling the construction of a nationally or regionally-scaled patient-centered information commons. 5. Encourage the selection of standards through the tools that enable the construction of patient-centered information commons. 6. Employ diagnostic classification and prognostication as figures of merit to measure how well a patient-centered information commons adds the understanding of patient populations. In addition to the research and development agenda we have also taken on the development of educational opportunities for end user community to become more familiar with the methods and challenges of data science."
"9674978","ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide problem, which threatens to disarm important procedures in modern medicine, such as cancer therapy, organ transplantation, etc. P. aeruginosa is a significant source of hospital acquired infections and the leading cause of mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis. To combat antibiotic resistance new antibiotics and new targets are needed. We propose to validate iron homeostasis as a new target for future development of antibiotics. Bacterial iron homeostasis offers a significant vulnerability because essential iron must be obtained from the host, which makes the nutrient scarce to invading pathogens (nutritional immunity). Pathogens have evolved mechanisms to ?steal? iron from their host, but these depend on well-regulated iron homeostasis. We are targeting the protein/protein interactions between the iron storage protein bacterioferritin (BfrB) and its associated ferredoxin (Bfd), which are necessary to regulate cytosolic iron concentrations. Importantly, BfrB and Bfd exist only in bacteria. The proposed work builds from our crystal structure of the BfrB:Bfd complex, and from having shown that blocking the BfrB:Bfd interaction disrupts iron homeostasis, causes P. aeruginosa cells to become iron deficient, and significantly less virulent in C. elegans model of infection. Our approach is multidisciplinary and involves investigators with expertise in bacterial iron metabolism and structural biology (Rivera), organic synthesis/drug discovery (Bunce), chemical biology and medicinal chemistry (Peterson), and microbiology (Chandler). The aims are to: 1) Develop small molecule probes for blocking the BfrB:Bfd interaction in vitro and in P. aeruginosa. (A) We will utilize structure based-design principles to develop promising molecules obtained from screening a small library into potent inhibitors of the BfrB:Bfd interaction. (B) Screen a large library to find additional molecules that bind BfrB. These will be subjected to co-crystallization trials with BfrB, and the emerging structural information used to guide their synthetic elaboration into probes capable of blocking the BfrB:Bfd interaction. 2) Study the consequences of perturbing the BfrB:Bfd interaction in P. aeruginosa using genetic and chemical intervention. We will use genetic techniques to interrogate the effects of blocking the BfrB:Bfd interaction on iron homeostasis in P. aeruginosa. As we learn about these effects using gene deletions and mutations to the chromosome, we will use the emerging information as a benchmark to evaluate the efficacy of the chemical probes developed in Aim 1. The new probes will serve as the first-ever molecular tools for interrogating bacterial iron homeostasis, first in a model organism such as P. aeruginosa PAO1, then in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, and ultimately in other pathogenic bacteria where the BfrB:Bfd interaction is conserved."
"9416709","PROJECT SUMMARY Soluble adenylyl cyclases generate a cAMP signal that breaks down microtubules leading to endothelial cell barrier disruption. The P. aeruginosa type 3 secretion system effector exoenzyme Y is one such soluble cyclase. However, we have discovered that this enzyme is a promiscuous nucleotidyl cyclase capable of generating both purine and pyrimidine (i.e. non-canonical) cyclic nucleotide monophosphates, including cGMP, cUMP, and cAMP. The cAMP signal, and to a lesser extent the cGMP signal, activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates tau leading to microtubule breakdown. Phosphorylated tau accumulates inside the endothelium for several hours as a high molecular weight, or oligomeric, form, and is then released from the cell into the supernatant in vitro, and bronchoalveolar lavage and blood in vivo. Preliminary data suggest cellular release of high molecular weight tau is stimulated by cUMP. Our previously published work and recent preliminary studies indicate high molecular weight tau retrieved from cellular supernatant fractions is heat stable, protease resistant, insoluble in certain detergents, insensitive to RNase and DNase treatments, and can be resolved in a 30-50% ammonium sulfate fraction by column chromatography. It can be sedimented by centrifugation with an angular momentum of 1.14 x 1012. This high molecular weight tau is transmissible between cells, leading to inter-endothelial cell gap formation, increased permeability and cytotoxicity; pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells are especially sensitive to this injury. Its cytotoxicity is inactivated by phenol extraction, by post-translational modification with diethylpyrocabonate, and with hexafluoro-2- propanol, all characteristics of amyloid proteins. We have searched for a means to prevent the transmissible cytotoxicity as an anti-inflammatory therapy. We have recently discovered that prion protein is expressed in lung endothelium. Whereas prion antibody treatment initiates a pro-survival signal and prevents tau-induced hyperpermeability and cytotoxicity, prion protein genetic deletion increases endothelial sensitivity to the high molecular weight tau. Hence, this proposal tests the hypothesis that ExoY generates purine and pyrimidine cyclic nucleotides in endothelium and induces release of high molecular weight tau capable of generating transmissible hyperpermeability and cytotoxicity, an effect prevented by antibody ligation of prion protein."

"9478856","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Inflammatory skin conditions, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and contact hypersensitivity are often associated with unpleasant sensations of pain and itch. It is unclear whether and to what extent these sensations of discomfort may play an active role in initiating and maintaining cutaneous inflammation. Work in this area must take into account that there are different subsets of nociceptive peripheral nerve fibers that transmit distinct painful stimuli, including noxious heat, cold, mechanical pressure and itch.  In preliminary work for this project, we have discovered that a subset of sensory neurons responsive to specific painful stimuli is essential for the development of psoriasiform dermatitis in murine skin. In this model inflammation is initiated and sustained by the local production of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-17. Using both pharmacological and genetic models of selective nociceptor ablation, we observed that specific sensory neurons are in close proximity to skin-resident dendritic cells (DCs) and are critical for the production of IL-23 by DCs, which i necessary to promote subsequent IL-17 secretion by cutaneous T cells. Here we propose to test the hypothesis that dermal somatosensation by nociceptors plays an active role in regulating inflammatory skin responses by controlling the production of key cytokines by tissue-resident immune cells. Our experimental approach will allow us to define how distinct pain sensations contribute to regulating different branches of the innate and adaptive cutaneous immune system. If successful, these aims will enhance both our fundamental knowledge of neuro-immune interactions at a barrier tissue and also identify novel therapeutic targets to alleviate and treat inflammatory skin disease.  To test our hypothesis, we propose two Aims that are supported by extensive preliminary data: Aim 1: To investigate the impact of nociceptive sensory neurons on cutaneous inflammatory responses. We will provide a comprehensive overview of the relationship between distinct pain modalities and inflammatory modules that drive Type 1, Type 2 or Type 17 responses in the skin Aim 2. To characterize the regulation of dendritic cells by nociceptors. We will phenotype and visualize dendritic cell behavior in response to neural modulation in the skin."
"9584494","PROJECT SUMMARY Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), an autonomously replicating human parvovirus, causes acute respiratory tract infections in young children. Currently, neither vaccines nor specific therapeutic approaches have been developed for HBoV1-casued acute respiratory tract infections. We have established a cell culture system to produce HBoV1 and used the in vitro culture model of polarized human airway epithelium (HAE) at an air-liquid interface (ALI) to study HBoV1 infection. On the other side, cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease affecting 30,000 people in USA alone. Utilizing the high apical tropism of airway and large size of the HBoV1 genome, we developed a chimeric parvoviral vector, rAAV2/HBoV1, as an efficient airway transduction vector for CF lung disease gene therapy. rAAV2/HBoV1 is generated through pseudopackaging an oversized recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (rAAV2) genome (up to 5.9-kb) into the HBoV1 capsid, and it is capable of delivering effective expression of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to correct the CFTR-specific ion channel deficiency in CF HAE-ALI cultures. More importantly, rAAV2/HBoV1 vector is able to transduce the lungs of ferrets, and CF ferret models closely manifest the phenotype of human CF lung diseases. The co- development of vector and the CF animal model facilitate the preclinical study of CF lung disease gene therapy toward clinical application. Comparative study of HBoV1 infection and rAAV2/HBoV1 transduction in HAE-ALI suggests that rAAV2/HBoV1 vector reassembles the biology of HBoV1 capsid. The transduction of rAAV2/HBoV1 demonstrates unique apical tropism and dependence on cell polarization as does the HBoV1. Although it enters both polarized and non-polarized airway epithelial cells, productive transduction only takes place in polarized HAE. Thus, the development of rAAV2/HBoV1 also provides a powerful means to study the biology of HBoV1 capsid, in which our knowledge is currently limited. In this project, we aim to identify the cellular receptor(s) for HBoV1 capsid entry and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the HBoV1 receptor- mediated endocytosis and intracellular trafficking in polarized HAE. Our central hypothesis is that HBoV1 utilizes the same receptors on both polarized and non-polarized cells for binding and endocytosis, while the polarization creates an intracellular environment that is in favor of productive transduction. We will use rAAV2/HBoV1 as a tool to identify the glycan-binding attachment and proteinaceous receptors for HBoV1 and to investigate the entry and intracellular trafficking pathways of the HBoV1 capsid in polarized HAE. The success of this project will reveal the key checkpoints that block the interactions between host factors and HBoV1 capsid, which are crucial to the development of antiviral therapeutic strategies and to the optimization of the gene therapy approach to CF lung disease using the rAAV2/HBoV1 vector."

All-comers extensive benchmarking will be performed on all implementations within and external to our center to identify best-of-breed and results made broadly available. Design will be in part driven by the needs of a diverse set of separately funded specific biomedical projects that will serve as pilots.  These include the Pan-Cancer whole genome analysis project of the International Cancer Genomics Consortium to analyze 2,000 cancer genomes, the UK10K project to analyze 10,000 personal genomes, the UCSF-led I-SPY2 adaptive breast cancer trial, and the omics-guided leukemia therapy project BeatAML at Oregon Health Sciences University."
"9500927","SUMMARY Alcohol use disorders are in part characterized by the loss of control over alcohol drinking and the emergence of negative emotionality during abstinence from alcohol. While the brain regions and neurotransmitter systems affected by chronic alcohol exposure are well characterized, our understanding of the specific neural circuits driving drinking escalation and negative affect during withdrawal remains limited. We have generated data indicating that neurons located in the parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN), a small region of the posterior lateral hypothalamus whose function in addiction is currently unknown, may be a critical component of this circuitry. Specifically, we show that chemogenetic stimulation of PSTN neurons expressing the neuropeptide corticotropin- releasing factor (CRF) replicates the behavioral symptomatology of withdrawal and that PSTN neurons become activated in ethanol-dependent mice experiencing withdrawal. A first aim of this proposal is to explore the mechanisms underlying the phenotypes resulting from the chemogenetic activation of PSTN CRF neurons. We will evaluate the contribution of PSTN neurons projecting to the central nucleus of the amygdala (as opposed to other targets of the PSTN) and the role of CRF signaling (as opposed to other neurotransmitters co-released by PSTN CRF neurons). Another goal is to test the hypothesis that the PSTN is a critical node of the neuronal network driving the behavioral symptomatology of ethanol withdrawal. We will determine whether the activation of PSTN neurons is necessary to the expression of withdrawal symptoms in dependent mice, whether it drives the activation of downstream central amygdala neurons, and which neurotransmitter is implicated. Finally, we aim to understand how PSTN neurons become activated during ethanol withdrawal. We will use retrograde tracing combined with c-Fos mapping as well as electrophysiological recordings to investigate the mechanisms controlling the activity of PSTN neurons in the context of ethanol withdrawal. Throughout the project, we will leverage state-of-the-art genetic tools for the functional manipulation of specific neural pathways, local silencing of gene expression and neuronal mapping, along with whole-brain imaging. In addition, we will use a well- validated mouse model of ethanol dependence that we have refined with novel measures of affective perturbation. Altogether, the proposed experiments are designed to enhance our understanding of the neural circuitry that contributes to motivational and emotional dysfunction in alcohol use disorders and may provide novel avenues for the development of more efficacious treatments."
"9448326","The short term goal is to understand how fat cells are created in vivo and what determines their metabolic phenotype, with a long term goal of manipulating adipocyte phenotypes for therapeutic benefit. During the past funding cycle our laboratory established several important principles of in vivo adipogenesis that provide a foundation for further investigation. Specifically, we have shown that adipogenesis occurs in well-defined tissue niches and involves critical interactions among stromal cell populations that include committed progenitors, resident immune cells, and vascular cells. The renewal application will build upon these observations by further deconstructing specific adipogenic niches that generate therapeutically beneficial phenotypes.  The first aim will deconstruct the adipogenic niche in classic brown adipose tissue by providing a comprehensive and unbiased identification of BAT stromal cell types using the emerging technologies of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH). In complementary mechanistic experiments, we will determine how ?1-adrenergic receptors control recruitment of brown adipocyte progenitors and proliferation of resident macrophages and endothelial cells. These experiments will also determine whether cyclic AMP-dependent neogenesis is a general property of preadipocytes in subcutaneous and visceral fat, using a novel chemogenetic approach.  The second aim will investigate the origins and functions of distinct anabolic and catabolic adipocytes within subcutaneous adipose tissue. We will first establish whether catabolic and anabolic phenotypes can be derived from a single progenitor using a novel clonal tracing technology. Next, we will use scRNA-seq and smFISH to determine the temporal stability of these phenotypes in vivo. In addition, we will directly determine whether the putative metabolic phenotypes separately mediate lipid oxidation/turnover and synthesis using stable isotope tracing. Finally, we will investigate molecular mechanisms of phenotype selection and stability using a novel cell reporter line.  Overall, the proposed work will provide the first comprehensive, unbiased, and systematic analysis of cell types that comprise BAT and ingAT. We will deconstruct cellular interactions and mechanisms guiding brown adipocyte recruitment in vivo. This work will also investigate the new, unexpected metabolic flexibility of subcutaneous adipocytes using innovative cellular and molecular approaches. Together, this work will greatly advance our understanding of cellular and metabolic plasticity of adipogenic niches, and will guide therapeutic efforts for establishing and maintaining beneficial cellular phenotypes."
"9606360","PROJECT SUMMARY  The global health burden from malaria in 2015 included >200 million new cases and ~500,000 deaths, principally in sub-Saharan Africa. Most malaria deaths occur due to infection with Plasmodium falciparum in children under 5, resulting from severe disease that may include severe anemia. Severe malarial anemia is a significant global health issue, thus understanding how Plasmodium infection causes anemia is important in understanding the pathogenesis of malaria and in treating this dangerous condition. During homeostasis, the circulating red blood cell (RBC) count is determined by the input of newly differentiated RBC that enter the circulation from the bone marrow and the loss of aged or senescent RBC through phagocytosis by macrophages, principally in the spleen, in a process known as hemophagocytosis. Anemia can result from a reduction in erythropoiesis or an increase in hemophagocytosis, and both processes have been documented in situations of severe malarial anemia. Severe anemia also occurs during macrophage activation syndrome, a spectrum of disorders with high morbidity that have in common unbridled macrophage activation leading to a variety of pathologies, including anemia due to hemophagocytosis. We have recently identified a novel population of monocyte-derived hemophagocytic macrophages that cause macrophage activation syndrome in a model of dysregulated TLR7 signaling. These unique hemophagocytic macrophages, found in the bone marrow and spleen, are required for anemia in this model. Strikingly, in preliminary experiments, we have found similar hemophagocytic macrophages in the spleen during blood stage infection with Plasmodium yoelii 17XNL containing infected RBC. We propose that severe malarial anemia is a form of MAS, and that investigating how hemophagocytic macrophages differentiate during Plasmodium infection and contribute to severe malarial anemia will provide novel insights in how to inhibit this process and thereby prevent mortality. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that hemophagocytic macrophages differentiate from monocytes in response to TLR7 and/or TLR9 signals during P. yoelii 17XNL infection and are required for severe malarial anemia. We will use blood stage P. yoelii 17XNL infection in C57BL/6 mice for these studies."
"9495757","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In this P01 proposal entitled ?Pathophysiology of genetically defined dementia and neurodegeneration: Defining therapeutic targets and pathways,? we seek to push forward the development of precise medicines to treat debilitating diseases associated with C9ORF72 G4C2 repeat expansions, the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Success in developing a treatment for c9FTD/ALS will require a well-orchestrated effort that addresses multiple aspects of the drug discovery process. To improve the prognosis for patients suffering from c9FTD/ALS, we thus propose to investigate pathomechanisms by which C9ORF72 G4C2 repeat expansions cause disease, as well as develop bioactive small molecules and biomarkers. We have assembled a world- class team combining expertise in chemistry, neurology, cell biology, disease modeling, and biomarker development that has worked closely together and has all resources in place. Our significant progress to elucidate how expanded G4C2 repeat RNA transcripts drive toxicity and how to abrogate aberrant features associated with c9FTD/ALS has led to the discovery of: (i) novel pathomechanisms caused by the accumulation of G4C2 repeat RNA or ?c9RAN proteins? unconventionally translated from G4C2 repeat RNA; (ii) the first small molecule known to influence c9FTD/ALS disease biology; and (iii) a first-in- class biomarker to investigate new therapeutic strategies.  We now bring forward novel and innovative chemical approaches to develop and optimize chemical probes to study and mitigate c9FTD/ALS disease mechanisms. We also present evidence that nucleocytoplasmic transport defects may be a fundamental pathway of c9FTD/ALS pathogenesis amenable to therapy. Indeed, we reported that disruption of the nuclear pore complex and nucleocytoplasmic transport is a primary cause of neurodegeneration in Drosophila and patient-derived cell models of c9FTD/ALS. In addition, we have established that poly(GP) c9RAN proteins are not only detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from c9FTD/ALS patients but also in peripheral blood lymphocytes. What is more, preliminary data suggest that CSF poly(GP) levels associate with clinical features of disease. As such, poly(GP) proteins may prove useful in monitoring disease severity and rate of progression. Building upon these exciting findings, our multi-disciplinary studies will improve understanding of C9ORF72-related neurodegeneration, identify therapeutic targets and potential clinical and pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and lead to the design of bioactive small molecules with therapeutic potential. Combined, our efforts are anticipated to accelerate the discovery of an effective therapy for c9FTD/ALS."

"9459321","PROJECT SUMMARY Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have up to a 2.8-fold greater fracture risk than non-diabetics and worse clinical outcomes after a fracture, including higher morbidity and increased mortality rates compared to non- diabetics. Thus, due to the huge and growing number of affected individuals and profound personal and health care costs, diabetic skeletal fragility is an important public health concern. Patients with T2D have normal to high bone mineral density, which usually is protective against fractures. Thus, the mechanisms underlying diabetic skeletal fragility are poorly understood, making it difficult for clinicians to identify those at risk and develop appropriate interventions to prevent fractures. Because BMD is normal or high in T2D, deficits in bone quality or microarchitecture have been implicated in diabetic skeletal fragility. Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) result from non-enzymatic biochemical reactions between reduced extracellular sugars and amino acid residues on proteins, including collagen, and accumulation of AGEs in various tissues are involved in the pathogenesis of many diabetic complications. Accumulation of AGEs in bone can deteriorate bone's mechanical integrity. Our overall goals are to determine the biomechanical mechanisms underlying increased skeletal fragility in patients with T2D, and to identify clinical tools that may assist in predicting fracture risk and preventing fractures in T2D. In a cross-sectional study of adults with T2D and age- and sex-matched non- diabetic controls undergoing total hip replacement surgery, we will collect femoral head and neck specimens, assess microarchitecture by microcomputed tomography, measure mechanical properties by reference point indentation and compression testing, quantify microdamage in 3D by ultra-high resolution computed tomography (nanoCT), and measure bone AGE content by high performance liquid chromatography and fluorometric assays. Also, to determine whether clinical assessments of glycemic control and/or AGE accumulation are associated with bone AGE levels, we will utilize subjects recruited for Aim 1 to correlate serum pentosidine, skin AGE content (assessed by non-invasive skin autofluorescence) and serum HbA1c levels to the concentration of AGEs in the bone itself. This project will have high impact, as the results will provide novel information regarding the mechanisms contributing to skeletal fragility in T2D, and therefore allow for improved clinical management of diabetic patients who are susceptible to fractures."
"9512588","ABSTRACT More than one million people have been displaced to Lebanon by the civil war in Syria. The vast majority lives amongst the five million Lebanese and interact with them daily. At the same time, HIV prevalence has increased among Lebanese men who have sex with other men (MSM) from <2% in 2010 to >10% in 2014- 15. In our recent study of 290 MSM in the Beirut area, 25% were born in Syria. They experienced more discrimination and abuse, were more likely to exchange sex for drugs, money, or goods, and less likely to have ever been tested for HIV than their Lebanese-born counterparts. We are proposing an exploratory study to obtain a larger sample of 1,000 MSM consisting approximately of 60% Syrian-born and 40% Lebanese-born MSM to (1) confirm the increased HIV prevalence in the MSM population, (2) quantify differences in HIV testing rates and HIV incidence, and (3) determine differences in access to and retention in HIV treatment for those testing HIV positive. Using the Minority Stress Model, we aim to explore if forced migration, minority stress, stigma associated with both sexual minority and refugee status, mental health difficulties, the lack of economic opportunity, and sexual and substance use behaviors among Syrian MSM living in Lebanon, in comparison to their Lebanese-born counterparts, are associated with lower rates of HIV testing among Syrian-born MSM, increased sexual risk taking, and diminished access to HIV care. These will be ascertained from the data collected from the thousand MSM and augmented by qualitative data collected from a subsample of 72 men, 24 who are HIV-positive and 24 low risk and 24 high-risk HIV- negative men of both Syrian and Lebanese nationality. Qualitative data collection and analysis will focus on personal life histories of significant events, social and sexual relationships, migratory experiences, socio- economic and substance use influences on sexual behavior, and access to and use of HIV prevention and treatment services. A mixed methods approach will combine the quantitative and qualitative data obtained through this exploratory study with the intention of developing one or more interventions to reduce HIV incidence and increase access to and retention in HIV care in a country in which HIV prevalence in the MSM population has been rapidly increasing. The opportunity here is to identify, respond to, and prevent an incipient HIV epidemic occurring within a context of massive population displacement and migration."
"9477092","?    DESCRIPTION:  In occlusive vascular diseases, dissolution of thrombus and rapid restoration of blood flow is critical in preventing tissue morbidity and mortality. To this end, current clinicl `clot-busting' strategies using intravascular systemic administration of thrombolytic drugs like tPA present issues of plasma-induced drug deactivation, short plasma half-life of drugs, rapid drug washout, reduced drug availability at target site, and systemic hemorrhagic side effects. These issues can be potentially resolved by controlled release of the drugs from injectable delivery vehicles that can selectively accumulate at the clot site under hemodynamic flow. For this, it is necessary for the vehicles to (i) actively bind to the clot site, (ii) stay retained uner flow, and (iii) allow localized drug release for site-selective action. For designing such a vehicl, natural platelets provide an excellent paradigm, since platelets have the innate capability to marginate towards the vascular wall, bind actively to clot via specific ligand-receptor interactions, and release cytoplasmic contents to modulate clot activities. The margination of platelets towards the vascular wall is facilitated by their discoid shape, ~2 µ diameter size and ~25-50 kPa modulus, while their active binding at the thrombus site is mediated via ligands fibrinogen (Fg) and PSGL-1 binding to platelet surface integrin GPIIb-IIIa and P-selectin respectively. Inspired by these physico-mechanical and biointeractive cues of natural platelets, we propose to engineer vehicles that will have (i) platelet-mimetic shape, size and modulus to facilitate enhanced margination towards the vascular wall, and (ii) heteromultivalent surface-decoration with GPIIb-IIIa- and P-selectin-binding peptide ligands to enable thrombus-selective anchorage and retention under hemodynamic flow. Our central hypothesis is that controlled release of thrombolytic drugs from such platelet-inspired vehicles anchoring at the thrombus site will enhance the site-specific therapeutic efficacy, while minimizing systemic drug distribution and side-effects. To test this, we will fabricate albumin-based platelet-inspired discoid flexible vehicles, modify their surface heteromultivalently with the active platelet-targeting ligands and evaluate their thrombus anchoring capability in vitro and in vivo (Aim1). In parallel, we will cationically modify tPA (mtPA) to facilitate its loading into the albumin particles since albumin i negatively charged at physiological pH, and characterize the loading and release of mtPA from these particles in vitro (Aim 2). After optimizing the platelet-inspired thrombus- anchoring mechanisms and the mtPA loading/release kinetics via these two synergistic yet independent aims, we will integrate them to create mtPA-loaded platelet-inspired vehicles which will be evaluated for targeted thrombolysis efficacy in vitro and in vivo (Aim 3). Our principal innovation is the design of a delivery vehicle that combines key physico-mechanical and biointeractive parameters inspired by platelets for enhanced thrombus-anchoring ability. The current application will test this technology for targeted thrombolytic therapy. The technology also holds the promise to become a platform for other targeted therapies in vascular diseases."
"9479141","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dysfunctions of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are associated with hypertrophy, hyperplasia and fibrosis found in SM diseases including gastrointestinal (GI) bowel obstruction and Hirschprung's disease. Defective SMCs are dedifferentiated cells that have lost their contractile phenotype. The phenotypic change of SMCs to non- functional dedifferentiated cells has been discovered in vascular injuries ~50 years ago, but the phenotypic and genetic identity of the transformed cells are still unknown. We have found that the transformed cells in the hypertrophic small intestine are myofibroblast like cells that weakly express platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFRa/ß) (called PDGFRalowßhigh cells). We have isolated differentiated PDGFRahigh cells and SMCs from colon and jejunum, and obtained genome scale gene expression profiles. By analyzing the transcriptomes, we identified SMC-specific transcription factors including SRF and MYOCD. Moreover, we found that the phenotype of SMCs is regulated by SRF and an epigenetic modulator DNA methyltransferase 1 and 3a (DNMT1/3a). The present project seeks to uncover a cellar and genetic mechanism for understanding how SMCs are dedifferentiated during the development of intestinal SM hypertrophy and how dedifferentiated cells are redifferentiated into SMCs during the recovery process. Furthermore, this project aims to isolate dedifferentiated cells, establish a cell line in culture, and genetically engineer SMCs from the cell line using SMC-specific transcription factors and the epigenetic regulator DNMT1/3a. To achieve these aims, we have formed a collaborative, multi-institutional research team with Drs. Seungil Ro (PhD, PI), Moon young Lee (MD/PhD, studying the plasticity of SMCs in the hypertrophic condition), a to-be-hired postdoc (PhD, studying the engineering of SMCs from PDGRFalow cells), Douglas Redelman (PhD, cell isolation), Gabsang Lee (PhD/DVM, cell line establishment), Terence Smith (PhD, calcium imaging), Laren Becker (MD/PhD, tissue supply and consulting), Kent Sasse (MD, tissue supply), and Joseph Miano and Kenton Sanders (PhDs, research tool supply and project consulting). These studies will significantly advance our understanding on the phenotypic transition of SMCs at the transcriptome level and could offer a human SMC line for clinical use to repair damaged or non-functional SMCs found in GI SM diseases."

"9481273","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a five year training program for development of a career in basic research and academic pediatric pathology. The principal investigator has completed a combined M.D./Ph.D. program, residency and fellowship training in anatomic and pediatric pathology, and 2 years of postdoctoral research. The training period will allow for development of an independent research program, as well as provide experience as an independently-practicing pediatric pathologist focusing on the diagnosis of pediatric gastrointestinal and liver disease.  Research during the training program will focus on the attainment of expertise in studying the pathophysiology of pediatric liver disease through in vivo modeling in zebrafish. The zebrafish system provides many of the advantages of classical genetic and developmental models, combined with the vertebrate body plan of mammals, and has been validated as a model system for liver development and disease. Research will be performed under the mentorship of Dr. Michael Pack at the University of Pennsylvania, an expert in zebrafish models of gastrointestinal development and disease, as well as a mentoring committee of outstanding physician-scientists with expertise in zebrafish models, biliary disease, and the training of young physician-scientists.  Infantile cholestasis is caused by numerous etiologies, many of which are rare single-gene defects that affect biliary development or function. Study of the genes involved in these cholangiopathies through animal modeling often leads to further understanding of both normal liver development, as well as the pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to disease. One such gene is CIRH1A/hUTP4, mutated in North American Indian Childhood Cirrhosis (NAIC), a disease that presents clinically and histologically as obstructive cholestasis but with an intact biliary tree. CIRH1A is unique among genes involved in cholangiopathies, in that it encodes a nucleolar protein (CIRHIN) that functions in ribosome biogenesis, as demonstrated by prior in vitro experiments. The role of ribosome biogenesis in biliary development is unknown. The research plan will utilize transgenic and gene-targeting methods in zebrafish to test the hypothesis that Cirhin is necessary for normal biliary development and function. The specific aims include: 1) Generate zebrafish models of cirh1a inhibition to investigate the pathophysiologic mechanism of NAIC, and 2) Determine the mechanism of Cirhin action; specifically, investigate the role of Nol11/Cirhin interactions in biliary development. These studies will provide the first in vivo models for studying Cirhin function, and the first animal models of NAIC. In addition, molecular mechanisms for NAIC pathogenesis uncovered by these models will also be more broadly applicable to other diseases caused by ribosomal dysfunction (ribosomopathies).  The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) provides an excellent venue for developing expertise in pediatric liver disease. CHOP is a world leader in pediatric disease care and research. The Biesecker Center for Pediatric Liver Disease brings together clinicians and researchers from numerous disciplines at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania to promote the study of a variety of developmental liver disorders. The Division of Anatomic Pathology at CHOP is a supportive training environment, and has a clinical expertise in the diagnosis of pediatric gastrointestinal and liver disease. Interaction wih colleagues, in both local forums and national meetings, will complement the proposed research and career development program to foster development of an independent academic career."
"9470861","In this K24 renewal application, I am seeking funding to continue support for my mentoring activities in patient oriented research (POR), engage in further career development activities, conduct POR with mentees, and conduct three pilot studies that expand the aims of my current grants. My work is focused on the devel- opment, evaluation, and dissemination of adaptive, patient-oriented treatment models across the continuum of care for substance use disorders (SUD). Much of this work is concerned with identifying the treatment compo- nents and features that promote sustained participation and better outcomes, including adaptive protocols that address patient nonresponse, mobile health communication technology, and incentives.  I will continue to mentor postdoctoral fellows and new clinician investigators at UPENN, the Treatment Research Institute (TRI), and other institutions, and will add additional mentees. This work will include time spent in planning, reviewing, and providing feedback on manuscripts and grant applications; giving career counseling; and providing further training in the design and evaluation of adaptive treatment interventions for substance use disorders, sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) designs, and mobile health technology. For this renewal, mentees will include a number of junior faculty members from the University of Michigan (UMICH), with interest in adaptive treatment, SMART designs, and continuing care.  With regard to career development, I will obtain additional knowledge in behavioral econom- ics/incentives, new developments in adaptive treatments and SMART designs, and mobile health technology. To that end, I will attend workshops at UPENN at the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics, and consult with current collaborators at the University of Connecticut (UCONN; Dr. Nancy Petry), University of Wisconsin (UWISC; Dr. David Gustafson), UMICH (Dr. Susan Murphy), and North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System (NSLIJHS; Drs. Jon Morgenstern and Fred Muench) who are experts in these areas.  I am currently the PI of a NIAAA R01 and a DoD grant equivalent to an R01, and a co-investigator on a NIDA R01 awarded to Dr. Alan Budney at Dartmouth and on a NIAAA R01 awarded to Dr. Jon Morgenstern at NSLIJHS. All of these projects are randomized clinical trials. My NIAAA R01 is testing the relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of telephone continuing care, an automated smartphone recovery app, and an integrat- ed protocol that combines these two interventions. The DoD grant is evaluating the efficacy of an adaptive prevention intervention designed to reduce hazardous alcohol and benzodiazepine use in veterans taking opi- oid medications for pain. Funds are requested to conduct three pilot studies addressing: (1) Counselor percep- tions of use and value of mobile technology as a clinician extender in SUD treatment, (2) Patient use of differ- ent mobile heath technology functions and their contributions to SUD outcomes, and (3) Further work on tailor- ing of adaptive interventions for SUD."
"9663390","PROJECT SUMMARY  Recent advances in cell reprogramming have raised considerable interest in the use of stem cells for regenerative therapies to replace damaged or lost cells. Stem cells integrate a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic cues to maintain their fate and proliferative capacity. Importantly, these cues include steroid hormones, which fluctuate during childhood growth and development, pregnancy, and disease, and nuclear hormone receptors, which receive steroid signals to regulate physiological homeostasis. A basic understanding of how stem cells respond to changes in human physiology is therefore a necessary prerequisite to the increased use of stem cells in clinical therapy. Like other nuclear hormone receptor signaling pathways, the insect steroid hormone ecdysone is known to elicit context-dependent cellular responses; however, it is largely unknown how these responses are achieved. The nuclear hormone receptor Ftz-f1 is an ecdysone target, but it is also required for the maximal transcriptional response of other ecdysone targets (namely, E74 and E75) in embryonic and larval tissues. This suggests that Ftz-f1 activity primes some cells to respond to ecdysone by up- regulating a specific transcriptional pathway. Despite the identification of mutant alleles nearly 25 years ago, no studies to date have addressed the function of Ftz-f1 in the ovary. Our studies will test the central hypothesis that Ftz-f1 acts as a competence factor for ecdysone signaling in the ovary. Germline stem cells (GSCs) in the Drosophila melanogaster ovary are well-suited for these studies, due to their easily accessible anatomical location, sensitivity to steroid hormones, and the availability of genetic and experimental techniques. Our studies will not only reveal important new information about the function of ftz-f1 in stem cells and reproduction, but can also serve as a novel paradigm for the study of context-dependent steroid hormone signaling in vivo. In my new independent lab, we will utilize Drosophila genetic mutants and in vivo cell-specific gene knockdown to investigate whether and how ftz-f1 regulates GSCs and their progeny, and test whether ftz-f1 primes specific cells for ecdysone signaling. In Aim 1, we will examine the role of ftz-f1 in the differentiation of GSCs and their progeny. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether ftz-f1 controls the cell cycle in GSCs and their progeny. In Aim 3, we will use genetic interaction experiments to determine whether ftz-f1 functionally interacts with ecdysone signaling. Given the similarity between Drosophila and human steroid hormone signaling, our study will help elucidate how nuclear hormone receptors differentially regulate context-dependent transcriptional pathways in vivo to control stem cell function."
"9487779","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tanzania is one of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa that is severely affected by the HIV epidemic. Despite substantial progress over the past decade, large gaps in implementing efficacious and safe HIV interventions remain - e.g., in male medical circumcision coverage and antiretroviral treatment (ART) and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) uptake, retention and adherence. At the same time, funders are increasingly demanding evidence on the population health impact of their investments; and national policy makers are struggling with questions how to ensure financial and operational sustainability of HIV programs within the context of the Tanzanian health system. To find solutions to these challenges, we need rigorous Implementation Science, Impact Evaluation, and Health Systems Research to test alternative models to deliver HIV interventions and establish their comparative feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness. However, the scientists to carry out such research projects are currently lacking in Tanzania. This program thus aims to (1) train a critical mass of mid-level and senior researchers to (a) work as principal investigators leading independent research programs focused on questions of HIV program implementation and evaluation and (b) teach HIV-related Implementation Science, Impact Evaluation, and Health Systems Research in Tanzania; (2) build a critical mass of junior public health and medical professionals who can design and successfully carry out rigorous research projects in HIV Implementation Science, Impact Evaluation, and Health Systems Research; and (3) develop a sustainable Master's program in HIV Implementation Science and Impact Evaluation in Dar es Salaam. This training program will be collaboration between the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) in Boston and Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS) in Dar es Salaam. Based on an in-depth needs assessment, we identified training gaps in three principal areas: HIV interventions; health systems and implementation; and research methods, including Implementation Science, Impact Evaluation, Health Economics, and Biostatistics. We have recruited training and mentoring faculty with practical and theoretical experience in these areas, as well as experienced colleagues for the Executive and the Training Advisory Committees. The primary training strategies in this program will comprise of (1) two-year post-doctoral fellowships in Boston and Dar es Salaam; (2) short-term fellowship training in Boston with ongoing mentoring; (3) intensive courses (which will serve as building blocks for the Master's program at MUHAS); and (4) research symposia. In total, the program will train 10 two-year post-doctoral fellows; 22 short-term post-doctoral fellows (12 post- and 10 pre-doctoral); and provide intensive short course instruction to 240 individuals."
"9481680","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Poor wound healing is a major health issue in insulin-resistant diabetes. Improved understanding of wound pathology, including the function of keratinocytes (KCs) in re-epithelialization, and new interventions for impaired wound healing are needed. Ganglioside GM3 is a glycosphingolipid that regulates receptor signaling at the membrane level. We have found that GM3 and GM3 synthase (GM3S) are increased in human and mouse diabetic skin. In addition, TNF?? and excess glucose-induced insulin resistance in KCs is associated with increased GM3 and reversed by GM3 depletion, suggesting that GM3 mediates diabetic wound healing impairment. Wounds heal normally in diet-induced obese (DIO) GM3 synthase knockout (GM3S-/-) mice, in contrast to delayed healing in DIO wildtype (WT) littermates. Furthermore, we have replicated reversal of this wound healing improvement in WT DIO diabetic mice by depleting GM3 with topically applied GM3S siRNA spherical nuclei acid (SNA) nanoparticle conjugates. Depleting GM3 by either GM3S SNA or GZ 161, a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, accelerates migration in 2D keratinocyte cultures by activating insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) and Rac1 signaling. Increases in GM3, including by treatment with excess glucose or chronic, low-dose TNF?, suppress IGF1R signaling and inhibit KC migration. Our long-term goals are to test GM3 depletion in skin as a novel means to reverse the impaired wound healing in diabetics and understand how GM3 inhibits IGF1R activation and suppresses keratinocyte migration. Our first aim is to optimize GM3 depletion-based intervention by comparing the ability of topical GM3S siRNA SNA and topical or oral GZ 161 to promote healing. We will test these therapeutic options in a DIO mouse with fluorescent sensory nerves to track the impact of treatment on cutaneous innervation. The most efficacious therapy will then be studied in a diabetic model with more chronic wounds, the biofilm-challenged db/db mouse. Using normal and diabetic 3D co-culture wound models, we will validate our observations in 2D KCs and will investigate the effects of GM3 modulation on the insulin/IGF-1 signaling axis (Aim 2). Finally, as our third aim and with a focus on IGF1R, we will elucidate the role of GM3 in regulating the membrane-based localization, dynamics, and molecular interactions of insulin/IGF-1 signaling. We will interrogate the direct interactions of IGF1R with GM3 and test our hypothesis that increased GM3 prevents IGF1R clathrin-mediated endocytosis and signaling. Finally, we will use FLIM to determine if GM3 depletion increases IR-IGF1R hybrid receptors to boost IGF-1 responses. These proposed studies will increase our understanding of the membrane-based dynamics that impact insulin/IGF-1 signaling in skin. Furthermore, acceleration of wound healing, whether by nano-delivery of gene suppression or small molecule inhibition of GM3 synthesis, could be fast-tracked towards translational application as a new treatment approach for diabetic wounds."
"9483255","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tendons and ligaments are dense connective tissues of mesodermal origin, which connect muscles to bones or bone to bone, and transmit mechanical force. The extracellular matrix (ECM) consists mainly of collagen type 1, organized as triple-helix polypeptide chains, which unite into fibrils, fibers, fascicles, tertiary bundles, forming the tendon and ligament architecture. Damage to tendons and ligaments caused by overuse or injuries is not healed and rarely recovers completely. In addition, to injury, aging-related changes in cells and ECM of ligaments and tendons represent an important risk factor for the development of knee osteoarthritis or rotator cuff syndrome. Obstacles in the development of approaches to address tendon and ligament damage are partly due to the limited knowledge about mechanisms that regulate development, adult tissue homoeostasis and regenerative responses following injury. We recently identified Mohawk (Mkx) as a key regulator of tendon and ligament development. Mkx is a member of the Three Amino acid Loop Extension superclass of atypical homeobox genes. Mkx-/- mice had hypoplastic tendons throughout the body, clearly demonstrating an essential function of Mkx in tendon development. Importantly, Mkx is highly expressed in adult human and mouse tenocytes and ligament cells but its expression is decreased in aging or in arthritis-affected joints and in response to inflammatory stimuli such as interleukin-1. These observations support our hypothesis that Mkx is a central regulator of adult tendon and ligament homeostasis and that its suppression following injury or during aging and arthritis accounts for limited repair responses and leads to degenerative changes. To test this hypothesis and reveal the molecular mechanisms of Mkx to maintain and/or regenerate tendon/ligament, we will perform the following studies. Aim 1: Determine Mkx targets and functions in tendon/ligament cells during development and after birth. Aim 2: Analyze mechanisms controlling tendon/ligament specific expression of Mkx. Aim 3: Examine role of Mkx in tenogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and its potential to enhance repair or regeneration of tendon injuries. Feasibility of this project is based on availability of several genetically modified mouse lines, including conditional Mkx TG and KO mice; access to human ligament cells from a wide range of donors across the adult age spectrum and at various stages of ACL degeneration and multiple genome-wide screening systems. The findings from this study are expected to advance our current understanding of tendon and ligament biology and serve as a basis for the development of new therapeutic approaches for tendon and ligament injuries and diseases."
"9479282","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Wake Forest Clinical Center Investigators will collaborate with and contribute to the goals and operations of the Wake Forest Clinical Center (WFCC), other Clinical Centers (CC) within the PETAL Network, the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) and NHLBI. The work proposed will organize and manage experienced personnel with expertise and leadership in the management of patients with and at risk for ALI including critical care, trauma, emergency general surgery and emergency medicine, for the purposes of fulfilling the RFA's request to support research in this patient population. The WFCC will be readily able to meet the long-term objectives and specific aims of the RFA by inclusion of 4 separate, outstanding research institutions with active Emergency Medicine and ICU research capabilities. The WFCC sites include: Wake Forest University Health Sciences (WFUHS), the University of Virginia Health System (UVaHS), the Moses Cone Health Systems (MCHS)) and the Virginia Commonwealth Health System (VCUHS). The WFCC will work to further develop and support PETAL protocols for clinical trials that will impact the outcome of patients at risk fo and with established ALI. Within the application, we propose 2 innovative protocols (the Vitamin C to prevent lung injury and a novel post-hospital discharge communication intervention to reduce hospital readmissions in Survivors of ALI/ARDs) for consideration by the Steering Committee, and commit our support to all active protocols selected during the course of the proposed funding period. The track record of WFCC's performance in the ARDSnetwork I and II demonstrated an enrollment of subjects above our predictions. Importantly, the WFCC, now with a 4th new site, is again well positioned to meet or exceed the enrollment requirements of 40 subjects at risk for ALI or with established ALI/ARDS per year over the 5.5 year Trial enrollment period for a minimum total of 220 patients enrolled over the full duration of the grant's period. The enrollment objective will include recognition of the need to address the distribution of enrolled subjects within important demographic groups."
"9693927","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Due to their relative chemical stability and ubiquity in the environment, chlorinated organic contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and trichloroethylene (TCE) pose significant health risks and enduring remediation challenges. For example, extensive PCB contamination at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, the largest Superfund site in Kentucky, is of major concern for its health consequences. The University of Kentucky Superfund Research Center (UK-SRC) provides a focused transdisciplinary research, training and translation environment to address human health challenges associated with such exposures. Preliminary findings suggest that nutrition-based concepts and exercise can markedly influence the mechanisms of toxicity of chlorinated organics. Indeed, healthful nutrition/nutritional components may provide a platform to develop primary prevention strategies for diseases associated with environmental toxic insults, while also providing the basis for new risk assessment paradigms. Further, novel iron-based, nano-structured capture/sensing and remediation systems based on biomimetic binding domains and functionalized/responsive membrane platforms offer potential for sustainable advances in technical capability for site remediation. The UK-SRC proposes to reduce risk by: 1) developing lifestyle-related modulators of environmental disease and elucidating relevant protective mechanisms, and 2) developing technologically effective and economically efficient methods for capture/sensing and remediation of PCBs. Three biomedical and two environmental science projects, a Research Support Core, and Administrative, Research Translation, Community Engagement and Training Cores collectively advance understanding of toxicant-induced mechanisms of disease, introduce sustainable approaches for remediation and enhance stakeholder and community capacity to act. Biomedical projects focus on models of inflammation and associated changes in redox status and inflammatory cytokines in vascular (Project 1), fetal (Project 2) and adipose (Project 3) tissues with relevance to atherosclerosis, insulin resistance/diabetes and obesity. Environmental science projects employ nanomaterials to create selective PCB-binding domains with high affinity and selectivity for PCBs (Project 4) and a functionalized polymer immobilized membrane platform to support PCB dechlorination (Project 5). All Projects focus on common PCB toxicants. Biomedical scientists, with the Research Support Core, also evaluate byproducts of environmental science projects for unintended effects. Use of PCBs as a model contaminant will advance understanding of inflammatory diseases associated with exposure to persistent chlorinated organic pollutants. Research results will lead to evidence-based multidirectional information/education, technology transfer, training, policy and translational activities via UK-SRC cores. Expected outcomes include positive lifestyle interventions across the lifespan for populations at risk and advanced technical capacity to reduce public health risks."
"9493506","PROJECT SUMMARY Our work is designed to provide new insights into understanding of signaling mechanisms responsible for the developmental control of organ growth. Our preliminary data have implicated Capicua (Cic) as a target of growth- controlling signaling pathways and suggest that Cic integrates several upstream signals to control organ size. Cic is a transcriptional repressor protein that is regulated by the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, which is one of the key systems involved in organ size control and tissue patterning in humans and model experimental animals. Our preliminary studies have identified a kinase Minibrain (Mnb) as a novel Cic regulator which acts in parallel to RTK/ERK signaling. ERK signaling components, Mnb (human DYRK1A), and Cic are highly conserved proteins, and alterations in their levels in humans result in several diseases, such as Rasopathies, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. DYRK1A has been actively investigated as one of the causative factors in Down syndrome, and is thought to be important for proper development and growth of the central nervous system. An exciting hypothesis that we pursue in this application is that signals from ERK and Mnb converge on Cic to regulate its activity as a growth suppressor. Given that human pathologies can result from quantitative changes in ERK and DYRK1A signaling, it is essential to apply quantitative approaches in order to understand the underlying mechanisms. Drosophila offers a unique opportunity to carry out such research in vivo. We propose to use this powerful experimental platform to carry out a quantitative and systems-level analysis of developmental signals controlling growth. We will use state-of- the-art proteomic methods, such as affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), to identify the binding partners of Cic in the embryo and analyze how upstream signals alter these interactions, which in turn leads to changes in Cic activity. We will then apply quantitative imaging assays to systematically test the identified interacting partners for their involvement in three molecular outcomes: Cic degradation, nuclear export, and inhibition of transcriptional repressor activity. Furthermore, we will investigate how Cic integrates signals from the ERK and Mnb kinases by identifying and functionally validating the phosphorylation sites targeted by these two kinases, and by testing the relative contributions of these kinases to Cic regulation and growth control in four independent in vivo assays. In summary, our multi-level experimental plan is designed to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of RTK/ERK signal interpretation by Cic, as well as to determine how these mechanisms intersect with the input from Mnb, a novel Cic regulator. In the long term, this work will advance our understanding of the complex regulatory relationships between the pathways involved in organ size control, and may suggest new targets for developing ERK, Cic, and DYRK1A-related therapies."
"9511815","Project Summary/Abstract Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem. African Americans have a higher prevalence of late stage CKD than Whites and progress from early stage to late stage at a much more rapid rate. Biomedical explanations for African Americans' faster CKD progression prevail, with virtually no research attention paid to the role of social factors. Stress related to discrimination is a particularly compelling area of study in light of strong evidence demonstrating its linkages to CKD risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. The proposed proof of concept study will recruit 100 African American patients (both with and without diagnosed CKD) to determine whether discriminatory stressors are an important risk factor for CKD-related physiological processes and kidney functioning. The long-term goal of this research program is to understand the impact of and pathways through which discriminatory stress contributes to CKD progression. The overall objective of this R21 application, which is the first step towards attainment of this long-term goal, is to obtain effect sizes for a larger prospective R01 and explore two hypothesized pathways (i.e., blood pressure reactivity and pathophysiological mechanisms) using a multi-method research design. This study will carry out the following specific aims: 1. To examine associations between chronic stressors (i.e., discriminatory versus general),  pathophysiological mechanisms (i.e., elevated inflammation and nocturnal blood pressure),  and poor kidney functioning among 100 African American patients.  a. Based on a cross-sectional research design, we hypothesize that chronic discriminatory  stressors will be associated with poor kidney functioning independent of other chronic  stressors as mediated by CKD-related inflammatory biomarkers and autonomic arousal. 2. To examine the impact of acute stressors (i.e., discriminatory versus general) on short-term  changes in CKD-related physiological processes (i.e., increases in inflammatory markers  and blood pressure reactivity) in patients from aim 1.  a. Based on an experimental research design, we hypothesize that discriminatory stressors  will be more physiologically impactful than general stressors. Outcomes include several  critical CKD-related inflammatory biomarkers and blood pressure reactivity assessed at  three time points during the experimental manipulation. Collectively, these outcomes are expected to support the advancement of science-based information about CKD that can be disseminated in order to improve health and quality of life."
"9621338","Project Summary: Despite immense efforts in behavioral interventions to promote safe sexual practices, vaginal HIV transmission continues to be pandemic worldwide. An HIV-specific, safe, effective and discreet vaginal method that does not require daily or sex-associated dosing may provide a powerful prevention tool addressing the current gap in behavioral and pharmacological interventions. Human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) delivered locally to the vagina offer exceptional promise combining safety, efficacy and unparalleled specificity. Importantly, by delivering mAb to the vagina rather than systemically, far lower doses of mAb are needed to reduce the risks of vaginal HIV transmission, leading to orders of magnitude in cost savings. Adding further to the promise of vaginal applications of mAb, the Lai and Cone Labs recently discovered a novel IgG effector function in mucus ? IgGs that trap individual pathogens in mucus ? and have pioneered a technology enhancing the potency of mAb in mucosal secretions based on carefully-tuned affinity between IgG-Fc and mucins. We have shown that engineered mAb can consistently trap Herpes viruses in human cervicovaginal mucus (CVM) across the menstrual cycle and from women with diverse vaginal microbiota, with 10-fold greater potency than protection by neutralization. Trapping alone (with a non-neutralizing mAb) directly prevented vaginal Herpes transmission in mice. In pilot studies, we also found that anti-HIV mAb VRC01 can similarly trap HIV in CVM. Currently, the major hurdle to translating this vaginal immunoprophylaxis strategy for HIV is a method for sustained delivery of mAb at low doses. Vaginal microbicide trials have shown that methods that do not require daily or sex- associated dosing, such as intravaginal rings (IVR), are far more likely to maximize user compliance. Unfortunately, most current IVRs are designed to deliver small molecule drugs, and are ill-suited for delivering mAb, particularly at low release rates. To address this, Mucommune has been developing a unique capsule- containing IVR system that can provide sustained release of appropropriate doses of mAb for over 30 days, while protecting the encapsulated mAb from degradation in the vaginal environment. Our goal here is to design and formulate a capsule-IVR that can continuously release into human CVM 0.05-0.2 mg/day of two promising broadly neutralizing mAb against HIV (VRC01 and N6). In Aim 1, we will load mAb into capsules, measure release kinetics in vaginal simulant buffer, and characterize mAb integrity before/after loading and after release. In Aim 2, we will incubate mAb-loaded capsules in fresh human CVM, and measure the HIV neutralization and trapping potency of encapsulated and released mAb. Successful completion of these studies will lead to a Phase II proposal, with the goal of developing a shelf-stable capsule-IVR that slowly releases mAb against HIV, providing effective protection against vaginal HIV transmission with convenient once a month application. By enabling enhanced mAb function in mucus, we expect Mucommune will help pave the way for mAb-based potent protection against a broad array of pathogens at major mucosal surfaces."
"9452884","PROJECT SUMMARY Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis in older adults and affects nearly 15% of the world population, including 68% of Americans over the age of 55, at costs of over $100 billion annually. In addition to aging, the trauma of a sports or military injury can also cause osteoarthritis in younger adults. A wide range of drugs have been employed to relieve pain and alter the natural course of the disease, but due to the rapid clearance of the drugs by the synovial fluid, all of the drugs have half-lives only on the order of minutes and must be repeatedly administered in high dosages. These findings suggest that traditional drug administration protocols are inefficient for the treatment of OA, and that drug delivery approaches that can target the dense extracellular matrix of the OA joint could represent a cost-effective method for increasing drug efficacy. We propose a novel approach to this problem that will exploit interactions between collagen-like peptides and natural collagens to develop a new thermoresponsive paradigm for the treatment of OA. We will evaluate collagen-peptide-coated, hollow nanoparticles that can be assembled and disassembled at therapeutically relevant temperatures. The nanoparticles will be assembled and loaded with cargo via the interactions of thermoresponsive domains that are conjugated to collagen-like peptides, and the nanoparticles will be localized to remodeled collagen via strand exchange interactions that have been previously shown to be competent for nanoparticle immobilization to collagen films. We will employ a range of spectrometry, light scattering, and microscopy methods to analyze nanoparticle formation, cargo loading, and localization to collagen films and explants of human OA cartilage. We will also conduct a series of assays to characterize the retention, release, and immunocompatibility of the nanoparticles in an in vivo murine model of OA. Although the focus of the proposed work is on increasing the effectiveness of therapies for OA, it will also lay the foundation for more effective early diagnostic approaches for OA and the ability to target other diseases."
"9479606","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keloids result from an exaggerated response to wound healing of the skin. They grow beyond the original boundaries of the injury to the skin, causing cosmetic deformities, and there is no known treatment that consistently prevents their occurrence or recurrence. The existence of families in which multiple members are affected with keloids over several generations and that certain ethnic groups are more likely to develop keloids than others imply that certain genes may predispose people to keloid formation. Surprisingly, little is known about the genetic factors contributing to keloids in individuals of African or Hispanic ancestry, which are the two ethnic groups most likely to develop keloids. There is also little known about the differences between the normal skin of those who keloid and the normal skin of those that do not. The research aims of this application will test the hypothesis that specific genetic variations confer susceptibility to keloid formation in those individuals at greatest risk: subjects of African and Hispanic ancestry. They will also test the hypothesis that there exist uncharacterized genes and gene isoforms, in keloids as well as in the normal skin of individuals that keloid that are critical to keloid pathogenesis.  A keloid registry has been established to better characterize subjects and families of African and Hispanic descent with keloids. The registry has 117 families and 136 unrelated individuals with sporadic keloids to date and enrollment is ongoing. As part of enrollment a medical history, dermatologic evaluation and venipuncture are performed. Plasma and serum are aliquoted and genomic DNA is extracted and stored. In participants with a family history of keloids, the other family members (both affected and unaffected individuals) are invited to participate.  Specific Aim 1 is to Identify Susceptibility Loci in Families with Keloids. Linkage analysis will be performed on all of the members of a family with familial keloids. The location of disease-causing loci within each family will be found by identifying the genetic markers that are co-inherited with the keloid phenotype. A logarithm of the odds (LOD) score will be calculated based upon the genetic markers co-segregating with the keloid phenotype within the family. A LOD score of three or more will be used to determine if a region is linked with the keloid phenotype. Candidate genes within these identified loci will be examined to identify variants that co-segregate with keloid formation.  Specific Aim 2 is to Identify Genetic Variations Associated with Keloids. All exons in the genome (i.e. the exome) will be sequenced using high-throughput sequencing in selected members of families with keloids. Rare sequence variations identified in the affected family members will be further examined to identify variants that co-segregate with keloid formation. These candidate genes will be sequenced in other families that have a history of keloid formation as well as in unrelated individuals with sporadic keloids.  Specific Aim 3 is t determine the differences in gene expression between keloid skin and normal skin. This aim is two-fold in nature. Sub-Aim 3.1 is to determine the differences in gene expression between keloidal fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts, while Sub-Aim 3.2 is to determine the differences in gene expression between normal fibroblasts from keloid-prone individuals and normal fibroblasts from those that do not keloid. Primary fibroblasts will be isolated from keloid tissue obtained from surgical treatments. Primary fibroblasts from perilesional normal tissue from the same individual will also be obtained. Control primary fibroblasts will be obtained from age, sex and race-matched control individuals with no personal or family history of keloids. In both sub-aims, whole transcriptome sequencing will be performed on RNA from the primary fibroblasts and differences in gene expression between the different cells will be assessed. Findings will be confirmed with Northern blot analysis and/or real-time PCR.  These research aims will serve as the platform for my career development plan and will be coupled with training aims which include: 1) biostatistical analysis and methodology; 2) the analysis of high content/high complexity data sets; and 3) research management and manuscript/grant writing skills. These training aims will be achieved via didactic courses, experiential learning, and mentored studies.  Together, the research and training aims of the K23 proposal will provide the training, experience, and preliminary data for future R01 grant applications. This career development plan will prepare me to become a successful independent investigator and attain my long-term career goal of becoming a national leader in keloids and genetics."
"9617469","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) seeks renewal of its National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation awarded in 2009 via the P30 Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) mechanism. As South Carolina's leading academic medical center, MUSC is charged with building clinical, basic, translational, and population-based research programs that address the state's significant healthcare needs. The mission of the HCC is to reduce the cancer burden in South Carolina. To accomplish this mission, the Director, Dr. Andrew S. Kraft, and the HCC senior leadership have established a robust, interdisciplinary base that now includes 122 cancer scientists from 5 MUSC colleges and 20 academic departments.         Interdisciplinary, innovative research is driven through the organization of the HCC into four programs: Cancer Genes & Molecular Regulation, Cancer Immunology, Developmental Cancer Therapeutics, and Cancer Control. The rapid pace of discovery and movement toward effective translational research is supported by shared research resources, five of which are presented in this application: Lipidomics, Cell Evaluation & Therapy, Cell & Molecular Imaging, Biorepository & Tissue Analysis, and Biostatistics. The HCC also seeks CCSG support for its Clinical Trials Office which has spear-headed a dramatic 59% increase in accrual volume for interventional treatment trials over the last four years. Notably, 26% of patients enrolled onto interventional treatment trials in 2012 were minorities, representing a 45% increase in this project period. This has been promoted by HCC-led progressive outreach services and cancer education to South Carolinians, a largely rural population that includes some of the most medically underserved people in the US. Today, the HCC has $40.8M in annual total extramural research funding with $18.6M derived from the NCI, representing a 31% and 54% increase, respectively, since 2009. The HCC has successfully leveraged CCSG funding during the first project period and its NCI-designated Cancer Center status to continue the rapid growth of this Center. During the current project period, the HCC supported 34 strategic recruitments to the Center.

"9598060","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly malignancy with an overall 5-year survival rate of 6%. The molecular mechanisms that contribute to the biological aggressiveness of PDAC are being gradually elucidated, and the crucial role of high and low frequency driver mutations in PDAC is providing new insights into the complexity of this cancer. However, the widespread consequences of aberrant transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) actions in PDAC in the context of the presence of oncogenic Kras and loss of function of the retinoblastoma protein are not well understood. In this proposal we will use a novel genetically engineered mouse model (GEM) of PDAC that we generated in which oncogenic Kras is combined with RB deletion. The resultant KRC mice rapidly develop pancreatic intraepithelial (PanIN) lesions that progress to PDAC within weeks after birth, and the pancreatic cancer cells in these cancers are highly proliferative. Based on our published data and preliminary results, the KRC mouse will allow us to test the hypothesis that aberrant TGF-beta signaling in PDAC synergizes with RB inactivation, leading to deleterious actions by TGF-beta, aberrant mitogenic signaling, and enhanced pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and cancer cell-stroma interactions. We will evaluate the effects of RB loss of function on TGF-beta signaling, assess the role of TGF-beta signaling in PDAC metastasis, and delineate the contributions of inflammatory cytokines and Wnt pathways to pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and stroma formation. To this end we will use cell lines established from KRC pancreata, use other novel GEMs of PDAC generated in our laboratory that exhibit a high incidence of metastases, conduct therapeutic interventions in these GEMs, and assess the role of these pathways in human PDAC. The proposed studies will advance our understanding of PDAC pathobiology in a high impact manner, and will point the way to novel therapies for suppressing cancer growth and metastasis."
"9398647","At any time, nearly half of the 500,000 people in the United States living with multiple sclerosis (MS), a common and disabling neuro-inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, have a progressive course. Despite the explosion of new MS therapies, there remains a frustrating lack of disease-modifying therapies that can alter the functional decline of progressive MS (PMS) that resulting in reduced community participation, low quality of life, and high burdens on health care systems and caretakers. Lipoic acid (LA) is an inexpensive, endogenously-produced, oral antioxidant with multiple biological functions implicated in the pathogenesis of PMS. LA reduces disability in a dose- dependent fashion in the animal model of MS, and is safe and tolerated in people with MS. A 2- year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of daily oral LA in secondary progressive MS, a subset of PMS patients, demonstrated a remarkable 68% reduction in the annualized rate of whole brain atrophy, the current gold-standard MRI biomarker in PMS. While not powered to do so, the LA cohort exhibited a trend toward improvement in walking tests and a reduction in falls. This study proposes to expand on the highly promising preliminary results to confirm the effects of LA on reducing rates of brain atrophy and to determine its associated clinical benefits. The design is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oral daily LA in a PMS population with the following objectives:  1. Determine if LA is superior to placebo in maintaining a clinically meaningful outcome,  mobility, as measured by the primary outcome of change in completion time of the Timed  25 Foot Walk as suggested by the pilot study. Falls and other walking tests will be  evaluated to confirm the primary outcome results.  2. Determine if LA is superior to placebo in slowing whole brain atrophy with an estimated  40-50%% effect size. This will confirm our previous findings of a significant 68% reduction  in brain atrophy rate at a more modest effect size that is in line with protection of brain  atrophy rates from relapsing MS trials. Additional secondary outcome measures will  include neurological disability, cognition, mood, and quality of life.  3. Monitor safety and tolerability via laboratory testing and adverse event reporting. Participants at 3 or 4 sites with PMS will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to LA or placebo. Participants will be enrolled over 18 months and complete 7 study visits over 2 years. Walking tests will be performed at every visit. MRIs will be completed at baseline and study end. Secondary endpoints not related to MRI will be collected at study visits every 6 months. Safety labs will be collected at every study visit and adverse events every 3 months. The sample size of 50 per arm will allow for a 15% drop-out rate. The Portland VA Medical Center will be the lead coordinating site. Monthly conference calls and biannual site visits will assure uniformity and high quality of study data. A web-based database, centralized MRI reading center, and experienced data analysis center will be utilized. The results of this study, once confirmed, will set the stage for large-scale phase 3 clinical trials of LA for the treatment of PMS, filling a much needed gap in MS therapeutics, and resulting in improved health, safety, and quality of life for Veterans with MS."
"9454501","The brain initiates an exquisite process of repair after a stroke, involving rewiring of neuronal connections and reorganization of surviving tissue around the stroke. As with neurons, the vasculature also undergoes dramatic reorganization. Mechanisms such as angiogenesis are postulated to improve blood flow while co-existing mechanisms such as inflammatory cell adhesion and chronic constriction can impede flow. It is unknown how these mechanisms interplay to affect peri-infarct perfusion in the chronic stages of stroke, and how they might influence the remapping of brain function during recovery. Our long-term goal is to determine key factors that influence the rewiring and remapping of surviving neurons in peri-infarct areas, and to modulate them in a way that enhances the recovery process. The focus of this project, toward the achievement of this goal, is to understand how microvascular changes after stroke influence the plasticity of neuronal connections. As a model, we will create photothrombotic strokes in the mouse vibrissa system to mimic small, survivable strokes often seen in humans. Components of the neurovascular unit, including pre- and postsynaptic neuronal structures and microvessels, will be tracked dynamically over weeks of functional recovery using in vivo twophoton laser-scanning microscopy. We will use a novel thinned-skull cranial window that avoids the spurious effects of surgically induced inflammation, thus enabling the observation of brain remodeling in a natural intracranial environment. Our central hypothesis is that anomalies in microvascular blood flow can negatively influence neuronal rewiring in chronic stages of stroke. We further hypothesize that rehabilitative paradigms to enhance functional recovery alleviate microvascular dysfunction and improve neuronal remodeling. These hypotheses will be tested through three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to determine whether existing benchmarks of neuronal plasticity, i.e., dendritic spine and axon bouton number, are influenced by chronic, stroke-induced changes in microvascular density and perfusion. In Aims 2 and 3, we plan to determine how rehabilitative training by repetitive use and cortical electrical stimulation impacts these indices. We expect that this work will provide insight on the role of chronic microvascular changes in stroke recovery. It will further develop a novel imaging-based experimental framework for future mechanistic studies."

"9481687","ABSTRACT Childhood overweight and obesity (OW/OB) is a significant public health burden, affecting one third of U.S. children ages 6 through 19. Childhood OW/OB is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, including increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, which often persist into adulthood. Among this population, poor sleep health is also highly prevalent, and poor sleep health is suggested to be a putative risk factor for the development of OW/OB, especially among children. Previous studies examining the association between sleep and OW/OB risk have been limited by a singular focus on `usual' sleep duration as the sole indicator of an individual's sleep health. However, a growing number of studies have brought into question the importance of other sleep health dimensions, such as sleep schedule and quality, as well as the role of night- to-night variability in sleep health, which may impact OW/OB risk independent of sleep duration. This suggests that focusing on usual sleep duration alone may mask other critical dimensions of sleep health influencing OW/OB risk over time. Furthermore, although diet is a suggested behavioral pathway through which poor sleep may impact obesity risk, previous studies have largely failed to explore the impact of night-to-night variability in sleep on weight-related behaviors, such as dietary intake, occurring the following day. If findings support the proposed study hypotheses, the identification of variability in sleep health as a key factor influencing daily weight-related behaviors will increase our understanding of the role of sleep in OW/OB risk, and inform future prevention and intervention programs targeting obesity and its associated health problems in children. This project will leverage data from 200 children (ages 8-12 at baseline) enrolled in the NIH-funded Mothers' and their Children's Health (MATCH) Study, with EMA-assessed sleep and 24-hour recall-assessed dietary intake during week-long data collection waves, occurring bi-annually across three years (6 waves total). This study design allows for the elucidation of the temporal, short- and longer-term associations among sleep, diet, and OW/OB risk. Specifically, project analyses will use multilevel modeling and mixed effect location scale modeling to examine the short-term effects of sleep health on a given night with dietary intake the following day, as well as the cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of sleep and its variability on overall diet and obesity status and trajectories. This project also proposes a sleep sub-study in a sample (n=30) of MATCH children to determine the correspondence of wrist-worn accelerometer with EMA measures of daily sleep and to assist in data interpretation and cross-study comparisons."

"9645566","Project Summary The objective of the proposed research is to generate chemical tools that will expand our understanding of ADP­ribosylation in neuronal physiology. ADP­ribosylation was originally thought to be catalyzed by a single enzyme, ARTD1 (ADP­ribosyltransferases 1), but a family of 17 proteins is now recognized in humans that shares structural homology to the ARTD1 catalytic domain. ARTD1, and perhaps other ARTDs, play essential roles in cellular pathways in neurons that mediate long­term memory (LTM)? however, their roles in these processes are not well understood. Moreover, the direct protein targets of individual ARTDs in neurons are not known, hindering our ability to fully delineate the pathway from ARTD activation to LTM. Our current lack of understanding of the specific role of ARTD1, and other ARTDs, in neurons and in other cell types has been severely limited by the lack of inhibitors of individual family members and the inability to identify the direct targets for individual ARTDs in a cellular context. To overcome these limitations, this application describes, for the first time, the design and synthesis of (1) mono­selective inhibitors and (2) orthogonal NAD+ substrate analogs of ARTD1 mutants that are engineered to contain a unique pocket absent from wild­type ARTDs, but retain enzymatic activity. These orthogonal NAD+ analogs will be used for the identification of direct targets of ARTD1 in neurons. While initial studies will focus on the role of ARTD1 in neurons, we anticipate that our strategy can be generalized to other ARTDs, thereby potentially providing unprecedented insights into their roles in physiology and pathophysiology."
"9601192","A hallmark of fatal Ebola virus (EBOV) disease in humans is the induction of an excessive inflammatory response, as shown by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Multiple studies have shown that macrophages, which are early target cells of EBOV infection, are strongly activated when infected with EBOV. This activation is mediated by the surface protein of EBOV, glycoprotein GP, through TLR4. Since the TLR4 signaling pathway has evolved to mainly sense bacterial lipopolysaccharides, TLR4 activation early in EBOV infection could have devastating consequences because the resulting anti-bacterial immune response might hamper the development of an effective antiviral response. We have recently reported that GP of Reston virus (RESTV), which causes asymptomatic infections in humans, does not trigger a TLR4-mediated inflammatory response in human macrophages. Our data also show that treatment with TLR4 antagonists blocks the EBOV GP-mediated inflammatory response in human macrophages (Olejnik et al., 2017). This is in line with recent studies showing that treatment with TLR4 antagonists dampens the EBOV GP-mediated inflammatory response in mice and protects EBOV-infected mice from lethal infection (Lai et al., 2017; Younan et al., 2017). The goal of this R21 proposal is to begin to dissect the underlying mechanisms leading to TLR4 activation by EBOV GP and to identify TLR4 dependent and independent determinants of filovirus pathophysiology, potentially explaining the differences in pathogenicity seen between EBOV and RESTV. Our research team combines expertise in filoviral molecular virology, humanized mouse models to study filovirus disease, and high-resolution microscopy to determine EBOV GP-TLR4 interactions. In Aim 1, we will investigate if and how EBOV GP interacts with the TLR4 receptor complex to induce activation, and identify differences to RESTV GP. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of TLR4 activation on EBOV and RESTV replication. In Aim 3, we will use recently established immune-competent EBOV and RESTV mouse models that show morbidity and mortality to perform a comparative analysis of EBOV and RESTV pathogenesis. Importantly, we do not request funds for the animal work described in Aim 3."

"9475720","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Continued monitoring of malaria in pregnancy is lacking in most endemic settings, in spite of its significant disease burden. Increases in malaria-related harmful effects observed among Mozambican pregnant women after drastic malaria declines during the last decade [2] suggest that closely monitoring of the transmission is needed to quickly identify rebounds in adverse outcomes, especially in areas embarking in malaria elimination activities. Moreover, several evidences point to IgGs against VAR2CSA (the parasite antigen that mediates sequestration of P. falciparum in the placenta) as a marker of cumulative exposure to P. falciparum during pregnancy that can provide estimates of malaria transmission. We hypothesize that dynamics of malaria in pregnancy and pregnancy-specific immunity reflect changes in the intensity of transmission through location and time, not only among pregnant women but also in the underlying community. The goal of this study is to provide epidemiological, molecular and immunological insights of the value of pregnant women attending health facilities to generate estimates of malaria burden and its adverse consequences in situation of varying levels of malaria transmission, with the ultimate hope of developing new tools for the monitoring of malaria in endemic countries. To address this, we will conduct a three-year p study at three health facilities with different levels of malaria transmissin in Maputo Province to determine the relationship between malaria transmission, parasitological outcomes and the clinical impact of malaria infection in pregnant women at their first antenatal visit, delivery and during sick visits (Aim 1.1). Moreover, we will create a sample repository biobank for future investigations on host and parasite factors influencing malaria disease during pregnancy (Aim 1.2). We will also determine the relationship between malaria estimates obtained from pregnant women, children at hospital visits, (Aim 2.1) and seroprevalences against VAR2CSA (Aim 2.2). The impact of interrupting malaria transmission on pregnancy-specific serology (Aim 2.3) will be assessed in pregnant women from Magude after mass drug administration in the community. Finally, scientific capacity in the Manhiça Health Research Center (Aim 3) will be developed through training on a) epidemiological research and management of malaria data; b) molecular tools for detection of malaria parasites and molecular markers of antimalarial resistance for rapid mapping of drug resistance; and c) pregnancy- specific immunity as an innovative tool to assess malaria transmission. This study will contribute to promote a pregnancy malaria research agenda by improving our scientific knowledge on determinants of malaria susceptibility during pregnancy and demonstrating the feasibility and value of an easy-to-implement new generation serological tool for malaria surveillance in malaria elimination contexts."
"9519853","SUMMARY Chronic inflammation is associated with autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, and is responsible for high morbidity and mortality rates in western society. Consequently, developing effective strategies to prevent or inhibit inflammation is a highly significant objective that will profoundly impact human health care. Activation of vascular endothelial cells (EC) plays a crucial role in the pathology of chronic inflammatory diseases. Our long-term research goal is to identify the specific intracellular signals that underlie EC activation, as this will reveal targets for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or treating chronic inflammation. A major signaling mechanism associated with inflammation is activation of the NF-?B family of transcription factors. Two independent mechanisms of NF-?B signaling named the classical and non-canonical pathways have been described and each regulates discrete functions. For example, extensive studies have established key roles for classical NF-?B signaling in the pro-inflammatory function of EC and we recently defined a major function for EC-intrinsic classical NF-?B in arthritis. However, emerging evidence strongly supports a role for the non-canonical pathway during the development of chronic inflammation. Our published work and preliminary data has demonstrated that ligation of the lymphotoxin-? receptor (LT?R) activates the non-canonical NF-?B pathway in EC and upregulates expression of crucial pro-inflammatory and pro- angiogenic genes. To date however, no genetic models exist to directly study non-canonical NF-?B signaling in EC in vivo and there are no pharmacological approaches available to specifically target the non-canonical pathway. To address these significant roadblocks, we have developed a new in vivo mouse model conditionally lacking non-canonical NF-?B signaling in EC. In addition, we pioneered an innovative pharmacological approach to selectively target pathway-specific inhibitory polypeptides to activated EC in vivo. The goal of this proposal is to determine the precise function of non-canonical NF-?B signaling in EC and to test our overarching hypothesis that ?non-canonical NF-?B signaling regulates the pro-inflammatory function of endothelial cells?. Accordingly, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) To determine how endothelial cell-intrinsic non-canonical NF-?B signaling controls angiogenesis; (2) To define the role of endothelial cell-intrinsic non-canonical NF-?B signaling in arthritis; (3) To selectively pharmacologically inhibit non-canonical NF-?B activation in endothelial cells. These studies will for the first time directly address the effects of selectively abrogating non-canonical NF-?B signaling in EC on the pro-inflammatory function of this critical cell type. Accomplishing our aims will provide novel insight into the potential therapeutic value of targeting non-canonical NF-?B signaling in arthritis and other chronic inflammatory diseases. Consequently, our proposal is highly significant and broadly impacts a critical area of human health concern."
"9454496","The Clinical and Translational Tools and Resources Core (CTTR) is a new core designed to serve the clinical research needs of SCRCRS investigators. The Stroke Clinical Registry Database (CRD) - a powerful new research tool - is the centerpiece of the Core. In addition to containing information such as stroke type and disability status necessary to recruit subjects, the CRD also will become the home of all data produced when that subject participates in any research study, both the outcome measures extracted from the data sets collected and the complete data time series (e.g., neuromechanical data from behavioral measurements such as gait analyses, neurophysiological data from TMS protocols, and neuroimaging data from structural or functional MRI scans). Furthermore, the CRD will be a queriable secure research portal accessible to all SCRCRS investigators with vast capacity for data sharing. Through a robust interface with the South Carolina Clinical and Translational Research Institute (SCTR), the CTTR will perform four complementary roles that represent the core aims: (1) Recruitment and Retention - recruit a large population of well-characterized potential participants; (2) Biomedical Informatics - build a secure registry database that provides the ability to query the pool of participants based on specific characteristics and retrieve an extensive set of multidisciplinary measures in participants who match the search criteria; (3) Biostatistical Support - provide a strong biostatistical infrastructure to analyze and mine the rich dataset and support experimental design and data analysis; and (4) Mentoring - enhance the research skills of SCRCRS investigators to conduct highly translational, mechanism-based studies in stroke recovery research. COBRE funds will support the efforts of an internationally recognized clinician researcher in the stroke field who serves as Core Director; an expert in biomedical informatics who will oversee the informatics infrastructure; an expert in biostatistical methodologies and clinical trials development; and technical staff assistance. The SCTR Research Coordinator Core will facilitate research coordination and recruitment. The integration of multi-source data to be collected in the CRD with cutting-edge informatics tools and biostatistical analyses has the potential to pave the way for future stroke recovery research, first, by meeting crucial needs for a robust patient recruitment pipeline, methodologies and resources to search the prospective pool for appropriate candidates for each scientific study, and biostatistical expertise, and second, by becoming a unique research resource for MUSC, the State of South Carolina, and all members of the research and public communities with interest in stroke."
"9693955","PROJECT SUMMARY (Overall Center: Maier, Lantz)  The University of Arizona Superfund Research Program (UA SRP) is investigating the human and environmental risks associated with metal mining. A majority of metal mining takes place in the Western United States and other arid and semi-arid parts of the world. A central challenge for arid environments is that human exposure routes and the fate and cleanup of mining contamination are different than for areas that receive more rainfall. This has led to a large knowledge gap in regard to health and environmental effects of mine waste systems. Our Center will address two major issues within this overall gap. The first is the lack of understanding of mining waste behavior and containment and the relative impacts of airborne and waterborne spread of mine waste into arid environments. Mine wastes, in particular legacy mine tailings, generate dust- borne toxic metals (for example, arsenic and lead). These wastes also generate acid mine drainage, resulting in contamination of groundwater which is often the primary potable water source for surrounding communities. The second knowledge gap is a lack of understanding of the human health consequences of inhalation of mine dusts, specifically regarding the development of chronic lung diseases. The UA SRP has an unparalleled group of scientists to address these knowledge gaps. The three UA SRP environmental projects are focused on developing new technologies for site cleanup and on characterizing surface (dust) and subsurface (water) transport and fate of metals associated with mining waste both before and after cleanup. The two biomedical projects center around defining the importance of inhalation exposures and health impacts of metal toxicants in mine wastes, focusing on arsenic and its effects on lung disease. Results will be used to build conceptual and quantitative models to describe mechanisms of metal toxicity and movement from waste areas into neighboring communities or ecosystems. Together, our environmental and biomedical researchers will use these models to: 1) develop exposure assessment tools that can be used to evaluate the risk for communities that neighbor mine waste or smelter sites; 2) evaluate the effectiveness of new surface and subsurface cleanup technologies; and 3) provide critical information on how arsenic, one of the most prevalent toxicants in mine waste, exerts its effects. Project teams work seamlessly with Research Translation, Community Engagement, and Training Cores to support the dynamic translation of this research to communities adjacent to Superfund sites, federal (EPA, ATSDR) and state (AZ Dept. Environmental Quality, AZ Dept. Health Services) stakeholders, and the mining industry. To further its impact, the UA SRP will continue to develop complementary initiatives, such as the Center for Environmentally Sustainable Mining, an industry-academic cooperative to move research results into the field in real time. The principle guiding the UA SRP is that its research should be innovative in advancing individual scientific fields. More importantly, it should transform industry-wide practices in mining to improve environment/ecosystem preservation and protect human health."
"9586001","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The leukocyte integrin ?X?2 (CD11c/CD18) is an important cell adhesion protein in inflammatory responses of dendritic and myeloid cells. ?X?2 binds to a broad range of ligands through a canonical G-nucleotide-binding domain or inserted (?I)-domain when regulating immune cell migration from vasculature to the site of inflammation. The isolated ?I-domain crystal structures solved to date show that the ?I-domain allosterically changes shape and matures from the closed/low affinity to open/high affinity state (inside-out signaling). It has yet to be determined how the allosteric site and ligand-binding region of the ?I-domain couple and how small molecule antagonists inhibit ligand binding by disrupting allostery. These structural alterations of the ?I-domain on the cell surface have been theorized to control the intracellular recruitment of adaptors that link to signal transduction pathways and cytoskeleton rearrangements and ultimately regulate immune cell emigration when integrins bind ligands on the cell membrane. This proposal builds on previous progress in determining crystal structures of intact ectodomain ?X?2 and ?L?2 and elucidating the roles of secondary structural motions with functional assays. These structures showed that the ?I-domain on the intact integrin platform unprecedentedly undergoes a shape-shifting pathway of allosteric activation that differs from the laid-out ?I-domain activation mechanism but correlates well with the limited number of NMR and MD studies. We hypothesize that the ?I- domain samples into an ensemble of closed/low affinity state conformations and antagonist blocks ligand binding while stabilizing a limited ensemble of closed/low affinity conformations. An NMR strategy established in the laboratory will be employed to characterize in-solution dynamics of the ?I-domain and further analyze the molecular basis of how an antagonist decouples the ligand affinity and allostery."
"9509356","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psoriasis is a cutaneous autoimmune disease that affects approximately 2% of the population and has no cure. It is a cell-mediated disease in which NF-¿B-regulated cytokine expression and the IL-23/IL-17 axis are key susceptibility pathways involved in pathogenesis. Thus, therapeutics targeting these pathways would be highly advantageous. Naturally occurring electrophilic nitro-fatty acids, such as nitro-oleic acid (OA-NO2), are nitration products of unsaturated fatty acids that mediate anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cytoprotective reactions. The therapeutic potential of nitro-fatty acids has been demonstrated in several in vivo murine models of inflammatory disease. In this regard, OA-NO2 inhibits NF-?B signal transduction, thereby suppressing pro- inflammatory responses and distinguishing psoriasis as an excellent candidate for electrophilic nitro-fatty acid therapies. Ongoing studies demonstrate that subcutaneous (SC) injections of OA-NO2 inhibit and treat contact hypersensitivity (CHS) in a murine model. Thus, we hypothesize that targeting the skin immune system with electrophilic fatty acids will suppress cutaneous inflammatory processes central to psoriasis. The studies we propose will identify and distinguish the mechanisms involved in inducing the cutaneous anti- inflammatory immune response observed following SC injections of electrophilic fatty acids in inflammatory skin diseases. The goal of this preclinical proposal is to enable translational application of this new class of drugs for the treatment of psoriasis and other inflammatory skin diseases by examining the specific aims: Aim 1. Define the protective mechanisms induced by OA-NO2 in a murine model of ACD. Aim 2. Determine the anti-inflammatory effects of OA-NO2 on psoriasis. The conserved nature of electrophilic fatty acids supports the translational value of the preclinical studies we propose and provide an opportunity to utilize a unique and innovative approach by combing both human and murine inflammatory models, including the humanized mouse xenograft model and the K14-VEGF murine model. These studies will identify the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and protective effects of electrophilic fatty acids in the skin. They will reveal endogenous lipid signaling mechanisms in the skin and will improve our understanding of the function of electrophilic NO2-FA in skin immunity. Finally, these studies will inform the therapeutic development of electrophilic nitro-fatty acids for the treatment of skin diseases."

"9690999","Project summary    The nervous system and neurotransmitters can significantly effect the function of the immune system.  Recently, we have identified a novel CD4+ T-cell population that regulates innate immune function preventing mortality during septic shock. These unique T-cells exert regulatory function through production and release of the neurotransmitter of acetylcholine, inhibiting NF-?B dependent gene transcription in splenic macrophages. Release of this immuno-modulatory molecule is evoked by neurons that innervate the spleen, and release the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Originally proposed to originate in the celiac ganglia, the anatomic origin of this splenic innervation has become highly controversial.    The overall goals of this project are to refine the functional circuitry of communication between the nervous and immune systems. This will be achieved with mapping the origin of splenic sympathetic innervation using optogenetic stimulation of target ganglia with monitoring in target immune organs. Completion of these studies will yield important information in the basic immunological function of neuro-immune communication, providing a foundation for development of therapeutic devices."

Limited therapeutic options are available to combat VRE infections, and therefore substantial efforts have been invested in modifying vancomycin to produce new forms of the drug that can overcome these antibiotic-resistant pathogens. However, these efforts have met with limited success, in large part because we do not understand the molecular mechanisms of action that allow certain vancomycin variants to be active against VRE, while others are not.  In VRE, vancomycin resistance results from acquisition of a gene cluster encoding enzymes that remodel the bacterial cell wall. The remodeling alters the binding epitope for vancomycin, reducing the antibiotic's affinity for its target 1000-fold. Many investigators have modified vancomycin in bids to restore activity against VRE; commonly, efforts have centered around constructing dimeric or multivalent forms of the drug, with the expectation that they will be able to use avid binding to overcome low affinity and improve binding of the target. However, the results have been mixed, with some vancomycin dimers showing activity against VRE, while others do not, indicating that the avid binding model is inadequate to explain the functioning of these molecules. This lack of a mechanistic framework stymies rational development efforts and hampers one of the most promising avenues to new treatments for VRE infections.  To overcome this hurdle, we propose in our first aim a rigorous set of functional, mechanistic, and structural studies aimed at uncovering the mechanism(s) of action that confer anti-VRE activity on certain vancomycin dimers. We have chosen a representative panel of vancomycin dimers that have demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity with VRE strains, and will elucidate the contribution of avid binding to their activity, the structural basis of their target recognition, and whether other mechanisms contribute to their effects. In the second aim we propose a complementary approach, building upon emerging results that have demonstrated that ligands prompt vancomycin to assemble into a higher-order supercomplex. Following up on our structural characterization of this supercomplex, we have designed structure-based crosslinking strategies to stabilize supercomplex assembly, and will use them to test the effects of supercomplex formation upon target recognition and activity against VRE strains. The mechanistic insights provided by these experiments will enable future rational development of new therapeutics to combat VRE."
"9466456","Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography (PET) is a uniquely powerful medical molecular imaging modality for biological function imaging (e.g. blood flow, energy consumption or binding to cancer cell receptors). It utilizes radioactive molecular tracers that follow physiological processes in the body. A key component of a PET scanner is the block detector that provides location and timing information for every gamma ray detected within a certain energy band. Currently available commercial PET machines achieve a location accuracy of 3 ? 5 mm (in X and Y) and 300 ? 500 psec in time. LightSpin Technologies and the Brain Emission Tomography consortium proposed to develop a new block detector with a location accuracy of 1 mm (in X, Y, and Z) and 50 psec in time. In this SBIR project, LightSpin is proposing to develop a key component of the block detector, namely an innovative silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) array that will not only enable the system to achieve a 50 psec FWHM coincidence timing resolution, but will also integrate 100s of SiPMs on a single chip with integrated, low-power readout electronics providing a multiplexed digital output stream. The approach leverages the best features of custom analog SiPMs (low power, low noise, high quantum efficiency) with the best features of digital SiPMs (high timing efficiency, multiplexed digital output stream) to achieve a substantial improvement in performance, with an ultimate goal of achieving a single photon timing resolution below 50 ps FWHM while maintaining high QE and low power dissipation. The development of these new detector blocks is expected to enable new PET applications such as lightweight, portable brain PET scanners with higher imaging resolution at lower radiation dose for a wide range of applications."
"9488781","CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC) is committed to the translation of laboratory insights into routine clinical care. This requires a deep infrastructure to support the conduct of clinical trials of new interventions designed to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, and improve the long-term outcomes for cancer survivors. The Clinical Protocol and Data Management services of the Case CCC provide a centralized resource for the oversight and management of clinical trials from concept development through reporting of study results. Services include assistance with concept development and protocol writing; feasibility assessment; budgeting and contracting; research nursing and data management; database development and oversight; regulatory management including IND applications; interactions with sponsors; study registration; quality assurance; staff education; and reporting of results. Data and safety monitoring to ensure the integrity of data and patient safety is a critical centralized function. As our goal is to ensure access to clinical trials for all of our patients, special efforts are undertaken to provide the opportunity to participate in clinical trials regardless of sex/gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or age. The Specific Aims are to:  1) Provide a highly efficient and coordinated infrastructure to assist clinical investigators in the development,  conduct and reporting of clinical trials.  2) Oversee data integrity and ensure the safety of patients who participate in clinical trials.  3) Provide access to clinical trials for all cancer patients regardless of sex/gender, race, ethnicity, age, and  socioeconomic status, and proactively identify and address barriers to clinical trial participation among  patients, providers, research staff, and healthcare systems.  4) Support a robust portfolio of research studies relevant to children and address special considerations for  children with cancer to facilitate their participation in clinical trials. In 2016, 2,474 patients were enrolled onto Case CCC interventional trials (73 percent increase since 2012), including 866 patients on treatment studies. In 2016, thirty one percent of accruals to treatment studies and seventy percent of all interventional accrual was to investigator-initiated trials (peer-reviewed, institutional). There is a substantial commitment to support of National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) studies, with 209 patients accrued to treatment intervention studies in the third year of the NCTN. Furthermore, in 2016 the Case CCC enrolled and biopsied 93 patients on the NCI MATCH trial, supported by the Clinical Trials Units via rapid activation, centralized registration, and coordination of tissue acquisition and processing. !"
"9693564","Project Summary Four out of five youth in the juvenile justice system show evidence of being under the influence during their offenses, and over half test positive for substances at the time of their arrest. Further, 92% of arrested juveniles who tested positive for drugs tested positive for marijuana (National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, 2004). Although some treatment programs for juvenile offenders exist, most have focused on detained and incarcerated juveniles, who only represent one third of arrested youth (Puzzanchera et al., 2010). As a result, little is known about how to improve the continuum of care for the remaining two-thirds of this population, which consists of court involved but non-incarcerated youth (CINI). Court recommendations and referrals for CINI have mostly relied on outside community-based services, thus decreasing the likelihood CINI youth and their families will take the additional steps to seek intervention. Given that motivational interventions (MI) are brief, relatively easy to implement and have a greater reach than typical substance use treatment programs, researchers have recently directed their focus to interactive, computer-delivered MI protocols to further increase their reach as well as facilitate their implementation. Online interventions can be delivered at a lower cost, with less demand on staff time for training, and increased protocol fidelity, portability, and ease of use. While counselor-delivered MIs for adolescent substance use have been tested fairly widely, only a few studies have been published on the efficacy of computer-assisted MIs. Further, little research has focused on the efficacy of such interventions with marijuana using adolescents in general, and more specifically with CINI adolescents. In addition, combining such interventions for adolescents with brief parenting interventions is important but yet rarely implemented. Therefore, this application proposes to examine the feasibility and acceptability of integrating a computer-asssisted,, brief intervention protocol into the juvenile intake procedures at the Rhode Island Family Court (RIFC) for marijuana using adolescents and their parents. Following an open trial of the brief protocol, , 80 adolescents who screen positive for marijuana use at juvenile intake will be recruited from the RIFC and randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1) a computer-assisted adolescent MI plus an online parenting program ; or 2) usual care. Outcomes will be examined at 3 and 6-month follow-ups. This small trial will provide some initial evidence regarding utility of this protocol with CINI youth and whether a larger, fully powered trial is indicated in the future."
"9478569","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to improve the care of patients with Acute Lung Injury or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ALI/ARDS) by preventing or better treating ALI/ARDS. We will participate in development and execution of PETAL Network clinical trials. We will enhance the operations of the PETAL Network through unique intellectual expertise and resources that include a long history of participation in clinical trials of ALI/ARDS since 1974, application of Web-based versions of our replicable electronic clinical research and care protocols (eProtocols, detailed computer protocol clinician decision-support tools) that enable reproducible methods in clinical research, evaluation of long-term outcomes in survivors of ALI/ARDS, and investigations of platelets in the pathophysiology of ALI/ARDS. We will apply Web-based eProtocols based on best clinical practices for mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic and intravenous (IV) fluid support, and blood glucose management with IV insulin. The newer Web-based eProtocol versions will be easier to disseminate to multiple PETAL Network Clinical Centers, than earlier stand-alone bedside versions of eProtocols used in previous ARDS Network clinical trials. We also expect to develop new eProtocols to meet the needs of future PETAL Network clinical trials, thus increasing scientific rigor and result credibilty for the PETAL Network clinical studies. We propose a clinical trial to test whether combined antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and dipyridamole prevents ALI/ARDS. Advances in extracorporeal life support (ECLS, heart-lung machine support), since our participation in previous ECLS clinical trials, warrant re-evaluation of ALI/ARDS treatment with ECLS - the objective of our second proposed clinical trial. We will evaluate long-term outcomes in our two proposed clinical trials and we will support assessment of long-term outcomes in all PETAL Network studies. We will specifically: Enroll more than 40 subjects/year in PETAL Network clinical trials; Participate in PETAL Network activities and contribute intellectually; Propose two clinical trials that demonstrate our scientific capacities (Antiplatelet therapy for prevention and Extracorporeal life support for treatment of ARDS); Propose PETAL Network clinical trial sub-studies that help elucidate ALI/ARDS pathophysiology and evaluate long-term clinical outcomes; Provide computer protocols that enable reproducible clinical research methods (eProtocols); Plan and conduct long-term quality of life, neuropsychiatric, and functional outcome assessments; and Participate in preparation and delivery of PETAL Network reports, presentations, and manuscripts. Our proposed work to prevent ALI/ARDS and to enhance treatment of established ALI/ARDS will be relevant to the NIH mission of improving the health of patients."
"9478172","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        This application is a competing renewal application for a T35 summer medical student training program in environmental health sciences research that has been funded by NIEHS for 10 years. The 2 specific aims are: 1) To provide hands-on training in basic and clinical environmental health-based research to medical students in a structured mentored environment; and 2) To provide an interactive, educational experience that introduces medical students the fundamental skills necessary for basic, translational, and clinical environmental health-based research. A new feature (Distinction in Research Track) proposed will enhance training for the students to function as environmental health sciences specialists in an Academic Health Center setting. The program has supported the training of 6 second year-medical students each summer in environmental health sciences research topics, including environmental cardiology, environmental metabolic disease, and environmental pulmonary disease, with a particular focus on diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity and hormonal regulation of metabolism. Trainees can choose from research projects submitted by 23 mentors in the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry, and Public Health (ranking them 1-5 for interest) and are selected from the top half of the first year medical class at UofL for appointment to the T35 Training grant.  A successful effort has been made to recruit students from ethnic minorities and disadvantaged backgrounds. During the 11-week summer training, students work with mentors on their research project in clinical or laboratory settings and complete training in the Responsible Conduct of Research (including topics on fabrication and falsification of data, plagiarism, managing scientific data, publication practices and responsible authorship, mentorship, stewardship, and conflict of interest). Trainees working with human subjects complete human subject and IRB training prior to beginning their research. Likewise, trainees who will use vertebrate animals in their research are required to complete a training course for animal research. All trainees will attend a weekly Environmental Health Sciences Conference designed to introduce clinical and translational research in environmental health sciences to T35 trainees. The conference culminates with each Trainee presenting his/her research project to peers and mentors. Trainees also present the results of their research as posters with peers at a School of Medicine week-long celebration of research that includes nationally recognized physician scientists as keynote speakers. Training in the NIEHS T35 program will encourage students to participate in the new Distinction in Research (DIR) Track in the Medical School for a continued longitudinal research experience in years 2-4 of medical training which allows them to develop research-oriented skills and to complete a translational research project in the third/fourth years. Publication of peer-reviewed articles, as some have achieved, will serve as outcomes of DIR training, as well as the strength of residency training and first/future permanent positions."
"9475177","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The ?4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is pathologically defined by the presence of amyloid-? (A?)-containing plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. APOE4 is also a major genetic risk factor for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a common pathological feature of AD with amyloid deposits along the cerebrovasculature. Our long-term goal is to understand how APOE4 differs from APOE3 and APOE2 in regulating A? metabolism and the formation of amyloid plaques and CAA, thereby increasing risk for AD and CAA. As apoE is expressed abundantly both in brain parenchyma by astrocytes and in the cerebrovasculature by vascular mural cells, which include smooth muscle cells and pericytes, it is critical to examine how apoE isoforms expressed in different domains of the brain regulate apoE-related biology and pathobiology. As such, we have generated inducible and cell-type specific mouse models that express human apoE3 or apoE4 with the major goal being to test the specific roles of apoE isoforms produced by astrocytes or vascular mural cells in BBB permeability, brain A? clearance and the formation of amyloid plaques and CAA. We hypothesize that human apoE4 expressed both in astrocytes and vascular mural cells contributes to compromised BBB integrity, impaired brain A? clearance and the formation of amyloid plaques and CAA. We propose three complementary aims to test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we plan to compare how apoE isoforms produced by astrocytes or vascular mural cells differ in their biochemical properties and functions in regulating receptor binding, lipid transport, BBB integrity and A? cellular uptake. In Aim 2, we plan to examine how expression of apoE3 or apoE4 in astrocytes or vascular mural cells affects BBB integrity, brain A? clearance, amyloid plaque deposition, and the formation of CAA in vivo using our recently developed mouse models that allow for inducible and cell-type specific expression of human apoE3 or apoE4. Finally in Aim 3, we will analyze how apoE isoforms and their expression levels influence the severity and topographical distribution of CAA in humans using a large collection of autopsy brains available through the Mayo Clinic ADRC Neuropathology Core. Together, our studies using cellular and animal models, as well as human autopsy brain tissue, will allow us to elucidate how apoE isoforms expressed in brain parenchyma and in cerebrovasculature regulate brain A? clearance and the formation of amyloid plaques and CAA. These studies also have the potential to generate novel insights into how we can design therapeutic strategies for AD and CAA by targeting apoE."
"9480535","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Passive immunization with broadly-neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV-1 offer promise for prevention and even treatment of HIV-1 infection. With the advent of new technologies in recent years, numerous ?broadly neutralizing? antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV-1 have been isolated. While bnAbs appear to be escaped and have little impact on controlling infection in their originating hosts, they have shown promise given as passive immunization, controlling viral replication in infected persons. Bi-specific bnAbs have been shown to be a method to combine bnAbs for synergy. Hybrid bnAbs have been produced by pairing the heavy and light chain of one bnAb with those of another. Proof-of-concept has shown that these can be synergistic combinations of bnAbs. A downside, however, is that these molecules have only a single binding site of each specificity. We propose to utilize a different approach to create bi-specific antibodies. Quadri-valent antibodies can be produced by adding single chain antibody domains to the end of the heavy chain of another antibody. This produces two binding sites for each specificity. Additionally, it allows greater flexibility between the two binding specificities. In this project, we will apply this technology to producing novel quadri-valent chimeric bnAbs. We hypothesize that the additional binding sites and greater flexibility will allow more opportunities for synergy. Specifically, we plan:  · Aim 1: To create a panel of quadri-valent bi-specific bnAb constructs with modifications that  further enhance inter-binding site flexibility, and  · Aim 2: To test promising constructs for potency and breadth of antiviral activity against HIV-1."
"9478548","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The use of anti-resorptives to treat osteoporosis has limitations due in part to their inability to maintain bone formation and bone turnover. It is believed that turnover suppression is contributing significantly to side effects such as osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical fractures of the femur. In this context, the search for novel means to increase bone mass and prevent fragility fractures has become of the utmost importance. PTH, the only approved anabolic drug on the market, increases efficiently bone formation but also increases bone resorption and has been associated with osteosarcoma in animal studies, limiting its long-term use. The discovery that activating canonical Wnt (C-Wnt) signaling mutations in humans and mice lead to strong anabolic responses and increase bone mass and strength raised significant hope to resolve this unmet medical need. Although several compounds that activate Wnt signaling are currently in clinical trials, such as antibodies to sclerostin or Dkk1, recent clinical findings have shown a time-limited bone formation effect, raising multiple questions about their therapeutic use and illustrating the fact that our understanding of Wnt signaling in bone remains limited. We propose here to test in mice the hypothesis that inhibiting Rspo3 in the adult skeleton may be a novel anabolic approach to osteoporosis. The investigations in this proposal will elucidate the effects of deleting Rspo3 in postnatal bone homeostasis, the effects of antagonizing Rspo3 in the adult skeleton and in a model of osteoporosis and the mechanism(s) by which bone mass is increased. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim 1: Further analyze the effects of Rspo3 deletion on bone homeostasis in vivo and on bone cells in vitro and evaluate the effect of inducible OB-targeted deletion (Col1a1-CreERT2  /Rspo3f/f) of Rspo3 in the adult skeleton. Specific Aim 2: Explore in vitro and in vivo the molecular mechanisms by which deletion of Rspo3 increases ?-catenin stabilization and thereby Wnt signaling. Specific Aim3: In parallel, establish a model of therapeutic intervention in osteoporosis by generating an inducible global Rspo3 knockout (R26ERCre/Rspo3f/f) to test the effects of Rspo3 reduction/deletion in the adult skeleton and after ovariectomy. The studies proposed in this application are innovative since our data reveal a novel and unexpected role of RSpondins in bone homeostasis, and significant because they demonstrate that reduction in the levels of RSpondins can induce a strong anabolic response in rodents, unexpectedly making this family of soluble Wnt regulators a potential target for therapeutic intervention. They also ar directly translational since testing the effects of reduction of RSPO3 expression in an adult skeleton and after OVX may have a significant impact on the treatment of osteoporosis, and other diseases of bone fragility."
"9669159","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of chemotherapy for the treatment of childhood leukemia more than sixty years ago, the, prognosis for children with cancer has improved dramatically. The 5-year survival rate for childhood cancers, many of which were uniformly fatal in the pre-chemotherapy era, is now approaching.80%. Despite these advances, several childhood cancers still have unacceptably low cure rates, and even when treatment is successful, the acute and long-term morbidity of current therapy can be substantial. The Children's Oncology Group (COG), the world's largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research, was founded 12 years ago. The COG's multidisciplinary research team, comprised of more than 8,000 members, conducts research at more than 200 leading children's hospitals, universities, and cancer centers. This proposal is for COG, as part of NCI's new National Clinical Trials Network, to continue its collaborative research work that supports the mission of improving the outcome for all children with cancer. The COG will design and conduct clinical-translational studies for children with cancer that builds on an increasing understanding of the molecular basis for pediatric malignancies and has the highest potential to improve the outcome. Using innovative clinical trial designs suitable for the study of rare diseases, we will study novel therapeutic approaches that range from targeted, small molecules to cellular therapies. As more than 90% of children diagnosed with cancer in the US are treated at COG member institutions, the COG has the ability to offer to children with cancer and their families to participation in research that allows for collection and annotation of biospecimens from all children with cancer, providing the foundation for discovery and accelerating the most promising research efforts conducted in laboratories around the world. The COG research portfolio importantly also includes research trials focused on improving the quality of life children with cancer and survivors. The proposal is for support of the COG Group Operations Center, clinician-scientists who develop and conduct research, and for member sites to participate through enrollment of eligible subjects."
"9681522","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overarching theme of this Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science is the development of improved models to inform tobacco product regulatory strategies that integrate 1) economic impacts of tobacco use on health costs, 2) risk perceptions, perceived acceptability, consumer responses to pro-tobacco marketing and anti-tobacco messages and other social determinants of tobacco use, and 3) rapid changes in risk due to tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure as manifested in cardiovascular and pulmonary dysfunction. This TCORS includes five full projects (one on economic models, two on behavioral models, and two on cardiovascular and pulmonary disease models), two developmental projects (one on behavioral models and one on cardiovascular and pulmonary disease models), three Cores (Administrative, Informatics and Analysis, and Biomarker), a postdoctoral training program and a process for selecting future developmental projects. The results will inform FDA regulation of the manufacture, distribution and marketing of tobacco products by providing an improved scientific framework in which to evaluate the likely effects of specific regulatory strategies by developing 1) improved economic models for analysis of proposed regulations that account for short-term as well as long-term effects of tobacco use, 2) better understanding of behavioral and social determinants of tobacco use (including perception of risk and decision making processes) to inform the economic models, regulation of marketing, and public education about risks of tobacco products, and 3) functional biomarkers of acute cardiopulmonary responses to tobacco use and secondhand smoke that may predict future disease and also support development of improved economic models. In particular, these improved economic models will integrate the rapid changes in risk due to reductions in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases which would be expected to result from FDA regulatory decisions. This TCORS is built on the UCSF Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education's tradition of strong transdisciplinary and collaborative research, education and service.           RELEVANCE: This TCORS will inform FDA regulation by developing new economic models that account for short-term and long-term effects of tobacco use, developing a better understanding of behavioral determinants of tobacco use, and identifying functional biomarkers of acute cardiopulmonary responses to tobacco use that could be used in premarket testing of tobacco products."
"9458695","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteocytes are critical to the maintenance of tissue quality and mechanical integrity of bone. As the primary mechanosensing cells, osteocytes orchestrate bone's adaptation processes under mechanical cues such as load-induced fluid flow. However, the in vivo mechanisms by which osteocytes, deeply embedded in mineralized matrix, detect and transduce mechanical signals remain elusive. Filling this knowledge gap is essential to the development of new osteoporosis treatments that exploit bone's intrinsic sensitivity to mechanical loading (a potent anabolic factor). Recent studies have found a fibrous pericellular matrix (PCM) that spans the entire fluid annulus (~80nm) within the lacunar-canalicular system (LCS) and tethers the cell processes to the canalicular wall matrix. Evidence increasingly suggests that these PCM tethering fibers act as mechanical sensors, capturing fluid drag force and initiating mechanotransduction cascades in osteocytes. However, rigorous testing of this concept has been hindered by a lack of quantitative tools for measuring the PCM ultrastructure and by the scarcity of data regarding PCM composition. Breakthroughs from our previous award cycle have overcome these barriers, allowing us to precisely define the functional roles of the PCM in bone. First, we invented a tracer velocimetry approach based on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to quantify osteocytic PCM in intact bone. Second, we identified perlecan/HSPG2, a large heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan, to be an essential structural component of the PCM. Using a perlecan-deficient mouse model that mimics human Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS) we discovered that perlecan deficiency results in not only decreased PCM fiber density but also attenuated responses to in vivo loading and unloading. These preliminary studies formed the cornerstone of our hypothesis that the osteocytic PCM regulates bone's adaptation to mechanical cues through mechanosensing in the LCS, which will be tested at the tissue, cellular, and molecular levels in the following three specific aims: 1) Quantify the effects of PCM alterations on bone adaptation to mechanical cues in vivo; 2) Quantify the effects of PCM alterations on osteocyte mechanosensing ex vivo; 3) Determine the mechanisms by which PCM perlecan forms functional mechanosensing tethers in the LCS in vitro. The proposed studies are important because PCM is the critical interface between osteocytes and the extracellular environment. Identifying the functional roles of the osteocytic PCM and one of its major components, perlecan, in bone adaptation could lead to the development of new osteoporosis treatments that exploit bone's intrinsic sensitivity to mechanical stimuli, a potent non- pharmaceutical factor in promoting bone formation. These studies will also advance our knowledge of the fundamental functions of the PCM, a uniquely functioning but overlooked structure found in nearly all mammalian cells including osteocytes."
"9511744","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Through studies proposed here, we will develop a strategy for antigen-specific negative immunization to prevent and treat contact dermatitis. Further, the studies proposed will establish a model approach that could be extended for the development of therapies to prevent or treat a broad range of T-cell mediated inflammatory skin diseases. We propose to manipulate neuroinflammatory responses in the skin at the moment of antigen challenge to prevent the development of antigen-specific T-cell responses including prevention of the development of T-cell memory. Further, we will extend this strategy to mitigate/abrogate established memory T-cell responses that underlie chronic inflammatory skin diseases. To accomplish this we will utilize novel microneedle array (MNA) technology developed in our laboratory. These MNAs have been formulated to achieve simultaneous delivery of antigen (Ag) and neuroimmunomodulatory small molecules to a specific skin stratus. By combining this innovative immune-regulatory approach with our novel MNA delivery technology, we will engineer the cutaneous microenvironment in vivo. The purpose of our approach is to generate Ag specific anti-inflammatory antigen presenting cells (APCs) capable of presenting Ag to T cells in a tolerogenic fashion. This strategy will enable, for the first time an Ag-specific therapy for the prevention and treatment of T-cell mediated skin diseases. We will evaluate the effects of this strategy on the prevention of Ag-specific effector and memory T-cells (Aim 1), and the mitigation/abrogation of preexisting memory responses (Aim 2). We will determine mechanisms that prevent immune induction, including effects on skin APC function, and memory T-cell induction, function, and survival. Importantly, our experiments include translational studies focusing on human skin (Aims 1 and 2) that are specifically designed to enable rapid translation of this strategy to clinical trials."
"9652331","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to byproducts of industrial combustion, such as dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), causes multi-organ phenotypes including cardiotoxicity. Understanding the signaling pathways by which such compounds cause toxicity is crucial for predicting acceptable exposure levels and for reversing the effects of adverse exposure. Dioxins and PAHs activate aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AHR), ligand-dependent transcription factors that recruit cofactors to DNA and directly regulate gene expression. However, our knowledge of AHR cofactor recruitment and regulation is limited. The goal of this application is to identify the transcriptional cofactors by which AHR mediates cardiotoxicity and test the hypothesis that AHR ligands modulate cofactor recruitment. Structurally distinct AHR ligands induce differential transcriptional responses, suggesting that different ligands bind AHR and recruit different cofactors, leading to differential gene expression Consistent with this hypothesis, our preliminary data in zebrafish embryos, an established model of dioxin and PAH toxicity, indicates that AHR-mediated cardiotoxicity is ligand dependent. Acute exposure to the AHR ligand 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), but not the AHR ligands 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) or benzo (a) pyrene (BaP), caused cardiac edema and heart malformation. While the idea of ligand-dependent cofactor recruitment has been established for the estrogen receptor family of transcription factors, whether AHRs act in a similar manner is less well understood. Approximately 20 AHR cofactors have been identified, yet aside from the ARNT protein, it is not known which cofactors are required for cardiotoxicity or whether cofactors are recruited in a ligand-dependent manner. We propose that TCDD-AHR recruits a different complex of transcriptional cofactors than either 3MC-AHR or BaP-AHR and that differential cofactor recruitment underlies ligand-dependent gene expression and cardiotoxicity. In Aim 1 we will identify AHR cofactors required for TCDD-dependent cardiotoxicity. Using genetic approaches, we will test whether candidate cofactors are required for TCDD cardiotoxicity. We will also use unbiased biochemical and proteomic approaches to purify TCDD-AHR from the developing heart and identify interacting proteins. In Aim 2 we will identify ligand-dependent AHR cofactors from whole embryos and select tissues. Using zebrafish `knock-in' strains with epitope tags inserted into endogenous AHR signaling genes, we will test whether known cofactors differentially interact with endogenous AHR depending on the AHR ligand. We will also purify AHR from zebrafish embryos and use mass spectrometry to identify cofactors bound to AHR following exposure to TCDD, 3MC or BaP. Results from this application will identify a mechanism of TCDD cardiotoxicity and will provide a foundation for elucidating how the structure of AHR changes in response to differential ligand binding. Furthermore, our results will increase our understanding of the role of cofactors in endogenous AHR signaling, which may lead to improved treatment for diseases where AHR signaling is abnormal."
"9456096","Project Summary Every year, a substantial number of children injure a growth plate, a cartilaginous region found at the end of all long bones in children that provides signals for the bones to lengthen. The growth plate is the most fragile structure in a child?s developing bones, making it prone to injury. Damaged cartilage within the growth plate is often replaced by unwanted bone, forming a ?bony bar?, which can lead to angular deformities or halt bone growth completely. Current surgical methods to correct bone growth defects are invasive, prone to infections and have low success rates. There is no current treatment that leads to complete repair of an injured growth plate. Innovative treatment strategies that prevent bony bar formation, restore functional growth plate cartilage, and permit normal longitudinal bone growth in affected individuals are greatly needed. This proposal seeks to develop an injectable hydrogel biomaterial system that could prevent bony bar formation and promote the formation of cartilage tissue, and which could ultimately be examined for its ability to heal growth plate injuries in children. It has been shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) infiltrate the injured growth plate and undergo osteogenic differentiation. Here, two important areas for inhibiting the osteogenesis of MSCs via a biomaterial system will be studied: (1) the role of biopolymer hydrogel substrate mechanics in preventing osteogenesis, and (2) the delivery of short interfering RNA (siRNA) from biopolymer hydrogels that can block osteogenic differentiation. We hypothesize that hydrogel systems that are less stiff and that provide sustained exposure of MSCs to p38 MAPK siRNA will inhibit osteogenesis. This proposal seeks to engineer hydrogel systems with these characteristics as a first step towards creating new technologies for helping to heal growth plate injuries in children. This will be accomplished as by two Aims: Aim 1 - To engineer a hydrogel system with mechanical cues that prevent osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Aim 2 - To design a hydrogel that would provide sustained release of siRNA targeting p38 MAPK to prevent osteogenesis of MSCs. The p38 MAPK pathway has been linked to osteogenesis in various cell types, including MSCs. Local inhibition of this pathway by siRNA could prevent MSC osteogenesis from occurring after growth plate injury. For both Aims, these studies will be conducted in vitro and also in vivo in a rat growth plate injury model. This project is a first step towards successful development of a biomaterial system that can prevent MSC osteogenesis, which could ultimately aid in growth plate tissue repair."
"9526852","PROJECT SUMMARY Pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients have a 5-year overall survival rate of less than 10%, unless these patients can undergo curative surgery. Patients who will undergo surgery first receive chemotherapy treatment to improve the likelihood of success of the surgery. However, the vast majority of patients are not surgical candidates due to disease dissemination, and are therefore treated with only a combination of multiple chemotherapies. For these patients as well as those who are candidates for surgery, improved chemotherapy efficacy would likely significantly improve survival rates. One way to improve chemotherapy efficacy is to increase delivery of chemotherapy specifically to the tumor by improving tumor vascular function. We have demonstrated in mouse models of pancreatic cancer that moderate aerobic exercise causes tumor vasculature to remodel and become more functional, leading to better chemotherapy delivery to the tumor and ultimately better anti-tumor efficacy. We also demonstrated that tumor vascular normalization in response to exercise is dependent on increased Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) in the serum. Importantly, our pilot study in human patients with pancreatic cancer patients demonstrated that a home-based aerobic and resistance exercise program is safe and feasible during the time after diagnosis, during chemotherapy, chemoradiation, and rest, prior to surgery. Here, we propose to evaluate tumor vascular remodeling and serum levels of TSP-1 to determine whether these are biomarkers of response to exercise, which we hypothesize will correlate with improved chemotherapy efficacy and thus better patient outcome. Patient outcome will include physical fitness and strength, as well as the percent of surgical candidates who are able to undergo surgery. We will evaluate blood and surgical tumor specimens, as well as patient outcomes, from patients in a randomized clinical trial comparing standard of care (recommendation to exercise) to a home-based, structured exercise program consisting of 150 minutes per week of walking and resistance exercise during the time that patients are actively receiving chemotherapy, chemoraidation, or are recovering prior to surgery."
"9468346","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While abundant sarcomeric actin isoforms are famous for their essential role in striated muscle contraction, low abundance non-muscle cytoplasmic actin isoforms (?cyto- and ?cyto-actin) are also emerging as important in the maintenance of specialized structures in normal and diseased skeletal muscle. During this project, we generated and characterized muscle-specific mouse lines lacking either ?cyto-actin, or ?cyto-actin, or overexpressing ?cyto-actin to understand their endogenous functions and role(s) in dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy. Interestingly, each ?cyto-actin or ?cyto-acin single knockout develops a qualitatively similar phenotype characterized by a progressive myopathy with significant myofiber degeneration/regeneration and muscle weakness. We have shown that 2000-fold muscle-specific overexpression of ?cyto-actin in dystrophin- deficient mdx mice affords significant protection from eccentric contraction-induced force drop. Our new data suggest that eccentric contraction drives a rapidly-reversible, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated inhibition of sarcomeric contractility that may function to protect dystrophic muscles from myofibrillar damage caused by repeated, high force contractions. Finally, we have obtained new data suggesting that ?cyto- and ?cyto-actins collaborate to maintain the functional interaction between mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum. Going forward, we will make use of our unique animal models, isoform-specific reagents and biochemical and physiological methodologies to address fundamental questions about cytoplasmic actins in normal skeletal muscle function and in dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy. In aim 1, we will investigate how loss of a key redox buffering protein contributes to eccentric contraction-induced force drop in dystrophic mdx skeletal muscle. In aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that stretch-induced ROS may cause eccentric contraction induced force drop in mdx muscle via reversible oxidative modification of sarcomeric actin or other myofibrillar proteins critical for contractile function. n aim 3, the roles of ?cyto- and ?cyto-actins at the interface between mitochondria and the sarcoplasmic reticulum will be investigated through characterization of mouse lines in which ?cyto-actin and ?cyto-actins have been knocked out in skeletal muscle individually, or in combination. The results of the proposed studies will definitively address the unique and important contributions of cytoplasmic actin isoforms to the function of normal and diseased skeletal muscle."
"9398714","Background: Patients undergo millions of noninvasive diagnostic imaging tests, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine, in the United States annually. Based on Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) developed by professional medical societies, 20-30% of these tests may be inappropriate, i.e., the potential benefit-to-risk ratio is not maximized. Limited data on appropriateness of imaging within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) suggests that inappropriate use is similar to that outside the VHA. A variety of methods have been employed to encourage more appropriate use of noninvasive imaging. One of the most popular is an electronic decision support tool (DST). These software products are added to patient care workflows to capture meaningful AUC data and reduce unnecessary testing. A recent VHA Evidence Synthesis Program (ESP) report concluded that little is known about the implementation of DSTs and possible negative ramifications of their use. Further, the cost to the VHA of noninvasive imaging testing, which has not been calculated, is needed to determine the burden of inappropriate tests. Specific Aims: In the course of this award, we will achieve the following specific aims: (1) assess potential barriers and facilitators to successful adoption of a DST, (2) determine the effectiveness of a DST using a stepped implementation process, and (3) estimate the fiscal effectiveness of a DST in the VA health system by developing a micro-costing model for delivery of noninvasive imaging tests. Significance: Through these investigations, we will glean valuable insight into how to adjust processes to improve the ordering of millions of costly tests. If effective at reducing unnecessary tests, the results from this proposal will ultimately improve Veterans' access to care and reduce radiation risks. Innovation: Study of DSTs has focused primarily on effectiveness, with little attention paid to the implementation process and possible adverse effects such as provider dissatisfaction and inefficiency. Our investigations will break new ground in studying these aspects of DSTs. The use of qualitative and micro- costing methods as we propose is innovative given their underuse for clinically oriented research. Methods: We will apply the Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to the specific aims for this award. In Specific Aim 1, we will use qualitative and quantitative methods to identify possible barriers and facilitators to DST implementation through interviews and surveys of providers who order noninvasive tests. In Specific Aim 2, implementation of a DST for noninvasive imaging will be assessed from the rate of testing, the proportion of testing that is inappropriate, and feedback from providers in three discrete steps. First, providers blinded to AUC for imaging tests will order tests as usual. Second, at the point of ordering, they will receive immediate feedback on appropriateness of the test and be given the option to change the order. Third, if the provider's decision is not consistent with AUC, the provider will be required to give a justification for the test order. These steps will help us understand the implementation process for DSTs and to address gaps in the literature raised by the recent ESP. In Specific Aim 3, the cost of noninvasive imaging tests will be calculated using information from administrative databases, time-and-motion observation of care delivery, and cost diaries from Veterans. Expected Results: We anticipate that through these investigations, we will learn and be able to share important lessons about implementation of a DST for noninvasive imaging. The results will be the basis for investigator initiated research grants on further spread of DSTs within the VA system and adaptation to other imaging/testing modalities such as echocardiography."
"9455677","Project summary The objective of this study is to define associations between gut microbiota, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and obesity in populations spanning the epidemiologic transition, and explore mechanisms by which these factors may independently and collectively influence the development of obesity. The gut microbiota and SCFAs have been associated with obesity, yet the causal mechanisms are unknown, as are the individual obesogenic effects of the individual SCFAs (butyrate, acetate and propionate). Existing studies are, limited by contradictory findings, small sample sizes, limited and imprecise measurements of obesity, and lack of detailed dietary and other environmental exposures/mediators. We propose to overcome these challenges by leveraging an existing cohort of five diverse, well-defined populations from the Modeling the Epidemiologic Transition Study (METS, R01-DK080763). METS is comprised of a cohort of 2,500 African-origin adults, living in 5 distinctly different environments; Ghana, South Africa, Jamaica, the Seychelles and the US, and who have been prospectively followed since 2010. Our preliminary data suggest that while gut microbiota and SCFAs differences exist across sites, similar relationships exist across the sites for gut microbiota/SCFAs adiposity effects. In addition to yearly health measurements; we propose to measure gut microbiota and stool SCFAs in all participants (2500) during the first year of the current study, thus providing one of the largest gut microbiota population-based studies to date. We will divide our cohort of 2500 individuals into 2 sets: (1) a test set of 1000 individuals to explore which gut microorganisms and stool SCFAs are associated with adiposity; (2) a validation set of 1500 individuals to independently verify the biomarkers identified in the test set, thus minimizing spurious correlations due to large number of features (e.g., bacterial taxa). We will follow all 2500 individuals for 3 years to assess weight and adiposity changes, using Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression modeling to explore whether changes can be predicted by gut microbiota and SCFAs factors. Finally, using a causal mediation analysis, we will identify the direct and indirect effect of single and/or cumulative gut microbiota on adiposity as mediated by SCFA. We will thus capitalize upon an existing, extensively well described cohort of adults of African-origin, with significant variability as a result of the widespread geographic distributions, and therefore variation in the environmental covariate exposures. The proposed study will substantially advance the understanding of the role gut microbiota and SCFAs play in the development of obesity and provide novel obesity therapeutic targets targeting SCFAs producing features of the gut microbiota."
"9540456","Project Summary/Abstract  The final step of cell division is the physical separation of daughter cells by cytokinesis. This process is crucial for growth of all organisms from bacteria to humans. The cell cycle and cytokinesis must but must be properly regulated to enable growth and development as well as to prevent division errors. Cytokinetic failure leads to aberrant ploidy increases, which are thought to contribute to tumorigenesis. Decades of research have been spent elucidating the mechanisms governing this essential process; however, many aspects of its regulation remain poorly understood. Multiple lines of evidence suggest the existence of a ring checkpoint governing constriction of the conserved contractile ring during cytokinesis.  I will use the model yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to identify proteins involved in each component of the constriction checkpoint and determine how their interactions regulate actomyosin ring constriction. The components of this checkpoint and the mechanisms by which they interact with and regulate the contractile ring and the enzymes synthesizing the cell wall remain unknown. The conservation of this process suggests that proteins and mechanisms are likely similar to cytokinetic regulation in animal cells, in which interactions with the extracellular matrix and neighboring cells providing analogous inputs to the cell wall in fission yeast. In the proposed work, I will identify the components and elucidate the mechanisms that trigger constriction and septum ingression upon checkpoint satisfaction (Aim 1), put a brake on constriction of the contractile ring before it is complete (Aim 2), and sense the completion of contractile ring assembly (Aim 3)."
"9527155","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed research is to determine the mechanisms by which the FOXO boxO transcription factors, FSH and ovarian---derived growth factors (activin and BMP2) regulate ovarian follicular growth and apoptosis and hence fertility. By disrupting the Foxo1 and Foxo3 genes selectively in granulosa cells, we have generated mice that are infertile with a novel phenotype that is distinct from all other known mutations in granulosa cells. The infertile phenotype can be traced to: 1) Reduced follicle growth and apoptosis leading us to discover a new paradigm: that FOXO1/3 act in granulosa cells to mediate both follicle maturation and apoptosis, and that these distinct functions of FOXO1/3 are tightly linked to specific interactions with either the activin or BMP2 signaling pathways, respectively. 2) Defective oocyte development that appears to be mediated primarily by changes in metabolic/endocrine factors emanating from the mutant cumulus cells. Analyses of cumulus and oocyte functions in the mutant mice should lead us to discover specific FOXO1/3 targets that regulate of oocyte maturation and 3) Alterations in ovarian feedback to the pituitary leading to suppressed FSH that appears to be mediated by a novel ovarian---derived factor that is not inhibin. Characterizing a new Fshb suppressor(s) has far---ranging implications for developing alternative contraceptive targets. Thus, the Foxo1/3 conditional KO mice provide a unique model in which to determine the physiological, molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which these transcriptional regulators impact apoptosis, oocyte maturation and ovarian production of a novel factor(s) that suppresses pituitary Fshb expression. To analyze these functions of Foxo1/3 that control reproductive success, we propose the following Specific Aims: I) Determine how interactions between FSH, activin, BMP2 and FOXO1/3 impact granulosa cell apoptosis in intact follicles. II) Determine the changes in cumulus cell and oocyte functions in the Foxo1/3 mutant mice that impact fertility. III) Characterize the novel Fshb inhibitory factor(s that emanate from the Foxo1/3 mutant ovaries."
"9482363","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Paget's Disease (PD) is the most exaggerated example of coupled bone remodeling with focal areas of increased bone resorption accompanied by exuberant new bone formation. The excessive new bone formation results in deposition of weak woven bone, which is responsible for many of the clinical sequelae of PD including bone deformity or fracture, skull thickening, bone pain and nerve root compression. Osteoclasts (OCLs) drive the increased bone formation, because treatments targeting OCLs decrease bone resorption and formation. However, the mechanisms responsible for the increased bone formation in PD are unknown. Genetic and environmental factors contribute to development of PD. The most frequent mutations linked to PD are in the SQSTM1/p62 gene, in particular p62P392L. Mice harboring germline p62P394L(p62 mice), the murine equivalent of human p62P392L, exhibit increased OCLs, but do not develop PD. OCLs from 70% of PD patients express the measles virus nucleocapsid protein (MVNP) gene, and transgenic mice with targeted expression of MVNP to OCLs (MVNP mice) develop OCLs and bone lesions characteristic of PD. Importantly, loss of IL-6 expression in MVNP mice blocked the pagetic OCL formation and increased bone formation in vivo. Thus, expression of environmental factors (e.g., MVNP) in OCLs is required for the development of characteristic bone abnormalities in PD. Recently, we found that MVNP but not p62P394L increases expression of the coupling factors ephrinB2 by OCLs and EphB4 on osteoblasts (OBs), which was mediated by IL-6. These results suggest that MVNP in OCLs induces coupling factors that increase OB activity. Further, MVNP induced expression of IGF1 by OCLs which may further increase bone formation. This proposal will assess the role of MVNP in the abnormal OB activity in PD by testing the hypothesis that MVNP increases OB activity in PD through induction of ephrinB2 on OCLs and EphB4 on OBs, in part through MVNP's up-regulation of IL-6 and IGF1 in OCLs. Thus, we will: 1) Test the hypothesis that MVNP's induction of ephrinB2 and IGF1 in OCLs and EphB4 in OBs increases OB activity. We will determine the effects of modulating ephrinB2/EphB4 and IGF1 levels/activity on the increased OB activity induced by MVNP. We will also determine if MVNP expression in OCLs from p62P392L PD patients increases ephrinB2 and IGF1 in OCLs and enhances their capacity to induce OB differentiation. 2) Test the hypothesis that IL-6 and IGF1 mediate the induction of ephrinB2 and EphB4 by MVNP. We will determine the mechanisms responsible for IL-6's induction of ephrinB2/ EphB4 by MVNP, and if IGF1 enhances ephrinB2 and/or IL-6 production by OCLs expressing MVNP or simply enhances OB activity via ephrinB2/EphB4. For these studies, we will use cells from MVNP, WT, IL-6-/- and MVNP and WT mice with knockdown of IL-6 or IGF1 in OCLs ex vivo. 3) Generate p62/MVNP mice with targeted deletion of ephrinB2 and/or IGF1 in OCLs and EphB4 in OBs to assess the roles of ephrinB2/EphB4 and IGF1 in the increased OB activity in PD."
"9478542","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to identify the molecular mechanisms of postnatal growth and differentiation of the intervertebral disc (IVD), and how these mechanisms are down-regulated, leading to age-related changes in the IVD. Each IVD consists of a central semi-liquid nucleus pulposus (NP), surrounded by a multi-layered annulus fibrosus (AF), and connected to the bodies of the adjacent vertebral bodies by cartilagenous end plates (EP). Together, these components form a strong joint that resists both tension and compression forces between vertebrae. Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a major cause of lower back pain, and other neurological symptoms leading to a decreased quality of life. DDD is extremely common, affecting as many as one in seven people. The treatment costs are high, and often include surgical intervention. However, treatment is essentially palliative, since it treats the effects of disc degeneration rather than the causes. The long-term goal of this project is to identify potential biological approaches to therapy, using the same pathways by which the IVD normally grows and differentiates. We have developed the mouse lumbar IVD as a model, and preliminary data shows that it can be used to identify the signaling pathways in the IVD that control postnatal growth and differentiation. We have found that during postnatal growth, the NP acts as a signaling center that controls both growth and differentiation. NP cells express SHH, and blockade of Shh signaling both in vitro and in vivo shows that it is essential for cell proliferation and differentiation of the IVD. NP cells also express several Wnt ligands, which are required to maintain Shh signaling in the IVD. Both these signaling pathways, and the downstream targets of Shh signaling, are down-regulated by the end of the growth period. However, Shh signaling, and the expression of differentiation markers, can be re-activated after the growth period by signals present in fetal bovine serum, or by Wnt agonists, showing that down-regulation of growth and differentiation is not irreversible, and offers potential future targets for therapy. Aim 1 of the project tests the hypothesis that the duration of the postnatal growth period is determined by active Wnt signaling. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that a feedback loop between Wnt and Shh signaling is established by Wnt inhibitors expressed downstream of Shh signaling. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that circulating signals control the synchronous growth of all the IVDs by acting on Wnt/Shh signaling loop in the NP. The data from this project will provide the necessary information to explore further the nature of aging of the IVD, the basis of possible biological therapies for disc injury or degeneration, and novel scientific insights into te way growth and differentiation of the IVDs are controlled during postnatal growth."
"9454494","The BSTIM Core will facilitate and coordinate access to state-of-the-art brain stimulation methods - used either to measure brain activity or as a potential therapy to modify the brain - for the COBRE Junior Investigators and other SCRCRS-affiliated researchers and serve as a campus-wide resource.

The aims of the BSTIM Core are to: (1) enable SCRCRS investigators to use advanced BSTIM techniques to study brain plasticity and behavior to guide and individualize rehabilitation therapies by providing leading-edge neurophysiological tools that can be integrated with QBAR and Nl measures; (2) enable SCRCRS investigators to use standardized BSTIM Treatments to optimize the treatment effects of restorative therapies by using current state-of-the-art methods or developing novel tools or methods; (3) mentor all COBRE investigators in Brain Stimulation Methods (for animal and human studies) by providing hands on training for investigators, translational mentoring, periodic workshops in data analysis, and a semiannual Brain Stimulation Intensive Course; and (4) establish BSTIM as a leading resource for MUSC, South Carolina and beyond in Brain Stimulation Methods for recovery from stroke with special emphasis on expertise in using cutting-edge stimulation tools to guide the application of rehabilitation. Core services for neurophysiological assessment include: (1) basic TMS-measured neurophysiology (Motor Threshold, Cortical Silent Period, Paired Pulse, and Recruitment Curves); (2) image-guided stimulation; (3) more specialized approaches such as bi-hemispheric paired pulse for transcallosal measurements and paired-associative stimulation for measures of hemispheric plasticity; and (4) invasive and noninvasive brain stimulation in animal models. Core services for rehabilitation/treatment or restorative therapies include repetitive TMS (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with opportunities to migrate to other brain stimulation methods, such as ECT, VNS, DBS, epidural cortical stimulation, transcranial pulsed ultrasound, etc., as research into stroke recovery progresses."
"9596728","Recent large-scale cancer genome sequencing studies have uncovered epigenetic regulators as a new major class of cancer genes. SETD2 is one such example. SETD2 encodes a non-redundant H3K36 trimethyltransferase and is frequently mutated in a wide variety of human cancers. Based on TCGA datasets, SETD2 is mutated in 13% of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), 8.9% of uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, 8.7% of lung adenocarcinoma, 6.9% of bladder urothelial carcinoma, 5.5% of stomach adenocarcinoma, 5.4% of colorectal adenocarcinoma, 5.2% of melanoma, 4.6 % of hepatocellular carcinoma, etc. The majority of SETD2 mutations identified in ccRCC and lung adenocarcinoma are truncating mutations located upstream of the SRI domain that mediates the interaction of SETD2 with RNA polymerase II. Notably, chromosome 3p where SETD2 resides is commonly deleted in both ccRCC and lung adenocarcinoma. Altogether, these cancer genomics data strongly support a tumor suppressor role of SETD2. However, the tumor suppressor function of SETD2 has not been fully established and how SETD2 loss-of-function promotes tumorigenesis remains unclear. Herein, we have generated conditional Setd2 knockout mice to address the tumor suppressor function/mechanisms of SETD2 in kidney cancer. Notably, SETD2 mutations often co-occur with other well-established driver mutations, such as VHL and PBRM1 in ccRCC, MLL-fusions in acute leukemia, and mutations activating the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway in lung adenocarcinomas, suggesting that SETD2 loss probably cooperates with these driver mutations to promote tumorigenesis. Among cancers in which SETD2 mutations have been reported, ccRCC shows the highest mutation rate. Although ccRCC has long been recognized as a VHL loss-driven disease in which VHL is mutated or silenced in up to 80-90% of ccRCC, deletion of Vhl alone is insufficient to induce kidney cancer in mice, indicating that additional genetic event(s) is required to cooperate with VHL loss for kidney tumorigenesis. Here, we hypothesize that VHL loss and SETD2 loss will cooperate to promote ccRCC development, which will be interrogated using genetically engineered mouse models. Furthermore, our genomic studies indicate that SETD2 mutations are associated with ccRCC progression and metastasis. We plan to establish patient-derived preclinical models of metastatic SETD2 mutant ccRCC to investigate the role of SETD2 loss in promoting tumor metastasis. Our goals are to establish physiological preclinical models of ccRCC based on human cancer genomics, to provide mechanistic understanding of how dysregulated epigenetics conferred by SETD2 loss promotes tumor initiation and metastasis, and to discover novel therapeutic vulnerabilities associated with loss of SETD2."
"9477720","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our chromosomes are continually bombarded with a variety of insults, resulting in damage that must be repaired. By necessity, cells have evolved mechanisms to detect and repair broken strands of DNA, thereby preventing loss of important genetic information. Double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) are a type of damage that led to particularly disastrous outcomes. If not corrected, DSBs can lead to gross chromosomal rearrangements, which are the hallmark of all forms of cancer. Surprisingly, DNA replication is the primary source of DSBs.  Homologous recombination (HR) is a highly conserved pathway that cells can use to repair DSBs, and HR is necessary to prevent and repair the damage that arises during DNA replication. When a DSB occurs, the DNA ends are processed to generate 3' single-strand DNA (ssDNA) overhangs. The ssDNA ends then pair with homologous sequence elsewhere in the genome, and the missing DNA sequence is replaced using the homologous DNA as a template for replication. Finally, the replicated intermediate is resolved, regenerating the continuity of the broken DNA. While seemingly simple, HR requires the coordinated action of a complex repertoire of proteins, which are responsible for sensing damage, recruiting essential factors, and processing and repairing the damaged DNA. The consequences of disrupting HR are devastating. For example, mutations in the Rad51 recombinase are embryonic lethal in mice, and mutations in human Rad51 are linked to breast cancers. In addition, defects in BRCA2 account for at least 5% of all breast cancers and also confer a genetic predisposition to ovarian cancer. BRCA2 is thought to help regulate HR, and loss of this regulation may be the reason why this gene is linked to hereditary cancers. Major new discoveries will be necessary to fully understand the mechanistic basis for these outcomes.  Our overall research program is focused on understanding how (i) proteins sense and respond to damaged DNA, (ii) how DNA damage is repaired, (iii) how DNA replication can lead to damage, and (iv) how replication and recombination are linked. To help address these problems we have developed unique technologies that allow us to directly visualize hundreds of individual molecules using optical microscopy, which enables us to monitor the spatial and temporal progression of DNA repair and DNA replication in real-time at the single-molecule level. Using this approach we seek to define the fundamental mechanisms that our cells use to replicate and repair DNA, with the long-term goal of understanding how errors during these processes can lead to chromosomal rearrangements."
"9507192","B lymphocytes are the central players in the humoral immune response and can have both protective and pathogenic effects. Depletion of B cells is currently being investigated as a therapy for many autoimmune diseases, and has been successful in some but not all cases. A better understanding of the role of particular B cell subsets in both normal and pathological immune responses is critical for developing therapeutic approaches in which only pathogenic B cell functions are eliminated or only protective functions are stimulated. Marginal zone (MZ) B cells, an innate like B cell subset known to participate in T-independent responses, have several features that suggest functions in protective humoral immune responses, autoimmune responses, and regulatory/immunosuppressive responses. One disease in which MZ B cells may play a role is Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). This autoimmune disease is characterized by loss of tolerance to nuclear antigens, the accumulation of autoantibody (autoAb) secreting plasma cells (PCs), and the formation of immune complexes which promote inflammation and cause tissue damage. MZ B cells are enriched in autoreactive specificities. This has been proposed as a mechanism to sequester these potentially dangerous B cells away from T cells and promote B cell tolerance. However, MZ B cells differentiate rapidly into PCs and can participate in T-dependent germinal center reactions in some circumstances. Thus, it is important to understand to what degree MZ B cells contribute to autoimmune responses in lupus. Several murine lupus models have a reduction in MZ B cell numbers, which could result either from impaired development of these cells or from their enhanced differentiation into PCs. Lyn-/- and Ets1-/- mice are two such models. Interestingly, these animals accumulate PCs inappropriately, and Lyn and Ets1 are components of an inhibitory signaling pathway that normally limits PC differentiation. We hypothesize that the loss of MZ B cells in Lyn-/- mice is due to enhanced PC differentiation, and that MZ B cells contribute significantly to the accumulation of PCs and autoAbs in these mice. In Aim 1, we will ask if residual MZ B cells have a gene expression profile consistent with increased activation and PC differentiation or rather impaired commitment to or maintenance of the MZ lineage. We will also use genetic approaches to determine a) whether promoting signals required for MZ B cell development and blocking PC differentiation rescues the MZ B cell compartment in Lyn-/- mice and b) whether preventing MZ B cell development reduces PC accumulation and autoAb production in Lyn-/- mice. In Aim 2, we will generate a new mouse model expressing a MZ B cell specific Cre and use it with a Cre- reporter to mark MZ B cells and their progeny. This will be used to determine what fraction of PCs and GC B cells in Lyn-/- mice are derived from MZ B cells. This mouse model will also have many other valuable future applications, including tracking the fate of MZ derived cells in various types of immune responses and generating MZ B cell specific knockouts of genes to test their function in MZ B cell mediated processes."
"9559863","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has emerged as a silent killer that affects a large segment (15-20%) of the adult population, and is a major risk factor for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), as well as acute kidney injury, cardiovascular disease, and premature death. Progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis is the final common pathway for all kidney diseases leading to CKD. However, the molecular mechanisms and regulatory steps that govern and modulate tubulointerstitial fibrogenesis are not fully understood. The response to tissue injury involves an ordered sequence of partially overlapping phases: inflammatory, proliferation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Previous work has focused on and demonstrated the key role of macrophages in the response to renal injury, with distinct macrophage subsets regulating the balance of renal injury, inflammation, repair, and fibrosis. Results also have shown a key role for tubular epithelial cells (TECs) in renal fibrogenesis. TECs undergo marked phenotypic changes in acute injury and contribute to both inflammatory and pro-fibrotic phases. Recent and very exciting work suggests a critical role for plasminogen (Plg) and the Plg activation system in macrophage function and macrophage involvement in tissue repair, including promotion of key steps in macrophage phagocytosis and signaling. Results also suggest a direct role for Plg in regulating TEC function, including key TEC phenotypic changes and signaling in response to renal injury. This proposal is based on our proteomics-based discovery of a new protein, the plasminogen receptor, Plg-RKT, which markedly enhances the activation of the zymogen Plg to plasmin, as well as concentrates and localizes the proteolytic activity of plasmin at specific sites on the cell surface. We have observed prominent expression of Plg-RKT in macrophages and TECs. We have developed Plg-RKT-/- mouse models, and in recent studies have demonstrated that Plg-RKT plays a major role in macrophage recruitment and function in response to inflammatory stimulation. In addition, Plg-RKT-/- mice exhibit impaired tissue remodeling and impaired fibrin degradation leading to fibrosis in several in vivo settings. Of note, in recent preliminary studies, we have observed marked increases in renal fibrosis in Plg-RKT-/- mice compared to Plg-RKT+/+ mice in response to acute renal injury. In addition, we have observed that Plg-RKT expression is substantially altered in response to experimental renal injury, and in patients with CKD. The overall objectives of this proposal are to test the hypothesis that Plg-RKT plays a major role in the modulation of renal fibrosis in response to renal injury, and to delineate the specific mechanisms and pathways that mediate the effect of Plg-RKT on renal ECM remodeling and repair. We will use a genetic approach to examine the role of cell-specific Plg-RKT in renal ECM remodeling and the modulation of renal fibrosis in vivo. We will perform studies in Plg-RKT-/- and Plg-RKT+/+ mice, mice in which Plg-RKT is deleted in specific cells, including macrophages and TECs, and mice in which Plg-RKT and fibrinogen are concomitantly deleted, allowing us to examine the role of Plg-RKT at defined steps in the renal injury, remodeling, and fibrosis phases. In addition, we will investigate the role of macrophage and TEC Plg-RKT in key cellular steps that regulate renal ECM remodeling and fibrosis at the cellular level, including regulation of release of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages and TECs, regulation of intracellular signaling pathways, regulation of macrophage phagocytosis, and regulation of key TEC phenotypic changes in response to renal injury. This project seeks to provide new information on Plg- RKT as a pivotal regulator of renal ECM remodeling and repair, with important implications not only for renal fibrosis and CKD, but also a broad array of diseases characterized by dysregulated tissue remodeling and inflammation."
"9462108","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a recently characterized disease that has rapidly increased in incidence over the past decade. It affects people at all ages with a preference in children and adults in their 30-40s. The etiology of EoE has been linked to allergen/immune reactions with characterized high levels of cytokines including IL-13. Prolonged inflammation leads to tissue remodeling including hyperplasia of basal progenitor cell, subepithelial fibrosis and stricture of the esophagus. Although current therapies (e.g. topical steroid application) are effective in reducing inflammation, their effects n existing tissue remodeling are largely unknown. Therefore a better understanding of the pathobiology of the disease is necessitated for deriving novel effective treatment. Multiple lines of evidence support that IL-13 plays important roles in the initiation of EoE and subsequent tissue remodeling. Genetic removal of Stat6, downstream target of IL-13 alleviates basal cell hyperplasia. However, how IL-13 regulates basal progenitor cells during tissue remodeling remains unexplored. We previous established that Bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling regulates the differentiation of basal progenitor cells in the developing esophagus. Significantly, our preliminary data suggest Bmp signaling is diminished in EoE mouse models and human biopsies. We therefore propose to determine how Bmp signaling is altered and participates in the pathological progression of EoE. Our central hypothesis is that IL-13 promotes basal cell hyperplasia through the inhibition of Bmp signaling-mediated differentiation during EoE tissue remodeling. We will test these three specific aims: (1) To test the hypothesis that suppressed Bmp signaling promotes basal cell hyperplasia during EoE tissue remodeling. (2) To test the hypothesis that IL-13 promotes basal cell hyperplasia by upregulating the Bmp inhibitor Follistatin. (3) To target Follistatin with novel compounds for attenuating basal cell hyperplasia. This project is expected to provide novel genetic and molecular mechanisms of basal progenitor cell differentiation.

Last year, almost 30 investigators, 69% of whom were Case CCC members, accounting for 71% of total usage, from 6 out of the Center?s 7 Programs used the SR. The facility has the overall goal of providing experimentally useful sources of ionizing radiation to researchers, with the expertise of radiobiology for experimental design and oversight. The Radiation SR provides instrumentation, consultation, and training to investigators who need to irradiate samples, cells or animals in their research. Case CCC investigators have designed, implemented, and published methods to adapt clinical radiosurgery devices for use in small animal experiments. These include CyberKnife and Gamma Knife machines that are currently in use by researchers to deliver radiotherapy to animals with great precision. The Specific Aims of the Radiation SR are to: 1. Maintain, calibrate, and operate ionizing radiation-producing devices for cancer researchers. 2. Provide consultation to users about instrumentation, services, training requirements, experimental design,  and provide support for implementation of new security regulations. 3. Train new users in proper and safe operation of Radiation SR equipment. 4. Allow investigators to develop pre-clinical models with novel technology that enables clinical activities. The Radiation SR has been successful in its mission, and was rated Outstanding to Exceptional Merit at the last review. Throughout the current funding cycle (2012-2016), the Radiation SR provided services to 75 registered users, 45 (60%) of whom are Case CCC members, representing all 7 of the Case CCC programs. The Radiation SR provides basic irradiation services to support studies investigating 1) radiobiology in cancer; 2) properties of bone marrow biology; and 3) studies in which bone marrow ablation or cell irradiation is used as a sterilization tool. Due to the close relationship of the Radiation SR Director and Department of Radiation Oncology, the Radiation SR also facilitates the use of clinical irradiation devices for preclinical small animal research. This SR is managed and supported by the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC), and the facility?s user base consists primarily of Case CCC members. The Radiation SR is the only radiation facility on the campus of Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), and formal access is provided across institutions to all Case CCC investigators."
"9477110","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Since our last renewal, the challenges for biomedical researchers of keeping up with the scientific literature have become even more acute. Last year marked the first time that Medline indexed more than a million journal articles; more than 210,000 of these had full text deposited in PubMedCentral, bringing the total number of full texts archived in PMC to over 3 million. The stunning pleiotropy of genes and their products, combined with the adoption of genome-scale technologies throughout biomedical research, has made obsolete the notion that reading within one's own specialty plus a few top journals is enough to keep track of all of the results relevan to one's research. Fortunately, advances in biomedical natural language processing and increasing access to digital full text journal publications offer the potential for innovative new approaches to delivering relevant information to working bench scientists.         We hypothesize that realizing the potential of biomedical natural language processing applied to full text journal articles to make a sustained and powerful contribution to biomedical research requires contextualizing Biomedical natural language processing in the daily life of bench scientists, focusing on their unmet information gathering needs, and providing interfaces that fit well into existing research workflows."
"9478536","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The relative levels of RANKL and its negative regulator, OPG, are critical for the initiation and progression of osteoclastogenesis. However, factors that modulate the amplitude and tempo of osteoclastogenesis are less well understood, and growing evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) play an important role in this process. One miRNA can regulate families of structural or signaling molecules within a particular pathway; thus miRNAs can amplify or dampen the effects of extracellular signals, balancing and buffering cellular responses, in addition to regulating the cross talk between signaling pathways.  In the osteoclast lineage, miR-29 family members are highly expressed, are increased during osteoclast differentiation, and promote osteoclastogenesis. Our in vitro data demonstrate that miR-29 promotes osteoclastogenesis, at least in part, by promoting commitment to the osteoclast fate and by supporting cell migration. To address possible mechanisms, we identified a novel set of miR-29 targets with the potential to regulate commitment, cytoskeletal organization, cell motility and osteoclast function. In addition, we developed an in vivo model (miR-29 competitive inhibitor or sponge mice) for studying miR-29 actions in osteoclasts, and these mice display increased trabecular bone volume.  We hypothesize that miR-29 promotes osteoclastogenesis, at least in part, by supporting cell migration and lineage commitment, and therefore is essential for normal bone remodeling. In Aim 1, we will perform a comprehensive analysis of miR-29 function during osteoclastogenesis using TRAP-miR-29 sponge mice. We will characterize the skeletal phenotype of miR-29 sponge mice, and determine effects of the miR-29 sponge on lineage commitment, differentiation, apoptosis and resorption in primary cells. Live cell imaging will be used to evaluate parameters of cell motility and fusion. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms by which miR-29 and its targets control osteoclastogenesis, by studying the function of 2 newly validated miR-29 targets that are strongly regulated by RANKL, but have not been previously studied in the osteoclast lineage: SRGAP2 and CD93. Knock down and over expression studies will be performed in vitro and in vivo, and effects on commitment, motility, cytoskeletal organization and resorption will be quantified.  Impact: Understanding how miR-29 and its targets regulate osteoclastogenesis will provide important new information about the process of osteoclastogenesis itself. Further, miRNA-based therapeutics represent powerful tools treating disease, and are in clinical trials. A serious limit to their utility is the gap in our knowledge o miRNA targets and regulated networks in multiple cell types. Such information is critical for the development of novel therapeutics, their translation to the clinic, and for predicting efficacy and safety. Some mechanisms that we study in osteoclasts could be active in other cell systems; therefore this work could also contribute to our understanding of the role of the miR-29 family in cancer, aging and diabetes."
"9479629","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A possible link between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) has been suggested, but evidence for a causal connection is limited due to shortage of prospective studies using objective measures of IHD. In addition, potential mechanisms remain unclear. A biological hallmark of PTSD is enhanced sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity with stress, especially in response to trauma-reminiscent stimuli. Our overarching hypothesis is that repeated SNS activation with trauma reminders in PTSD leads to microvascular dysfunction, endothelial injury and immune activation which, in turn, increase the risk of myocardial ischemia and acute coronary syndromes. The proposed project is a follow-up study of 281 male twin pairs (562 individuals) from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry 10 years after their baseline visit when they were extensively phenotyped, including assessment of IHD with positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging. In about 180 pairs, we will repeat PET imaging to obtain longitudinal quantitative indicators of IHD. Furthermore, we will administer standardized traumatic memory tasks to examine vascular and immune responses to stress. In addition to a longitudinal design, state-of-the art measures of IHD, and consideration of novel mechanisms, this project has the advantage of a twin sample, which will allow us to control for genetic and familial influences and parse the relative contributions of genes and shared/unshared environment to the association between PTSD and IHD. The aims are: (1) Examine if PTSD is related to worsening of IHD measured longitudinally with PET myocardial perfusion imaging (summed total severity score of myocardial perfusion, and coronary flow reserve); (2) Examine if PTSD is related to adverse vascular and immune responses during traumatic memory tasks (peripheral vasoconstriction by means of pulsatile arterial tonometry, and markers of endothelial injury and inflammation: circulating progenitor cells and adhesion molecules). For both aims, we will assess if effects are independent of genetics, shared environment and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, we will investigate vulnerability and resilience factors, including type of trauma (e.g., combat vs. noncombat), childhood trauma, depression comorbidity, social support, and PTSD trajectory (duration of PTSD, PTSD remission), and whether vascular and immune responses to trauma reminders predict IHD. Our rigorous twin study will sharpen the understanding of the links between PTSD and IHD, and test the new paradigm that immune and vascular reactivity during trauma reminders play a fundamental role. This research should fill a significant gap in evidence regarding the long-term cardiovascular consequences of PTSD, and potentially help in the development of new methods for risk prediction and prevention to reduce the burden of IHD among persons with PTSD. These data should facilitate incorporating stress processes into the mainstream of cardiovascular research and clinical practice, which is exceedingly overdue."
"9509965","Project Summary. During the last six years, our team conducted four randomized clinical trials of psychosocial treatments for adolescents with ADHD with a cumulative sample size of 876 youth (ages of 11- 17; Sibley et al., 2016, under review, in preparation, in progress) with funding from the NIMH (R34 MH092466, R01 MH106587), Institute of Education Sciences (R305A150433), and the Klingenstein Third Generation Foundation. In the current proposal, we outline a plan to conduct an Integrative Data Analysis (IDA; Curran & Hussong, 2009) that will pursue a linked series of person-level treatment outcome analyses. We will combine multimethod (i.e., observational, parent-rated, self-rated, teacher-rated, official records) data from the four recent RCTs (cumulative N=876) that evaluate brief psychosocial treatments for adolescents with ADHD across a range of settings, interventions, and referral characteristics. Common across studies is a Baseline (BL)-Post Treatment (POST)-Follow up (FU) design and a standard battery was delivered across studies that includes core primary and secondary outcome measures (see Table 3). In the first months of Y01, Drs. Sibley & Coxe will work with Dr. Curran to create a harmonized data set. Following completion of the final database, the team will conduct a series of Latent Class Analyses, Mixture Models, and Structural Equation Models as outlined in the study aims. These analyses will identify treatment-related phenotypes and family-risk profiles using latent class analysis that organize the heterogeneous population into clinically meaningful subgroups. We will then examine questions of treatment moderation, such as whether latent classes predict treatment engagement (% of prescribed treatment course attended), and whether latent classes and adjunctive supports (i.e., medication, parent involvement style, school accommodations) predict treatment response trajectories on two primary outcomes (parent-rated ADHD symptoms and GPA). We will also examine whether there are treatment-level variables (time of year, setting of treatment, content of treatment) that moderate the relationship between phenotype and response. Finally, we will use structural equation modeling to identify key treatment mediators (i.e., teen organization skills, parent contingency management, parent-teen conflict, parental well-being) and to examine whether significance of mediators varies by phenotype, treatment-level variables, and parenting profile. We believe that pursuing personalized medicine questions for adolescents with ADHD could provide useful information that promotes improved treatment engagement and response? leading to meaningful changes in long-term outcome for individuals with ADHD, whose adult trajectory is highly related to experiences in adolescence (Barkley et al., 2008; Molina et al., 2012; Sibley et al., 2014). Treatment research for adolescents with ADHD lags behind research on treatments for children with ADHD. As a result, complex person-level and mediator x moderator analyses have not been conducted with this population? namely due to sample size limitations in extant studies."

"9602322","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by microvascular disease from inflammation and oxidative damage. Many adult patients with SCD suffer from cognitive impairment (CI), a serious complication responsible for severe functional limitations, and whose pathogenesis, risk factors, and natural history are unknown. Thus, elucidating CI holds high public health significance because it will allow the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies. In this first RO1 application, Dr. Novelli builds on his prir work on the vascular biology of SCD and proposes that CI is caused by specific, quantifiable, cerebral microvascular disease, in turn caused by inflammation and oxidative damage from pathologic reactive oxygen species (ROS). He specifically proposes that the inflammatory protein TSP1 promotes ROS generation that leads to cerebrovascular disease and ultimately CI. This novel pathway has never been tested in SCD because of the lack of comprehensive longitudinal assessments of risk factors of CI and adequate MRI methods to image the cerebral microvasculature. This proposal addresses these barriers via the application of 7T MRI neuroimaging in a well- characterized cohort of adults with SCD in combination with neurocognitive testing and blood biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative damage. This project is expected to generate critical new knowledge on the pathophysiology of CI and its risk factors as targets for early prevention, screening and intervention. This study leverages Dr. Novelli's expertise and current work in the vascular biology of SCD, and builds on Dr. Novelli's ongoing study in this cohort, supported by institutional funds, a strong clinical research infrastructure ad existing collaborative efforts with investigators expert in Neuroepidemiology, Biostatistics, Neuroimaging, Psychiatry, Neuropsychology, and microvascular disease. These collaborations have already led to strong, published, preliminary results that support this application. This project is also highly innovative because it tests a new paradigm of microvascular dysfunction-related CI in SCD with state-of-the-art technology. Our scientific questions are articulated into two aims, Aim1, cross-sectional and Aim 2, longitudinal. In Aim 1 we first plan to extend and confirm in a larger cohort (n=160 patients and 70 controls) our preliminary results showing worse cognitive function and burden of 7T MRI microvascular abnormalities in patients as compared to controls (H1). Within patients, we will then test the hypothesis that worse 7T MRI abnormalities are linked to worse cognitive function (H2) and that high TSP1 levels are associated with both worse 7T MRI abnormalities and cognitive function (H3). Finally, we test the hypothesis that ROS mediates the association between TSP1 and these outcomes (H4). In Aim 2, these hypotheses will be tested in a longitudinal design with repeated MRI at 3 years and repeated blood and cognitive measures at 3 and 5 years."

"9478600","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mammalian neocortex is an enormous network of cells, each making thousands of connections and an array of neurological conditions can result from inappropriate cortical structure or connectivity. Many of these congenital brain defects have a genetic origin but we still lack a full understanding of the genes and mechanisms involved. The overall objective of this application is to use forward genetic approaches in mouse and human to identify and validate novel alleles important for development of cortical circuitry and overall structure. Our central hypothesis is that a synergistic and unbiased forward genetic approach in mouse and human will lead to fundamental discoveries in the genetics of cortical circuit formation and structural development. The rationale of this proposed research is that by identifying novel genes through forward genetic approaches which are required for normal cortical development using both human and mouse genetics, we are then positioned to use this information and tools to study the etiological mechanisms of human cortical malformations in subsequent studies. We will test this central hypothesis and accomplish the goals of this application by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) use forward genetics in the mouse to efficiently generate and capture genetic mutations in loci important for cortical circuit formation and structural development, 2) identify and validate causal mutations in novel mouse models of cortical circuit formation and structural brain defects, and 3) apply next-generation sequencing approaches to identify mutations leading to human movement disorders and structural brain defects. The aims are accomplished by an ENU mutagenesis approach in the mouse with the addition of a novel transgenic reporter which is expressed specifically in cortical layer V pyramidal neurons. The mutations are then cloned and validated through a number of functional studies. The human genetics studies are performed with the application of exome sequencing to carefully selected familial cases of movement disorders and structural brain malformations. These studies will identify several genes essential for mammalian forebrain structure and function. The significance of this work is found in the specific application to cortial circuitry and structure, and that an unbiased approach such as this has the capability to implicate entirely new pathways in neurological disease. A synergistic approach using both mouse and human genetics to specifically query these aspects of neural development allows fundamental insights into the genetics of development and disease. Such knowledge is not only critical to further understand the basic mechanisms of neurodevelopment, but also has immediate clinical relevance through identification of a number of potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, these mouse models provide a reusable resource to directly characterize the role of the mutated gene in neurodevelopment, and potentially serve as a tool to test future therapeutic interventions. Taken together, these findings are therefore applicable to basic developmental neurobiology, pediatric and adult neurology, human genetics and genetic counseling."

"9463771","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) efficiently establishes persistent infection, with 200 million people currently infected worldwide. In the US, chronic HCV infection accounts for 15,000 deaths via end-stage liver diseases such as liver cancer and decompensated cirrhosis. In addition, nearly 20,000 individuals are newly infected with HCV annually, thereby posing a continuous threat to public health. Thus, an effective prevention strategy remains essential to mitigating the burden of HCV. Towards this ultimate goal, furthering our understanding of host immunity against viral infection plays a critical role. Interferon stimulated genes (ISG) constitute over 300 innate immune effectors which cooperatively restrict viral infection and are critical determinants for efficient mounting of adaptive immunity. ISG expression is dynamic, occurring through differential strength and duration of interferon (IFN) signaling. However, the processes that regulate ISG expression to facilitate viral restriction are poorly defined. In search of novel host factors that stimulate ISG expression for the suppression of HCV infection, we have conducted comprehensive genome-wide cDNA screening. These studies identified the non-receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (TNK1) as a signaling molecule pivotal for enhanced ISG expression and restriction of HCV infection. Our studies indicate that TNK1 presides over a novel signaling pathway that imparts serine phosphorylation of STAT1, resulting in induction of a specific group of ISG that have potent anti-HCV activity. Therefore the proposed studies aim to investigate the hypothesis that the TNK1 pathway induces anti-HCV effectors through a unique process of STAT1 activation. We will conduct the following aims: (Aim 1) Determine the mechanism of TNK1 activation and characterize its enzymatic activity, (Aim 2) Define the signaling cascade governed by TNK1 mediated serine phosphorylation of STAT1, and (Aim 3) Determine the in vivo role of TNK1 in hepatic antiviral innate immunity. The results from this study will provide novel insights into a front line defense against viral infection and contribute to a prevention strategy against HCV infection and emerging viral diseases."
"9536691","Summary Skin is under frequent assaults from environmental agents. Various immune cells reside in the skin to protect against the assaults. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a family of recently identified innate lymphocytes that are preferentially enriched in barrier tissues such as the skin for local protection but they could be also involved in promoting the skin inflammatory diseases if dysregulated. Understanding how skin-specific localization and function of the innate lymphoid cells are regulated is critical in helping to design the strategy targeting specific innate lymphocyte populations for therapeutic purposes. Our previous study has found that the majority of ILCs in the healthy skin expressed a skin- specific chemokine receptor CCR10. In addition, we found that the skin-specific CCR10+ ILCs were generated in skin-draining lymph nodes (sLNs) under homeostatic conditions with help of skin-associated CD207+ dendritic cells (DCs) and depended on CCR10 for their localization in the skin, where they regulate regulatory and effector T cells to promote skin immune homeostasis. Under immune dysregulatory or inflammatory conditions, generation of CCR10+ ILCs was reduced while there was increased differentiation of CCR10+ ILCs into CCR10- ILCs in the skin, suggesting that CCR10+ and CCR10- ILCs are differentially involved in the skin homeostasis and inflammation. In this application, we will determine cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying generation and function of skin-specific ILCs in homeostasis and inflammation."
"9688326","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of Personalized Medicine is to implement advances in biomarker pharmacology, molecular diagnostics and genomics to improve public health. For the full benefits of this science to be realized, it is critical that scientific advancs made in experimental settings and on a small scale be extended to community practice and that a business case can be made to support such dissemination. It is important that key innovations be extended beyond individual hospital settings to large health care systems, especially those that include underserved populations. Many scientific advances bypass underserved populations, and as a result inequalities of care and cost inefficiencies result. In 2011, the Indiana Institute for Personalized Medicine (IPM) was created to serve as an academic home for basic and clinical researchers committed to research in personalized medicine. A specific goal of the IPM is to move this science towards clinical practice. To that end, the purpose of this proposal is to pilot a genomic platform in a large safety-net health care system, and to measure the economic costs and clinical outcomes of doing so. Eskenazi Health handles over 1.2 million outpatient visits per year and > 15,000 admissions annually, with a payer mix that include 45% uninsured, 26% Medicaid and 18% Medicare patients. In this proposal, the IPM will partner with Eskenazi Health and the Regenstrief Institute to recruit a new Eskenazi cohort of genotyped patients. A multidisciplinary group of clinicians and information scientists will pilot an innovatie approach to the implementation of pharmacogenomic science. The Regenstrief Institute has a proven track record of innovation in medical informatics, and has created an ideal environment in which to assess real clinical outcomes. The specific aims of this proposal will be: 1) To test the hypothesis that a CLIA certified genotyping test targeted at 24 widely used drugs is associated with significant reductions in hospital and outpatient economic costs incurred over 1 year; and 2) To test whether such pharmacogenetic testing is associated with significant improvements in clinical outcomes over 1 year. Patients will be randomized either to an intervention arm, involving pharmacogenotyping, insertion of results in the medical record and dissemination of relevant results and decision algorithms to providers (n=2000 patients), or to usual care (n=4000 patients). This trial will be implemented in Eskenazi primary care clinics and 6 specialty clinics. Economic costs and clinical outcomes including clinic visits, hospital admissions, length of stay, adverse drug reactions, morbidity and mortality, will be followed prospectively and compared between the two groups. To sustain this effort, we will extend access to this testing to IU Health, and the affiliated NCI Simon Cancer Center and Riley Hospital for Children. Data from this study will allow for the first time the development of an objective business case for pharmacogenomic personalization based on real world costs and outcomes."

"9416711","PROJECT SUMMARY We have previously identified distinct functional outcomes in lung alveolar septal endothelium on activation of TRPV4, a Ca channel in the vanilloid transient receptor potential family, or the ?1G T-type voltage-gated Ca 2+ 2+ channel. Despite equivalent whole-cell Ca2+ transients in the extremely thin septal endothelium, TRPV4 only increases endothelial permeability while the T-channel only increases endothelial surface expression of P- selectin. As a result, we propose a critical paradigm shift, from a global perspective of Ca2+-dependent signaling to one where Ca2+ microdomains, orchestrated by mitochondrial-dependent Ca2+ buffering, are organized to yield discrete functional outcomes within lung microvascular endothelial cells. Our preliminary data suggest discrete localization of these Ca2+channels and distribution of mitochondria even into the attenuated cell periphery in lung microvascular endothelium in situ. Further, we have documented that mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction leads to loss of domain constraints with greater spread and duration of TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ transients and increased endothelial permeability in lung microvascular endothelium. Collectively, these observations led us to the HYPOTHESIS that in lung microvascular endothelium, mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering constrains Ca2+ influx via TRPV4 or the T-type channel to spatially delimited cytosolic microdomains yielding specificity of functional outcomes, constraints lost with mitochondrial dysfunction. Our SPECIFIC AIMS are to: 1) determine the contribution of mitochondria to buffering of the spatial spread, dynamics and functional specificity of Ca2+ signals on activation of TRPV4 or T-type Ca2+ channels, and 2) determine the extent to which mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction decreases the threshold for and specificity of functional outcomes on activation of TRPV4 or T-type Ca2+ channels. We will utilize innovative high-speed hyperspectral excitation scanning imaging and novel analytical tools to detect and interpret signal dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. These data will be interpreted in context of localized functional outcomes, in naïve endothelium, in endothelium after disruption of mitochondrial- dependent buffering and after initiation of mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction in the intact lung with hyperoxia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced sepsis. We predict that such dysfunction will lead to blurring of specificity for Ca2+ signaling, altering the set point from which lung endothelium interprets Ca2+ signaling with mechanical stress. This work will provide the first insight into mechanisms underlying Ca2+ microdomains in lung microvascular endothelium. To accomplish this, we have assembled an outstanding team with expertise spanning from structural and functional determinants of endothelial permeability, development and use of novel tools, and modeling of signaling domains/networks to bioenergetics and sepsis."
"9519140","Project Summary/Abstract Cancer and other chronic diseases are the leading causes of death in the United States for working-age adults. There are several behavioral risk factors that increase disease risk, including missed cancer screenings, physical inactivity, poor eating habits, and tobacco use. Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) exist that improve each of these risk behaviors, and many of these EBIs can be implemented in worksites where the majority of U.S. adults spend most of their waking hours. There are significant disparities in access to worksite EBIs; large worksites (more than 1000 employees) are much more likely to offer EBIs to their employees than small worksites with less than 250 employees. The American Cancer Society (ACS) and the University of Washington Health Promotion Research Center (HPRC) developed HealthLinks, a package of EBIs appropriate and feasible for small worksites. We are currently completing a randomized controlled trial of HealthLinks with more than 70 small worksites; results show that worksites in the HealthLinks arms implemented significantly more EBIs at follow-up than worksites in the delayed control arm. Now that we know HealthLinks is effective, we need a way to scale it up beyond the location of the trial. Local health departments (LHDs) cover almost every community in the United States and most LHDs' missions include preventing chronic disease. In a separate project, we pilot-tested training staff in six LHDs in Washington State to deliver HealthLinks to worksites in their communities. We found that LHD staff completed the training and recruited worksites to participate in HealthLinks; these worksites implemented EBIs. The primary goals of this competing renewal are (a) to scale up HealthLinks by training staff in LHDs across the United States to deliver HealthLinks to small employers in their communities, and (b) to further implementation science by conducting a hybrid type III trial comparing the effectiveness and costs of two different implementation strategies. We will achieve these goals through three specific aims, guided by the HPRC Dissemination and Implementation Framework. We will conduct qualitative audience research with state and local health department directors and local health department staff to refine our training and support approaches (Aim 1); we will conduct a hybrid type III trial comparing standard and enhanced technical assistance combined with online training for HealthLinks (Aim 2); and we will measure the costs of each strategy, both to the local health departments and to the research team (Aim 3). The proposed activities will increase the reach of HealthLinks across the United States to small employers with limited capacity for and access to EBIs. These activities will also advance implementation science by measuring the impact and costs of implementation strategies offering different levels of ongoing support. The findings from this project may inform implementation strategies for other workplace health promotion programs focused on EBIs and small worksites, as well as a variety of implementation efforts that include partnerships with LHDs."
"9455636","PROJECT SUMMARY We are requesting three years of support to conduct an open-label, dose-escalating, Phase I clinical trial in subjects with recurrent malignant glioma (MG) to determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), safety and toxicities of a novel modification of a ??134.5 Herpes Simplex Virus (??134.5 HSV) that expresses human interleukin-12 (M032, NSC733972). This oncolytic HSV was developed under a Program Project Grant (CA071933) and has been extensively tested in vitro and preclinically in two animal species, including nonhuman primates. These studies have shown M032 to be as safe as other clinical oncolytic ??134.5 HSV (G207, 1716) used intracerebrally, to have no unexpected toxicities in immunocompromised mice or immunocompetent animals (mice, non-human primates), and to replicate 10-1000 fold better than G207 in a variety of preclinical models of MG. We have conducted three Phase I clinical trials with G207 in a similar patient population (17 of 35 subjects had objective responses) and will apply our unique knowledge and experience to evaluate this novel HSV. The NExT program produced cGMP clinical grade M032 (NSC733972) at >3 x 109 PFU/ml, generating >560 single-dose vials. The FDA has issued IND #14,946, a trial protocol and informed consent were IRB- approved and the first subject has been treated without DLTs (NCT02062827). In Aim 1, this first-in-human Phase I clinical trial will use a modified Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) to determine dose modifications to obtain both safety and toxicity data as well as secondary biologic correlative information critical to assessing the potential application of this virus to treat malignant brain tumors. Subjects with biopsy-proven recurrent MG will have M032 infused (400?l/hr x 6 hrs) in up to four sites in the enhancing tumor mass via stereotactically placed catheters and will be monitored adverse effects and survival. Dose escalation in each subsequent subject will occur after a 24 day interval and will be defined by the CRM. We will determine the RP2D, will identify any unanticipated toxicities and will determine, secondarily, progression-free and overall survivals. In Aim 2, we will simultaneously acquire biological specimens from each subject on a designated longitudinal timeline and process these for immediate analyses or for cryopreservation and batch analyses at a later time. We propose to: a) assess M032 shedding in blood, saliva, and conjunctival secretions by virus culture and PCR; b) document serological (antibody titers) and cellular immune responses (profiling, proliferation and function of immune subsets) to M032 infusion; c) define changes from an immune suppressing environment to an immune enhancing environment, including changes in circulating cytokines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells; and d) establish tumor genotype differences that might reveal molecular bases for tumor susceptibility or resistance. Previously archived tumor tissues (when available) and blood DNA will be analyzed to provide an in-depth molecular profile for each subject's tumor. Analyses will be focused to define a RP2D of M032 and will consider all clinical variables and correlative parameters to better inform future trial designs for the best outcomes."
"9563951","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Children and adolescents with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) experience significant problems with social adjustment, adversely impacting quality of life across the lifespan. Social adjustment refers to the quality of the child's social relationships and their attainment of developmentally appropriate goals. Youth with NF1 also experience clinically significant impairments across a variety of neuropsychological domains including global intelligence, attention, and executive function. Despite evidence that neurocognitive weaknesses and family- systems factors contribute to worse social adjustment in other pediatric neurological populations, few studies have examined these associations in children with NF1. The broad objective of this proposal is to apply a developmental model of social competence in childhood brain disorder to identify aspects of social information processing underlying social interaction and social adjustment difficulties in youth with NF1. Social information processing encompasses domains such as executive functions and social-affective processing (i.e., theory of mind). The specific aims of this proposal are to 1) Compare youth with NF1 and healthy controls across domains of social competence; and 2) Establish associations among elements of social information processing, social interactions, and social adjustment in youth with NF1, and determine the role of family functioning in youth's social behaviors. [The proposed study will inform the development of evidence-based interventions designed to improve social interactions and social adjustment in this population, which currently do not exist.] Youth ages [10 to 15] with a diagnosis of NF1 (n = 40), healthy age-matched controls (n = 40), will be recruited from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Participants will complete a brief neuropsychological battery assessing IQ, executive functioning, and theory of mind. Ratings of social interactions, relationship quality, perceived social acceptance, and family functioning will be collected from caregivers, teachers, and peers. Training goals include: 1) develop advanced knowledge in typical and atypical social and cognitive development within an ecological/developmental framework; 2) acquire expertise in the biological and genetic bases of neurological disease; 3) bolster advanced neuropsychological case conceptualization skills; and 4) enhance scientific skills related to research design, methodology, and statistical techniques. The proposed project advances the NICHD's vision, enhancing the understanding of mechanisms underlying atypical cognitive and behavioral development. A greater understanding of processes underlying psychosocial deficits in this population will allow providers to identify those at greatest risk for social difficulties, and inform novel, targeted intervention strategies aimed at improving functional and quality of life outcomes."

"9693552","Although significant advances in the treatment of opiate addiction have been made, relapse to opiate use after abstinence continues to impede successful treatment, highlighting the need for efforts to dissect the mechanism of opiate-dependent changes in brain function. Long-lasting associations between opiates and the context in which they are taken result in cues that lead to drug craving and ultimately relapse. The hippocampus has traditionally been recognized for its role in learning and memory but recent evidence has shown its critical role in the behavioral effects of opiates, probably via activation of hippocampal excitatory inputs to the reward pathway (i.e. Nucleus Accumbens, NAc). Several lines of evidence suggest that drug- induced contextual/cue memories are associated with molecular changes in hippocampal function and that these changes may be necessary for some behavioral effects of opiates. Results from our laboratory have revealed that AMPAR and NMDAR play a crucial role in opiate-induced contextual learning. In addition SK2 channels, which are functionally linked to NMDAR, are critically involved in coding contextual memories. Furthermore, we have recently found that context-dependent sensitization to morphine leads to the activation of SK2 channels in the hippocampus. SK2-mediated functional effects on activated spines may be responsible for the expression and reinstatement of morphine place preference behavior. We also have preliminary data showing that the intrahippocampal administration of the SK2 blocker, apamin, following conditioning training, blocks the expression of morphine CPP. However, there are no reports dissecting how SK2 channels influence learning for opiate-paired contextual/cue behavior. Our central hypothesis is that enhancement of SK2 function, via increased Ca2+ influx through NMDAR, in the hippocampus plays a critical role in the formation of the association between the drug reward experience and the context/cue. Our overall objective is to uncover the cellular mechanisms underlying morphine-induced activation of SK2 channels, and to investigate how the activation of hippocampal SK2 channels are integral for morphine-induced contextual/cue learned associations, using both the CPP and i.v. drug self-administration models. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms by which SK2 channel function is increased following morphine contextual/cue associations. In Aim 2, we will define the requirement for enhanced SK2 channel function in the expression and reinstatement of morphine contextual/cue associations in vivo. In Aim 3, we will determine whether hippocampal excitatory inputs to the NAc are enhanced during morphine-contextual/cue associations and to measure the underlying SK2-mediated changes in hippocampal pyramidal neuronal networks. Studies proposed here offer potentially novel drug addiction treatments in targeting SK2 channels to prevent drug-context/cue associations and thus prevent relapse to opiate use."
"9502819","Significance: This project evaluates access to emergency care for Veterans with particular emphasis on: assessing resources and capabilities of VA EDs to care for Veterans during times of crisis, determining where care is provided (VA vs. non-VA EDs), and understanding how and why Veterans make decisions regarding where to seek emergency care. The objectives of this proposal are directly responsive to HSRD priority areas (Access and Health systems change) and three of the VA Breakthrough priority areas (Improve Access to Health Care, Improve Community Care, and Improve the Veteran Experience). We also address Secretary Shulkin's priority areas (Choice Act, improve infrastructure). Dr. Vashi and her team have strong ties to VA and non-VA operational and policy partners, including the VA National Director of Emergency Medicine, which will be instrumental in translating research findings into meaningful improvements in policy.  Background and Innovation: Emergency care is a critical but understudied part of the continuum of health care services offered to Veterans by the VA. While the VA is committed to providing timely and high- quality emergency care, surprisingly little is known about Veteran access to acute care or about the quality of care provided. Variations in VA emergency care resources are not well understood and prevent Veterans from making informed choices. Moreover, eligibility for non-VA ED care is confusing, complex and can translate to delays in treatment and poor outcomes. VA estimates that current VA users get, on average, only about 38% of their ED visits from VA, yet no study to date has examined emergency care Veterans receive in non-VA settings. While use of non-VA EDs may sometimes be appropriate, there are other times when the ED care could have been provided at the VA and use of the non-VA ED may result in duplicative care and delays. This dual use matters to the VA because, like an Accountable Care Organization, the VA is still responsible for the overall health of the Veteran and often the expenses even when Veterans receive care outside of the VA.  Aims: Objectives of this proposal are: (1) To create survey items that facilitate a comprehensive inventory of VA ED resources and capabilities; (2) to calculate VA and non-VA ED utilization rates and identify the patient, facility, and community-level predictors of VA ED use and VA reliance; and (3) to characterize Veterans' preferences, resources and contextual factors that influence ED setting choice (i.e. VA, non-VA).  Methods: We will build on pilot work and convene an advisory panel to create and add survey items to the next ED survey to assess VA ED resources and capabilities and determine how they vary (e.g. region, rurality, complexity). Using an innovative linkage method, we will use VA, Medicare, and California data to examine ED use across groups. Further, we will assess the patient, facility, and community level predictors of Veterans' choice of delivery system and VA reliance. All analyses will be conducted for three cohorts: a national accountable veteran population (Veterans 65+), residents of California (Veterans 65+), and residents of California (Veterans 18-64). Finally, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with Veterans to better understand why Veterans choose to receive their ED care inside or outside the VA. As underscored by the Secretary, our methods rely on ?what Veterans actually tell us? and lay the groundwork for future comparisons of VA and non-VA ED quality metrics.  Expected results: We will determine capabilities of VA EDs nationwide and examine the impact of these factors on VA ED use and reliance. Further by analyzing data and speaking with Veterans, we will better understand where and why Veterans access the acute care system (in both VA and non-VA settings) and will identify barriers in access amendable to future intervention and policy changes. Once we can identify patients receiving care outside the VA and determine why they made that decision, we can then develop interventions to keep Veterans ?in-network? when appropriate."
"9693559","Project Summary / Abstract  Cocaine addiction is a debilitating mental health disorder that interferes with an individual?s well-being, disrupts relationships, and burdens society. Cocaine, like other drugs of abuse, hijacks the brain?s reward center, producing enduring changes in brain regions, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc), that perpetuate the cycle of addiction. Preclinical studies show that cocaine and other psychostimulants act as general enhancers of gene expression and that histone deacetylases (HDACs) in the NAc play a key role in the development of cocaine addiction. However, neurobiological understanding of the role of specific HDACs in these processes is limited and there are few in vivo studies on these targets. In response to the need for such studies, this proposal integrates state-of-the-art small animal positron emission tomography (PET) techniques with a model of cocaine self-administration (coc-SA) to study the role of NAc HDAC Class IIa (HDAC5) enzymatic activity during cocaine taking and seeking behaviors. The combination of in vivo neuroimaging and behavioral neuroscience methods in a longitudinal (repeated-measures) design presents an opportunity to advance understanding of the role of epigenetic activity in the NAc during the 4 phases of coc-SA, including acquisition, maintenance, extinction, and reinstatement. Our overall hypothesis is that cocaine will decrease the enzymatic activity of HDAC Class IIa proteins in the NAc, which will statistically explain increases in cocaine taking and seeking behaviors. Three aims will test this hypothesis. (1) Determine HDAC Class IIa enzymatic activity in the NAc using PET imaging and a novel substrate-based PET ligand at baseline and during the phases of coc-SA. (2) Determine the changes in HDAC Class IIa enzymes and protein targets in the NAc at the different phases of coc-SA using immunohistochemistry. (3) Determine the effect of nuclear HDAC5 in the NAc on class IIa HDAC enzymatic activity during cocaine seeking behavior. The combination of non-invasive PET assays with behavioral neuroscience methods to study the role of HDAC Class IIa enzyme activity in the NAc during cocaine taking and seeking behaviors provides a unique strategy to study the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the stages of addiction. The proposed studies of this application will deliver translational knowledge that addresses theoretical and neurobiological gaps in our understanding of the role of epigenetics in cocaine addiction. This knowledge will aid in the development of novel neurotherapeutics that target epigenetic regulators and treat this devastating mental health disorder."
"9483343","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that can lead to bone marrow failure and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is characteristic of this disorder and, as such, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are often used to treat MDS in lieu of conventional chemotherapies that have proven to be ineffective for this disease. However, even with DMTi therapy, only about one third of MDS patients achieve a clinical response leading to a survival benefit. Moreover, current DMTi-based regimens for MDS require a minimum of 6 months of treatment before a patient can be deemed resistant to this therapy. Given that only ~30-40% of patients respond to this treatment, the majority of patients will spend 6 months receiving a therapy to which they are unlikely to respond. Therefore, the identification of molecular differences that distinguish between sensitive and resistant patients at the time of diagnosis is critical in order to harness these differences for the development of molecular biomarkers predictive of DMTi response. These biomarkers would allow us to more accurately risk-stratify these patients and prevent unwarranted and ineffective therapy for resistant patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology we performed genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression and mutational analysis on a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), an MDS/MPN overlap syndrome, including both sensitive and resistant patients to the DMTi Decitabine (DAC). We found that robust epigenetic and gene expression differences exist between DMTi responders and non-responders. From these differences, we were able to develop an epigenetic classifier that predicts response to decitabine therapy in these patients with 87% accuracy. Moreover, using RNA-seq we identified a gene expression signature associated with primary resistance to DAC in CMML. Based on these data, we hypothesize that comparable differences are likely to be found in MDS patients who are either sensitive or resistant to the DMTi Azacytidine (AZA), and that these too have the potential to be used as the basis of a molecular classifier of response as well as to identify mechanisms of primary resistance to the drug. We propose to perform genome-wide studies DNA methylation and expression studies in a cohort of 250 MDS patients treated with AZA in order to identify DNA methylation and expression biomarkers predictive of response to this agent in MDS. From these studies, we expect to be able to develop clinically useful biomarkers that can be translated to CLIA-compatible technologies that can be applied in molecular diagnostics labs."
"9443646","Project Summary The IMSD Graduate Fellows Program has had a dramatic impact on PhD-level training of Underrepresented (UR) students at The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). Since its inception in 1997, UR participation in supported departments (biology, chemistry, biochemistry, chemical/ mechanical engineering, human services psychology, and physics) has increased from 0%, 1%, 0%, 1%, 8%, and 0%, respectively, to 13%, 16%, 17%, 16%, 21%, and 3%, respectively. Expansion in 2007 to the Graduate Program in Life Science (GPILS) at our sister campus, the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB), triggered a near doubling in UR GPILS enrollment at UMB (from 22 students in 2007 to 39 students in 2014). Total IMSD enrollment continues to grow, with 87 IMSD PhD students enrolled in the Fall of 2015 (52 African American, 24 Hispanic, 1 Native American, 3 Pacific Islander, 1 Caucasian with disability, and 6 non-UR (1 declared- disadvantaged Caucasian male, 2 women of Middle Eastern descent, 1 East Indian, and 2 Asian)). Retention has reached an all-time high (90% in the current funding period; 87% over the past 10 years; 81% since inception), and UR PhD production has increased dramatically, from 7 UR PhD degrees awarded over the 15 years preceding IMSD to 78 total PhDs awarded to IMSD Fellows (32 since our last competitive renewal). Of the 78 graduates, 56 (72%) matriculated directly to Postdoctoral positions. Although nearly all of the quantitative objectives of the current support period have been met, significant challenges remain. In particular, although 20 former IMSD Fellow graduates obtained full- or part-time university/college faculty positions, and 5 additional postdocs are actively applying for tenure-track positions, only one former Fellow currently holds a tenure-track position. Since UR colleagues in tenured academic positions are likely to have the broadest impact as mentors and policy makers, and since the percentage of tenured UR faculty has remained flat for decades, we clearly must do a better job of preparing IMSD Fellows for negative pressures that are impacting their matriculation to tenure-track positions -- including published reports that UR students are less competitive for NIH funding, that the U.S. is producing too many PhDs, and that there are declining academic opportunities. In addition, UR participation in PhD programs at UMBC and UMB remains well below national population averages. Overall objectives include: (1) growth to 100+ enrolled Fellows while maintaining high retention, (2) expansion in STEM departments where UR participation has lagged, and (3) increase competitiveness for tenure-track faculty positions. New activities include: (i) mock study sections and workshops to improve grantsmanship, (ii) new individualized (using IDPs) and cohort-level advising activities, (iii) expansion of the IMSD speaker exchange, to increase exposure and match Fellows with like-minded postdoc advisors at supportive institutions, and (iv) expansion of K-12 outreach activities, to develop leadership skills and address critical mentorship needs in inner-city Baltimore that were brought to focus by the 2015 riots. 1"
"9667585","Project Summary Ethnic and racial minority young men who have sex with men (MYMSM) remain a critical population at the nexus of substance use and HIV/AIDS: a 132% increase in new infections concentrated among African American and Hispanic YMSM has been observed since 2002. The Young Men's Health Project (YMHP), a 4- session intervention utilizing motivational interviewing designed for HIV-negative or untested YMSM ages 18- 29 was found to be efficacious in significantly reducing substance use and condomless anal sex (CAS). To date, this is the first and only RCT of any published trial or CDC DEBI with YMSM to show significant reductions in both substance use and sexual risk. The CDC recently rated YMHP as ?Best Evidence? and placed it on the compendium of Evidence Based Interventions and Best Practices for HIV Prevention. YMHP was tested through an efficacy trial in a research center environment with numerous inclusion and exclusion criteria, and thus, a community-based replication is the crucial next step in studying the intervention's effectiveness in the real world when delivered by staff to their clients. We will conduct a comparative effectiveness trial (CET) with two intensities of treatment offered following field-based HIV counseling and testing (C&T) ? the YMHP intervention and enhanced ?treatment as usual? (eTAU) HIV prevention services ? in two real-world community based organizations (CBOs) to test their relative effectiveness in reducing substance use and CAS among HIV-negative MYMSM. The Specific Aims are to: 1) adapt the YMHP intervention for delivery in CBOs by peer counselors; 2) test the effectiveness of the YMHP intervention when delivered by peer counselors at two CBOs situated in high HIV incidence neighborhoods in New York City; and 3) assess the cost-effectiveness of YMHP relative to TAU. The proposed study will be implemented over two phases. In Phase 1 we will conduct qualitative research with staff at our collaborating agencies to adapt the efficacious YMHP intervention to the unique needs of MYMSM and incorporate existing systems and approaches utilized by site collaborators to facilitate for delivery by peer counselors. In Phase 2 we will randomize 260 HIV-negative substance using MYMSM into the YMHP intervention or eTAU. Assessments will include behavioral self-report measures, urine testing for substance use, and HIV and STI testing for sexual health outcomes. Working together with our CBO collaborators will help to address practical problems at the frontline of service provision to pave the way for a comprehensive program to reduce substance use and HIV infection among MYMSM. If effective, our program has the potential to exert a sustained and powerful influence on the effectiveness of behavioral interventions for economically disadvantaged, substance using MYMSM who are most at risk for HIV infection."
"9480087","Title: Role of microRNA molecules in therapeutic response to leukotriene modifying agents in asthma. The Principal Investigator, Dr. Amber Dahlin, Ph.D., MMSc., is committed to becoming an independent investigator focusing on highly innovative, translational, patient-oriented research in asthma. Her long-term goal is to identify, develop and implement new knowledge and methods to improve therapeutic outcomes for reducing the burden of asthma worldwide. The goal of this project is to identify the microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes that contribute to leukotriene modifier response in asthmatics. Although miRNAs are known to affect immune response pathways related to asthma, few studies to date have examined the role of these molecules on asthma development, progression and management. miRNAs are yet to be directly implicated in the clinical response to leukotriene modifiers, or in asthma subtypes including aspirin associated respiratory disease (AERD), which is characterized by excessive production of leukotrienes. In this revised application, Dr. Dahlin proposes to identify miRNAs, and their targets, associated with pharmacological and clinical response to montelukast in a cellular model of leukotriene perturbation using immortalized B cells from asthmatic patients, in addition to sera and primary B cells from a case-controlled AERD patient cohort, and then integrate the these data using bioinformatic approaches to construct predictive network models of montelukast response. Understanding the role of miRNA networks will enhance the pursuit of effective therapeutic outcomes in asthma treatment and provides a unique opportunity to reduce public health burden. Working closely with her mentor, Dr. Scott Weiss at Harvard Medical School, while completing these studies, she will also build her skills as a PI in personalized medicine through taking relevant coursework, attending meetings and conferences, and meeting with her collaborative clinical research team. Her committed mentors and collaborators will support her submission of an R01 grant proposal in the final years of this award period. In September 2014, Dr. Dahlin was promoted to the faculty rank of Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School, demonstrating the institution?s commitment to her career development. This NHLBI Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will allow Dr. Dahlin to merge a translational epidemiological approach with network modeling to investigate the relationship between miRNA networks and treatment response in asthma, with the goal of improving therapeutic outcomes for asthma patients."
"9497763","Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by widespread  inflammation and development of autoantibodies against nucleic acids (NAs). SLE pathogenesis is not fully  understood but genomic studies support an interplay between innate and adaptive immunity. Pathogenic  loops involving immune complex(IC)-containing NAs that activate innate immune cells such as dendritic  cells (DCs), platelets and neutrophils through the endosomal TLR pathway result in plasmacytoid DC (pDC)  activation and release of type I IFN. Excessive production and/or sensing of NAs is emerging as a  fundamental and upstream event in SLE, and over-expression of IFN-inducible transcriptional signatures is  a universal finding, especially in early onset SLE. We and others recently reported that neutrophils release  DNA-protein complexes that activate pDCs, thus acting as Danger-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs).  DAMPS are extruded upon neutrophil activation with SLE immune complexes (ICs) and directly activate  pDCs in an FcR-independent and TLR9-dependent manner. Our preliminary data now show that these  DAMPs are composed of damaged (oxidized) mitochondrial DNA-protein complexes (mtDAMPs) released  upon type I IFN and anti-Sm/RNP mediated endosomal TLR7 activation of neutrophils. This combination of  stimuli impairs the detoxification of oxidized mtDNA through lysosomal degradation, which is a fundamental  step leading to the extrusion of interferogenic mtDAMPs. Here, we propose 1) to characterize the basic  mechanisms that lead to neutrophil mitochondrial damage and release of mtDAMPs in SLE, 2) to identify  the interferogenic components of mtDAMPs and the mechanisms responsible for their internalization in  pDCs, and 3) to characterize the effects of SLE mtDAMPs on non-hemopoietic cells that become the target  of inflammation in SLE, especially endothelial cells. Overall, these studies will provide a better  understanding of how breakdown of tolerance to NAs and dysregulation of the IFN pathway are  interconnected and amplify each other. These studies will bring novel insight into SLE autoantibody  pathogenic roles and perpetuation of IFN-amplification loops"
"9470868","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decisions about whether to build new public transportation projects need to consider how these major investments impact public health. However, to date, research on these impacts has been scarce. To inform future policy making, we propose to evaluate the effects of a new light rail line on health outcomes and health care costs among members of an integrated health plan in Portland, Oregon. We will examine longitudinal data on health biomarkers and health care costs among 4,000 health plan members and matched controls before and after the opening of a new light rail line in 2015. By linking individual behavior, health, and health care costs to parcel-level data on retail outlets, street characteristics, and active transportation infrastructure, we propose to conduct the most comprehensive, robust evaluation of a large-scale community infrastructure improvement to date. We will determine, prospectively, the effect of opening a new light rail line on changes in clinical health measures and health care costs between baseline and three years after the line opens. We will recruit Kaiser Permanente Northwest members aged 18-74 years living within 1.5 km of the new rail line stations; these cases (N=4000) will be compared to a control group (N=4000) matched at the census block group level on demographics, walkability, and transit accessibility. Health measures will include body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, blood lipids, and glycosylated hemoglobin from the electronic medical record (EMR). We will also determine the degree to which any observed changes in health status and costs in the intervention group are mediated by changes in transportation-associated and total physical activity (PA), controlling for walkability (local accessibility), crime and safety measures, pedestrian, bike, recreational infrastructure, and socioeconomic status. This will be done by objectively assessing at baseline and two-year follow up total PA (using accelerometry data) and transportation PA (GPS data), in a randomly selected subsample of 500 exposed and 500 control group members. This study could have a substantial impact on public health policy. Considerable political resistance to increasing public transportation still exists; establishing the health effects and costs of such infrastructure will inform cost-benefit models used to prioritize transportation investments. The rich health and environmental data that our study will yield will enhance public understanding of the ways in which transit investment impacts physical activity and health care costs. This critical information is currently lacking from decision- making about major public transportation investments."
"9484149","PROJECT SUMMARY Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Among the several cell types and processes involved in atherogenesis, the role of macrophages in the formation of high-risk plaques is well established and characterized. The past 15 years have seen tremendous efforts to develop and validate non-invasive imaging to quantify plaque macrophages and improve CVD patients management. Even nowadays, the role of imaging continues to be advocated to better define atherosclerosis and to improve assessment of therapeutic regimens.18F-FDG PET is a non-invasive, translational imaging technique widely used and validated to quantify plaque macrophages in vivo. However, vascular 18F-FDG PET still carries several important limitations. For example, while 18F-FDG vessel wall accumulation has been consistently correlated to plaque inflammation, uptake is not specific for macrophages, and can be influenced by other factors, such as hypoxia and vascular density. To overcome these limitations, several novel PET tracers more specific to unique molecules, receptors and cells involved in plaque inflammation are currently being investigated. 68Ga-DOTATATE is a novel PET tracer, recently approved by the FDA to improve detection of somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) -positive neuroendocrine tumors. SSTR2s are also overexpressed on activated plaque macrophages. Preliminary studies have found 68Ga-DOTATATE to accumulate in macrophage-rich plaques in atherosclerotic mice. Retrospective analyses have confirmed accumulation in the atherosclerotic vessel wall in cancer patients. Building on these previous studies, we propose to establish and translate 68Ga-DOTATATE as a specific, non-invasive marker of atherosclerotic plaque macrophages. In parallel with mechanistic studies in atherosclerotic mice on PET/CT, we will translate 68Ga-DOTATATE PET on a combined PET/MR scanner in large animals (rabbits) and patients with coronary atherosclerosis. 68Ga-DOTATATE may be particularly useful when imaging this challenging vascular territory, where 18F-FDG PET is notoriously difficult because of the strong, non-specific myocardial background uptake. Our laboratory is deeply involved in translational PET/MRI for imaging of coronary atherosclerosis, by developing innovative motion correction, partial volume correction algorithms and dynamic PET imaging to improve PET tracers uptake in the coronary arteries (R01 HL071021, PI Fayad). We anticipate that establishing 68Ga-DOTATATE PET may allow improving the management of CVD patients, the quantitative assessment of novel anti-atherosclerotic compounds, and, in the future, prove useful to improve diagnosis of other CVD conditions. While beyond the scope of our work, this proposal is the basis for more extensive, prospective clinical trials investigating the predictive value of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET and other promising imaging markers for CVD events."
"9605856","Studying complex neurological function and disease requires imaging technologies that can provide a comprehensive view of the mammalian brain with high spatiotemporal resolution. Ideally, these technologies should be scalable from small brain regions in rodents to whole-brain imaging in larger organisms such as non- human primates. They should provide access to endogenous signals such as hemodynamics, and be able to image neuron-specific signals such as calcium and activity-dependent gene expression using targeted reporters. They should also be compatible with freely moving subjects to enable behavioral studies, and should allow simultaneous electrophysiology and targeted modulation. Finally, they should be non-invasive or minimally invasive to enable the possibility of future clinical translation. No existing technology fulfills these criteria because optical and electrophysiological techniques face inherent limitations in scaling, while functional magnetic resonance imaging has relatively low spatiotemporal resolution and severely constrains behavioral paradigms. Recently, functional ultrasound was introduced as a revolutionary technique that can image neural activity non-invasively with more than an order of magnitude improved spatiotemporal resolution compared to fMRI (<100µm and <10ms), using transducers that can be mounted on freely moving animals. In rodents, fUS has been used to image activity patterns associated with epileptic seizures, whisker stimulation, olfactory perception and resting state connectivity, and studies are underway to demonstrate the use of fUS in larger animals and pediatric patients. In its present form, fUS tracks changes in blood flow arising from neurovascular coupling. While this already provides unprecedented brain imaging performance, it is limited by the relatively low strength of intrinsic hemodynamic signals and the lack of reporters to connect ultrasound more directly to neural activity. Here, we propose to take the next major leap in ultrasonic functional imaging of the brain by developing biomolecular imaging agents that enhance fUS signals by more than two orders of magnitude and enable direct imaging of activity-dependent gene expression and calcium signaling in genetically targeted neurons. As part of this work, we will also demonstrate the ability of fUS to image brain activity in non-human primates in combination with electrical recording and pharmacological modulation. If we are successful in these goals, the resulting technology will provide neuroscience researchers with truly revolutionary capabilities, especially for the study of larger animal models. Furthermore, the potential merger of of this technology with ultrasonic neuromodulation (which uses a different regime of frequencies and intensities) will open the possibility of all-acoustic interfaces to simultaneously image and control neural activity in freely moving subjects."
"9483256","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Somatosensory neurons project peripheral axons to the skin early in development to detect touch stimuli. Although the cutaneous terminals of these axons are often a proportionally small component of the total peripheral axon length, they are critical for function, since they are the sites where touch stimuli are first detected. Cutaneous axon endings are particularly vulnerable to damage by injury, diabetes, and inherited syndromes, notably Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases. All of these conditions cause debilitating peripheral neuropathies characterized by chronic pain or the inability to sense touch. Characterizing how cutaneous sensory endings are formed, maintained, and respond to injury is thus essential for understanding these conditions and developing effective treatments. We have developed a larval zebrafish model to study the development of somatosensory peripheral axons and the skin cells that they innervate. Because zebrafish larvae are fertilized externally, develop rapidly, and are optically clear, the zebrafish somatosensory system offers unparalleled experimental access to the early stages of skin innervation. By contrast, studying these cutaneous sensory terminals in mammals is challenging, since they develop in utero and their complete three-dimensional structures are difficult to visualize. Most anatomical and molecular features of somatosensory axon territories in the skin are well conserved from fish to mammals, making zebrafish a relevant model for uncovering potential disease mechanisms. Our studies of the past few years have revealed that skin cells play several critical roles in the development, repair and function of somatosensory axon terminals in the skin. The goal of this proposal is to identify and characterize the molecular dialogues between axons and skin cells that regulate the establishment and maintenance of somatosensory axon territories. Using a unique and powerful set of molecular techniques and transgenic tools that we have developed in recent years, we will investigate three questions about the nature of axon/skin interactions during specific stages of somatosensory neuron ontogeny. First, how are sensory axons guided to the skin? Second, once in the skin how do axons become structurally associated with skin cells? And third, how does the skin respond to axon damage and contribute to repair? We will address these questions with a powerful combination of live imaging, embryology and molecular perturbations. Collectively, these studies will provide the first molecular insight into the regulation of several newly discovered functions of skin cells in the development and maintenance of the somatosensory system."
"9454490","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the South Carolina Research Center for Recovery from Stroke (SCRCRS) is to enable outstanding multidisciplinary collaborative research in recovery from stroke. Stroke is of unique importance to South Carolina as a disproportionate rate of incidence results in undue economic/social burdens from post-stroke disability. Our organizing concept is that better understanding of the experience-dependent nature of neural plasticity will allow us to investigate and exploit inherent neural recovery processes, develop and translate novel mechanism- based interventional strategies, and ultimately improve the function and quality of life of individuals recovering from stroke. The specific aims are to: 1) train and mentor a cadre of junior scientists who are skilled in multiple domains; 2) develop innovative scientific core resources designed to advance stroke recovery research in animal and human studies; and 3) promote the long-term viability of the SCRCRS through development of multidisciplinary translational research programs and rigorous evaluation and improvement strategies.          The Center is led by a multidisciplinary team, comprised of a PhD biomedical engineer/biomechanical scientist and an MD/clinical stroke expert, coalescing resources and disciplines from schools of medicine and allied health sciences.

"9476205","Project 1 Project Summary/Abstract  Abnormal deposits of tau protein in neurons along with extracellular neuritic plaques containing fibrillar amyloid are the pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) measures of amyloid can detect abnormalities years to decades before clinical symptoms develop, but pathologic tau in the brain and CSF is more closely related to neuronal injury and death (neurodegeneration) than pathologic amyloid. Very recently, a novel 18F-labeled PET tracer targeting pathologic tau, T807, has shown great promise for detecting the amount and locations of abnormal tau deposition in the brains of living persons which was not previously possible. Validation of this new technology is needed to determine how well it works for detecting tau pathology and how it compares with existing CSF measures. In the long term, PET studies with T807 may be used to accelerate the development of therapies for AD by identifying individuals at high risk for near-term or ongoing neuronal injury who may benefit the most from therapy and by measuring response to these therapies during clinical trials based on decreasing brain T807 binding on serial imaging studies.  This proposal focuses on the necessary next steps to compare T807-PET measures with existing CSF markers of tau. We will take advantage of well-characterized, biomarker-defined individuals through the Knight ADRC to perform T807-PET studies in groups of participants across the spectrum of AD ranging from normal controls to early AD dementia. The amount of brain T807 binding will be compared to amounts of CSF tau biomarkers measured in each individual, and the ability of these PET and CSF measures to predict cognitive status at baseline and 2-4 years later will be compared. In a subset of these participants, we will repeat T807- PET imaging (and CSF collection) to assess how rapidly T807 binding changes over time in asymptomatic individuals with and without abnormal CSF amyloid. We hypothesize that higher brain T807 binding will occur in those with more advanced AD pathology and will predict greater cognitive impairment and decline than those with lower brain T807 binding. This study will be conducted through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Examine the association among T807-PET measures of PHF-tau, concentrations of CSF biomarkers, and cognitive performance. Aim 2. Characterize the amount and spatial distribution of T807-PET measures in healthy aging, preclinical AD, and early symptomatic AD. Aim 3 (Discovery): Evaluate the change in T807-PET measures over time in asymptomatic amyloid-positive individuals and its association with changes in concentrations of CSF biomarkers."
"9520323","Project Summary/Abstract ?TR&D 2 Increased specimen throughput, demanded by the DBP Investigators and produced by TR&D1, must be accompanied by improvements in data processing and the overall data analysis pipeline.

We will achieve this goal by replacing labor-intensive processes with automated, or semi- automated methods. In addition to increasing throughput, automated methods open NCXT technologies and data to autonomous non-expert users. To accommodate higher specimen throughput and correlated imaging experiments with increasing complexity we will also improve our specimen and data tracking system.

"9495761","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT G4C2 repeat expansions in C9ORF72 are the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Success in developing a treatment for ?c9FTD/ALS? will require a better understanding of disease pathomechanisms, rigorous testing of r(G4C2)exp-binding compounds in pre- clinical models, and the development of pharmacodynamic and clinical biomarkers. Putative pathomechanisms of ?c9FTD/ALS? involve RNA transcribed from the expansion [r(G4C2)exp]. We have shown these transcripts serve as templates for the synthesis of ?c9RAN proteins? through repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation. That neuronal inclusions of c9RAN proteins are a pathological hallmark of c9FTD/ALS implicates RAN translation as a mechanism of disease. Indeed, poly(GR) and poly(PR) c9RAN proteins cause nucleocytoplasmic transport defects in yeast, and our studies reveal nuclear pore protein pathology in poly(GA)-expressing mice. These findings are consistent with those demonstrating that C9ORF72 repeat expansions impair nucleocytoplasmic transport and provoke atypical gene expression in c9FTD/ALS patient- derived cell models. Of note, we found extensive transcriptome changes in the brains of c9ALS patients, including abnormal alternative splicing of genes involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Whether this RNA misregulation is caused by c9RAN proteins and/or other events associated with r(G4C2)exp, and whether these transcriptome defects underlie the development of TDP-43 pathology, a hallmark feature of c9FTD/ALS argued to be a primary cause of neurodegeneration, are questions of importance that we will investigate. In addition, we will evaluate the therapeutic benefit of neutralizing r(G4C2)exp; together with leaders of Projects 1 and 3, we have shown that small molecule binders of r(G4C2)exp mitigate c9FTD/ALS-associated defects in patient- derived cell models. Therefore, we will screen r(G4C2)exp probes emerging from Project 1 in c9FTD/ALS patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines, and those showing promise will be screened in c9FTD/ALS iPSN by Project 3. Ultimately, we will validate lead compounds in our (G4C2)66 mice, yet another crucial step in moving drugs towards clinical trials. Likewise, because testing potential therapies in clinical trials will demand reliable, efficient means to measure target engagement and patient responses to treatment, and because there is an urgent need for indicators of c9FTD/ALS prognosis and disease stage, we will evaluate whether poly(GP) c9RAN proteins can serve these purposes. Our exciting findings that poly(GP) proteins are detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood lymphocytes from c9FTD/ALS patients, coupled with preliminary data suggesting that CSF poly(GP) levels associate with clinical features of disease, provide compelling support for the use of poly(GP) as a biomarker of c9FTD/ALS. Overall, through the pre-clinical validation of lead small molecules and the development of clinical and pharmacodynamic biomarkers, Project 2 aims to increase the likelihood of success in identifying an effective treatment for c9FTD/ALS patients."
"9454497","Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in the United States. It is well established that poor motor rehabilitation outcomes are associated with elevated neural activity in the contralesional hemisphere when stroke patients are using their affected limb. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the neurobiologic basis for this elevated activity in the contralesional primary motor cortex in these patients. It is possible that this elevated activity is due to changes in cortical excitability within the contralesional hemisphere (tested in Aim 1) as well as alterations in signal conduction between the hemispheres (tested in Aim 2). In addition to examining the contribution of within and between hemisphere signaling to elevated neural activity in the contralesional hemisphere, we will also determine the extent to which these neurobiological factors contribute to clinically relevant outcomes - such as unimanual and bimanual motor performance (Aim 3). We will use a multimodal approach (including brain imaging/brain stimulation (Interleaved TMS/BOLD imaging), magnetic resonance spectroscopy and clinical assessment) to address these Aims in a cross-sectional cohort design of hemiparetic chronic stroke patients with right-sided upper extremity weakness subsequent to a left hemisphere cortical stroke, as well as a group of neurologically healthy, age-matched controls. The results of these Aims will clarify the relative contribution of within and between hemisphere adaptations to cortical reorganization. These data will provide a foundation a longitudinal R01 that will determine which patterns of laterality predict favorable treatment outcomes, and will also add to the basic science interpretation of Dr. Malcolm (Project 2) and Dr. Feng's (Project 3) SCRCRS projects."
"9260357","OVERALL: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Berkeley Superfund Research Center, in consultation with the Program's key stakeholders, has identified four complex problems associated with hazardous waste sites that have proven intractable to current methods. These problems are how to better assess: 1) cumulative impacts from multiple environmental stressors (e.g. chemical exposures, stress and obesity); 2) past exposures, especially early-life exposures and their contribution to risk; 3) the effects of chemical mixtures and their impact on remediation efforts; and, 4) the complex transformation of chemicals to reactive intermediates and their ability to act through multiple mechanistic pathways. Here we propose six interactive projects (4 biomedical and 2 engineering) and 5 cores that aim to address these four problems though original research, translation to appropriate end-users and community engagement efforts. We will focus on exposures to high priority chemicals commonly found at Superfund sites, including arsenic, benzene, trichloroethene, formaldehyde, chromium and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to address the specific mandates of the Program. We will, however, take a novel approach in adopting the so-called `exposome paradigm' in our research. This new paradigm, which we helped develop, allows for a `seeing the whole picture' approach to risk assessment, hazard identification and the safe and effective remediation of hazardous sites containing multiple chemicals. In the exposome paradigm all non- genetic environmental stressors are considered as environmental exposures. Therefore, cumulative risk assessment, where the impact of all stressors on a population is assessed, could be operationalized by exposomics. Communities living near sites face cumulative risks from a variety of environmental and social factors. The theme of our Center is therefore the exposome and we propose a step-wise approach to applying exposomics to help solve the complex problems found at Superfund sites. Biomedical Projects 1-4 aim to develop advanced techniques for the detection, assessment, and evaluation of the effects and risk to human health of hazardous substances; Engineering Project 5 will develop methods to detect new hazardous substances in the environment and together with Engineering Project 6 will develop methods to reduce the amount and toxicity of hazardous substances. A Community Engagement Core C (CEC) will address contaminated drinking water problems in California in collaboration with Projects 1, 5 and 6 and Core E, a Data Science and Laboratory Core that will assist researchers and the CEC in meeting their goals. A Research Translation Core C will facilitate interactions between investigators and key stakeholders and a Training Core D will develop the next generation of multidisciplinary professionals. The overall goal is to enhance understanding of the relationship between exposure and disease; provide usable tools to improve human health risk assessments; and, develop a range of prevention and remediation strategies to protect public health and the environment. The program will be overseen and coordinated by an Administration Core A."
"9476880","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse is common among adolescents. Unfortunately, alcohol abuse during this vulnerable period of brain development can lead to long-term molecular and behavioral changes. A growing body of research suggests a role for microglia - the resident macrophages of the brain - in the detrimental effects of alcohol. This proposal outlines experiments to determine the long-term effects of adolescent alcohol on microglia and the role of microglia in the long-term effects of adolescent alcohol. Microglia normally exist in a resting state, but in response to insults can undergo activation. There are multiple types of microglial activation, each with different functional outcomes that range from destructive to reparative. Activation is frequently associated with increases in microglial markers, although this does not always indicate what functional changes have taken place. Previous studies find that adolescent alcohol treatment increases levels of microglial marker CD11b, an integrin component involved in process reorganization. However, increased CD11b does not indicate what functional changes - either toxic or healing - AIE has caused in the microglia. Aim 1 will investigate the long- term effects of adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) treatment on microglial functional changes. Rats will be treated with AIE and microglia will be isolated during adulthood. Techniques such as flow cytometry, RT-PCR and ELISA will be used to assess changes in microglial markers and expression of pro-inflammatory and anti- inflammatory cytokines. Aim 2 will investigate the long-term effects of AIE on the microglial response to activating stimuli. Increased microglial markers such as CD11b are indicative of a phenomenon known as priming. When microglial are primed, they exhibit an enhanced response to activating stimuli. Various stimuli, such as stress and systemic inflammation, can activate microglia. Rats will be treated with AIE and challenged with either acute stress or systemic inflammation during adulthood. Immunohistochemistry will be used to examine the long-term effects of AIE on the microglial response to these activating stimuli. Lastly, Aim 3 will determine the role of microglia in the long-term effects of AIE. A microglial inhibitor, ibudilast, will be administered during AIE treatment. Molecular and behavioral changes caused by AIE, such as increased brain neuroimmune proteins, increased anxiety, and decreased cognitive function will be examined during adulthood. These studies will address important unanswered questions about the consequences of adolescent alcohol abuse. Very little is known about the long-term effects of adolescent alcohol on microglia or the contributions of microglia to the long-term effects of adolescent alcohol. The results have potential to change the way we think about the neurobiology of adolescent alcohol abuse. Given the widespread extent of adolescent alcohol abuse, these studies could help guide preventative strategies, or provide potential targets for pharmacotherapy."
"9474220","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obsessive-compulsive behaviors (OCB) are common in children and adolescents. In addition to being the core features of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), OCB are often associated in youth with tic, grooming, generalized anxiety, and autistic spectrum disorders. This competitive renewal application combines the unique clinical assessment, magnetic resonance imaging, and genetics expertise of three performance sites: Wayne State University (WSU), University of Michigan (UM), and the Hospital for Sick Children, affiliated with the University of Toronto (UT). The overall goal of this project - which extends prior and existing NIMH-funded research including Drs. Rosenberg and Diwadkar's neurodiagnostic imaging-genetic studies (K24MH02037; R01MH59299), Dr. Hanna's family, molecular genetic, and action monitoring studies (R01MH53876; R01MH59299; K20MH01065; R01MH101493) and Dr. Arnold and colleagues' extensive genetic studies in pediatric OCD (R01MH59299; R01MH101493) - is to exploit the emerging field of imaging genetics to 1) determine the relationship between alterations in functional connectivity of fronto-striatal-thalamic circuitry (FSTC) as measured by task and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and childhood OCB; 2) identify common, rare, and novel genetic variants associated with alterations in connectivity of FSTC as measured by fMRI; 3) clarify whether fMRI measured alterations in FSTC are potential intermediate phenotypes of OCB by determining whether they mediate the effects of genetic variants on OCB; and 4) combine structural MRI data from this study and our previous imaging genetics study to identify genetic variants associated with anterior cingulate volume and other FSTC structures in 1000 youth. The Child Behavior Checklist Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CBCL-OCS) shows substantial heritability in pediatric twin studies. Heritability of structural and functional abnormalities in STC has also been demonstrated in OCD patients and their unaffected relatives. By using a research design consistent with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), targeted high field (3 Tesla) fMRI at WSU will be combined with comprehensive genomic assessment in 200 child psychiatric outpatients with CBCL-OCS scores = 5, 200 child psychiatric outpatients with CBL-OCS scores < 5, and 200 matched healthy controls aged 8-18 years. We will examine for common and rare genomic variants associated with FSTC dysregulation and conduct whole genome sequencing (WGS) in 60 subjects with FSTC dysregulation in the highest 10% of the distribution and compare to 60 subjects with FSTC dysregulation in the lowest 10% of the distribution to identify rare and novel variants of possible clinical significance. This unique study enacts the call for translational approaches to mental illness outlined in PAR- 14-165 by examining multiple genomic variants in FSTC in a spectrum of common but understudied disorders in youth. Our work will provide a better understanding of the impact of genetic variants on FSTC dysregulation in the pathogenesis of OCB and lead to new diagnostic, treatment, and prevention strategies."
"9481717","Summary: The Preclinical Assessment Core will be comprised of three components: a hemodynamic subcore, an imaging subcore, and a Biobank housing biological samples collected from an unique non-human primate model of pulmonary arterial hypertension secondary to humanized simian immunodeficiency virus infection (SIV-PAH) established and characterized in the previous funding cycle of the tPPG. All three components are essential for the mechanistic and translational research goals of this tPPG application. Specific Aims: The specific aims of the Preclinical Assessment Core are: 1.To provide expertise in novel hemodynamic assessments of pulmonary hypertension and cardiac function in mouse and rat models of PAH and pulmonary hypertension with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (PH-HFpEF). 2. To provide expertise in imaging-based studies for mechanistic and pathologic assessment of PAH and PH-HFpEF rodent models. 3. To develop a Biobank from the primate model of SIV-PAH. Core Services/Research Plan: The Hemodynamic subcore will provide assistance in the implementation of rodent animal models of PAH and PH-HFpEF, biventricular hemodynamic assessment by Doppler flow and pressure-volume measurements, and echocardiographic measurements for non-invasive evaluation of cardiac structure and function in rodents with PAH and PH-HFpEF. The Imaging component will provide expertise in the preparation, storage and immuno-labeling of tissues in living and fixed samples from animal models. These will include identification of key signaling pathways and characterization of disease pathology and progression by quantitative measures of pulmonary vascular and heart remodeling using image analysis approaches. The Core will provide access to a Biobank of lung, heart tissue, pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC), plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage, and fecal samples from different time points of the SIV-PAH primate model that will allow functional correlations and mechanistic studies from early to advanced stages of the disease. PASMC will be used to develop an in vitro model to evaluate the effect of metabolic disorders and therapeutic candidates in PASMC proliferation. Significance and synergy: The Preclinical core will support studies in animal models of PAH and PH-HFpEF that closely recapitulate the pathogenesis and clinical outcome of human disease, and more importantly, have proven value in evaluating new therapies. All Projects will use resources of the Preclinical Assessment Core to: 1) test mechanistic hypotheses of the pathogenesis of PAH and PH-HFpEF, 2) test the efficacy of new therapeutics in established rodent models of PAH and PH-HFpEF, and 3) evaluate molecular mechanisms in biological samples from the SIV-PAH model. In addition, the Preclinical Core will synergize with the repository of human samples from the Clinical Core to serve as an integrated resource for validation of pulmonary hypertension target molecules as well as mechanistic pathways."
"9487147","Project Summary The biological springs that act in parallel and in series with skeletal muscle can significantly influence the force, power and displacement of muscle fibers during locomotion. All movements involve dynamic interactions between passive elastic structures and muscle contractile elements, but our understanding of the consequences of this interaction for both normal and pathological gait is limited. Our long-term goal is to define the mechanical influence of elastic elements on muscle force production and gait. This project aims to understand how the mechanical interaction between internal muscle elastic elements and forces produced by muscle fibers define the gear ratio with which muscles operate. Previous work shows that this interaction significantly influences muscle force and speed, and we hypothesize that the influence of internal elastic elements on muscle shape changes underlies deficits in muscle performance in aging and many neuromuscular disorders. The project aims to construct and test a model of muscle shape change that can predict the influence of muscle force and muscle elastic properties on the gear ratio with which pennate muscles produce force. This project combines unique animal model systems with novel measurement techniques to make direct measurements of muscle force, muscle shape, and fiber length change both in vivo and in isolated muscles. The specific aims of the project are: 1) to develop a predictive model of muscle shape change and gearing 2) to use a series of studies of muscle function in vivo and in situ to test and refine this model; 3) to test the hypothesis that external constraints can influence muscle force output via their effect on muscle bulging, and 4) to test the hypothesis that restrictions to muscle bulging due to stiffened extracellular matrix reduce muscle force output in aged muscles. Changes in the elastic properties of connective tissue elements within muscle are associated with several neuromuscular disorders, aging, and occur secondarily to stroke and spinal cord injury. A fundamental understanding of the influence of these elements on muscle mechanical function will inform the design of rehabilitative strategies and interventions to improve muscle- tendon function. An improved understanding of how muscle elastic elements influence the mechanical behavior of healthy muscle-tendon units may also aid in the design of prosthetic devices."
"9473774","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis), prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are important public health problems as they are highly prevalent and their treatment is both difficult and expensive. Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and periodontal disease are known to be strongly correlated. A large body of evidence suggests these correlations are causal and bidirectional. While diabetes is a generally well- accepted risk factor for the development of periodontal disease, classical bidirectional hypotheses only suggest periodontal disease to contribute to poor glycemic control among patients with established diabetes. However, in this proposal we hypothesize that dysbiotic subgingival microbial communities common in periodontal disease (i.e., periodontal infections) might contribute to insulin resistance and future development of prediabetes among initially diabetes-free individuals. Recent work by our group and others provides strong support for this hypothesis. Nevertheless, several limitations exist limiting causal inference and obscuring future research directions. First, temporality is unclear due to cross-sectional designs. Second, no study to date has comprehensively assessed the subgingival microbiome as it relates to prediabetes. Third, the potential role of inflammation as a mediator of associations between subgingival microbiota and prediabetes has not been examined in longitudinal studies. We will enroll and follow longitudinally 1,400 diabetes-free individuals to examine the co-evolution of the subgingival microbiome and the development of prediabetes. This will allow us to test hypotheses about the potentially bidirectional association between periodontal infection and impaired glucose regulation early in the natural history of both disease processes and well before the development of overt diabetes. This investigation will also generate important knowledge necessary for optimizing the design of future intervention studies. Specifically, future RCT designs will be optimized by knowledge about microbial community characteristics and inflammatory phenotypes associated with prediabetes risk, to ensure that susceptible individuals are enrolled and anti-infective treatment goals are achieved."
"9693563","Project Summary/Abstract Propensity toward relapse is a hallmark feature of addiction. Hence, understanding the cellular mechanisms responsible for relapse vulnerability represents an important focus of addiction research. One significant and long-lasting cellular adaptation observed in response to multiple drugs of abuse is downregulation of astroglial glutamate transporter GLT-1. However, relatively very little is known about how drug self-administration affects astrocytes beyond GLT-1 expression, or how astrocytes may contribute to mechanisms of drug seeking. Results collected during the preceding K99/R00 award indicate that restored expression of GLT-1 is pivotal to the mechanism of action of multiple compounds that reduce behavioral measures of relapse in the rat self- administration and reinstatement model of addiction. Preliminary data also indicate that downregulation of GLT-1 by cocaine is accompanied by reduced expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and a retraction of astrocytes in the nucleus accumbens core. Astrocyte retraction is characterized by decreased surface area, volume, and decreased synaptic contacts. This finding represents a heretofore-unappreciated fundamental consequence of cocaine use on astrocyte cell biology. Thus, decreased GLT-1 expression is a component of larger-scale adaptions in astrocyte biology that occur following chronic cocaine use. These findings have led to the hypothesis that astrocyte retraction in the nucleus accumbens of cocaine-withdrawn rats contributes to synaptic adaptations that drive cocaine seeking. In order to test this hypothesis, the specific goals of this proposal are: (1) to determine when during the addiction cycle the morphological effects on astrocytes are induced (2) to determine the functional relationship between astrocyte retraction and synaptic adaptations believed to underlie cocaine seeking, and (3) to determine the relationship between astrocyte retraction and drug seeking after cessation of drug use. These questions will be addressed by combining rat cocaine self-administration with behavioral measures of cocaine seeking, high-resolution imaging of fluorescently labeled astrocytes, and whole cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. These studies will provide novel insight into how cocaine-dependent adaptations in astrocyte dynamics contribute to the cellular and behavioral pathologies characteristic of psychostimulant addiction. These studies will also provide important information toward the translational potential of astrocytes as a pharmacotherapeutic target for substance use disorders."
"9492358","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations in bone stem cells can impair bone metabolism and regeneration. Osteogenesis imperfect (OI) is the most common form of genetic bone disease and characterized by bone fragility with clinical manifestations varying from a mild increase in fractures to severe bone deformities and death. Individuals with OI have mutations that alter procollagen structure or production and lead to abnormal collagen fibril formation disrupting bone development and renewal. Treatment options for OI are limited and do not alleviate the complications seen in OI. Our recent work has demonstrated that AAV gene targeting vectors can disrupt the mutant collagen alleles that cause OI and that targeted cells produced normal collagen and formed bone. While these results indicate the effectiveness of genomic editing with targeting frequencies approaching 1%, an enhancement of AAV gene targeting is required to provide more robust in vivo genetic manipulations. Here we will expand upon our successes and propose three lines of investigations to develop a therapeutic approach for patients with inherited bone disease. First we will modify collagen genes using a CRISPR-AAV system that will allow for the disruption or correction of genes that cause OI in vivo. Second, we will investigate whether genetically corrected bone stem cells have a growth advantage in vivo and how TGF-beta signaling affects the extra-skeletal manifestations of bone disease. Finally we will conduct a series of experiments in a preclinical rabbit model to establish the optimal gene targeting delivery protocol. Successful completion of this proposal will lead to an improved understand of TGF-beta signaling and stem cell kinetics in bone and advance AAV gene targeting toward a clinical trial."

However, treatment for opioid addiction is failing; 80% of patients relapse to daily opioid use within 1 year9. Despite the prominent role of chronic pain in opioid addiction, no empirically-developed integrated treatments address these co-morbid functionally related problems.10-12  This R34 proposal, ?Advancing STOP: Self-regulation/CBT Therapy for Opioid addiction and Pain? in response to PA-13-078, ?Behavioral and Integrative Treatment Development Program,? seeks to modify and further evaluate our innovative Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)+Self Regulation group therapy protocol (Self-regulation/CBT Therapy for Opioid addiction and Pain: STOP) initially developed from PI?s NIDA K-23 human laboratory findings on the psychological and physiological responses to pain and opioid craving. The PI?s NIDA K23, entitled Co-morbid Opioid Addiction and Chronic Pain, used a human laboratory paradigm to identify the unique treatment needs of opioid addicted adults with chronic pain, including a need for an integrated treatment to improve both pain and craving tolerance (i.e. not just pain sensitivity), and to develop adaptive cognitive hyper-control and new automatic psycho-physiological craving trigger responses similar to the responses found among co-morbid pain and addiction patients who have maintained long-term opioid abstinence.6  The human laboratory findings6 derived in the first 3 years of the K23 were then used develop ?STOP,? the first iteration of an integrated group therapy treatment protocol designed to synergistically treat co-morbid opioid addiction and chronic pain over 12 weekly sessions to be used within the context of Medication Assisted Treatment in community addiction treatment centers. The model is thus designed to ease dissemination within existing community medication treatment models, Preliminary pre-post data from the K23 cohort of 14 subjects treated with STOP suggest high levels of acceptability of the protocol, improved pain tolerance, decreased cravings, and less drug use. In addition, subjects provided feedback to improve the protocol. The current R34 application is the next logical step to:1)modify the treatment manual and participant workbook based on the data derived from the initial K23 testing; 2)develop a clinician training protocol to train addiction counselors and treatment integrity measures which expands the K23 study in which the PI (Wachholtz) was the primary study therapist; 3)test the modified manual in a cohort of 10 subjects and modify once more if necessary, and 4)test the modified protocol in a Stage 1b Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) with 50 subjects using primary outcomes of reduced opioid cravings and use, improved pain tolerance, and increased functional activity via mechanisms of improved pain and craving responses. Four specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1 (Stage 1a). Finalize the STOP therapist manual and participant workbook by merging quantitative and qualitative subject response data from the K23 pilot study to modify the initial K23 manual, and then test it on a 10 subject cohort. The protocol will then be refined again in response to subject feedback and quantitative data to yield a final 12-session, community friendly, stand alone, rolling entry psychotherapy manual that can be used within established substance abuse treatment delivery systems, and will simultaneously and integratively address therapeutic challenges of both chronic pain and addiction. Specific Aim 2. Develop and field test a clinician training protocol for addiction counselors who have no prior expertise in pain management, as well as treatment integrity measures for the treatment manual. Specific Aim 3 (Stage 1b). Complete small scale (N=50) Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) comparing the new STOP protocol (n=25) to the current standard of care (?Treatment as Usual,? TAU; n=25) for opiate addiction in a sample of subjects with co-morbid opioid use disorder and chronic pain to establish initial effect sizes in preparation for a larger trial.13 TAU will include psychotherapy as provided by addiction providers; the STOP protocol will include STOP. There will be 3 assessment time points: pre-intervention, immediately post- intervention, and 1 month follow-up to assess for short term and longer term effects of the protocol. Specific Aim 4. To preliminarily test a mediation path from increased use of adaptive cognitive and behavioral responses, to pain and addiction cravings, to increased pain tolerance, decreased cravings and increased engagement in daily activities, to reduced drug use for use in preparation for future research studies."
"9586242","For many species of virus, the first virion to infect a cell will exclude any subsequent virion entry, preventing that cell from becoming ?superinfected?. This process, called superinfection exclusion (SIE) is important be- cause many aspects of viral pathology and transmission are affected by the number of virions that infect a single cell. In this proposal, we aim to discover the mechanism of an early form of Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) SIE and the transcriptional responses that govern exclusion in the nervous system. Currently, there is a critical knowledge gap regarding the mechanism and effectors of early exclusion preventing experimental manipulation of SIE. The ability to specifically target and manipulate SIE is necessary to study how SIE affects neuronal pathogenesis and spread in vitro and in vivo. The experiments in this proposal aim to bridge this gap by identifying how early HSV-1 SIE blocks infection, and the specific cellular and viral genes that contribute to early SIE. Our first aim will employ quantitative assays to identify the effect of SIE on secondary HSV-1 virion fusion and entry. Knowing the stage of entry that is blocked by SIE is a critical step in determining the overall mechanism. The goal of our second aim is to modulate the expression of individual viral and cellular genes to alter SIE phenotypes in vitro. Based on published literature and our own preliminary data, we have compiled a list of candidate genes known to be differentially expressed during HSV-1 infections. Using an ICP4-null strain of HSV-1 that does not support SIE, we have refined our list of genes to those that are differentially expressed between HSV-1 infection conditions that either do or do not induce SIE. Restoring the expression of individual genes under ICP4-null conditions to see if an SIE phenotype can be restored, and vice versa, will allow us to identify critical SIE effectors. This proposal will identify the mechanism of early HSV-1 SIE and produce the tools necessary to alter levels of exclusion through the manipulation of gene expression. Once these tools and targets have been obtained, we can quickly move into applicable in vitro and in vivo studies that will evaluate the effect of early HSV-1 SIE on neuronal transmission and viral pathogenesis. Understanding how HSV-1 induces early SIE will help us to understand the transmission of herpesviruses within the nervous system and potentially be exploited by new antiviral therapies directed at treating and preventing HSV-1 disease."
"9468380","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A common misconception is that U.S. military personnel are fit, lean, and healthy because of the military lifestyle (and its emphasis on health promotion), inferring that the military has somehow escaped the civilian obesity epidemic. To the contrary, 34% of women actively serving in the U.S. military are overweight and 6% are obese. Many women (and particularly overweight and obese women) gain weight excessively while pregnant, and excessive gestational weight gain is a significant risk factor for perinatal complications and postpartum weight retention. Postpartum weight retention, in particular, is a significant concern for women serving in the United States military, as they only 6 months postpartum to return to fitness standards and they can be discharged if they fail their fitness test. Postpartum weight retention is also a significant concern for military readiness (or the ability to quickly mobilize for national defense), which is the single most important metric for th Department of Defense. Given the negative health implications of excessive gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention, the impediment of excess weight on military readiness and military careers, and the dearth of research on gestational weight gain and postpartum weight loss in the United States military, we propose a stepped-care gestational weight gain intervention and a stepped-care postpartum weight loss intervention for active duty women, based on the Look AHEAD Intensive Lifestyle Intervention, that accommodates the lifestyle and environment that is unique to military personnel. We will randomize 450 participants to 1 of 3 arms: a) a gestational weight gain intervention); b) a postpartum weight loss intervention, or c) a combined gestational weight gain and postpartum weight loss intervention and determine the efficacy of the interventions on gestational weight gain as well as 6-month postpartum weight loss. In addition, we will examine medical outcomes and health care utilization (from the electronic medical record) and fitness test data (from the military fitness database) by intervention arm. We will also gather process data related to treatment outcome (e.g., session participation, self-monitoring adherence, meal replacement adherence, physical activity). We will determine whether a gestational weight gain intervention, a postpartum weight loss intervention, or a combination of the two interventions is most efficacious in improving postpartum weight loss, maternal health, and military readiness. These outcomes are expected to have an important positive impact because the intervention(s) could be disseminated the entire United States Military and integrated into standard health care for pregnant/postpartum military women."
"9467724","Project Summary/ Abstract Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect affecting approximately 1% of all live births in the US and is one of the leading causes of infant mortality. A severe form of CHD can result from Heterotaxy (Htx), a disorder of the left-right (LR) patterning during embryonic development. A recent genetic analysis of heterotaxy patients identified a novel CHD candidate gene, mink1. Mink1 encodes a serine-threonine germinal-center kinase with known functions in the JNK and PCP/Wnt signaling pathways. However, it has no known role in LR patterning or cardiac development. Using CRISPR knockout strategies in the high-throughput human disease model, Xenopus, loss of mink1 leads to cardiac and LR patterning defects, and defects in motile cilia formation and resulting fluid flow. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate the molecular mechanism by which mink1 affects LR patterning, heart development, and cilia formation in the Xenopus (frog) model system. The first aim will use loss of function experiments to determine the required role for mink1 during the LR patterning cascade b testing molecular markers. Mechanistic hypotheses will be guided by an analysis of temporal and spatial expression of mink1 in the whole embryo and the left-right organizer. The second aim will use loss of function experiments to determine the requirement for mink1 during formation of motile cilia on the multi-ciliated cells of the Xenopus epidermis, which recapitulates a common mucociliary defect found in CHD patients. Hypotheses will be directed by a review of relevant literature including a role in regulation of multi-ciliated cell fate specification through Notch signaling or a requirement for Mink1 during basal body docking and/or establishment of polarity. The third aim will determine the role of each mink1 domain in the context of cilia formation on multi-ciliated cells and LR patterning/cardiac development. Then it will be determined if the patient mutation in the kinase-encoding domain is determination to function using multiple functional assays in Xenopus. Altogether, these experiments will improve our understanding of cardiac development and the role of mink1 in the pathogenesis of CHD. In the future, this will benefit genetic testing and counseling, as well as improve outcomes in CHD because treatments can be tailored to genotype rather than solely on CHD phenotype. In addition, this application details the applicant's training plan including research mentorship, advanced coursework, training in new techniques, and the development of skills in scientific professionalism, writing, and presentation of data. The research and training outlined in this application will prepare the applicant to pursue a career performing patient-driven research as an independent research scientist."

"9520594","SUMMARY Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) and Adenosine Monophosphate Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) are part of a signaling node in a network of opposing metabolic pathways. In conditions of nutritional sufficiency, mTORC1 is active and stimulates pathways that generate proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids necessary for cell growth and proliferation. In conditions of nutritional insufficiency, AMPK is activated to restore the energy charge of the cell by promoting catabolic processes and inhibiting anabolic processes. Viruses rely on cellular mechanisms for the generation of substrates needed for their replication and have evolved numerous interactions with cellular factors that regulate production of these substrates. We will focus on how hepatitis B virus (HBV) affects metabolic homeostasis in hepatocytes. This HBV effect likely establishes an environment suitable for its own replication while altering the metabolic set-point and rendering hepatocytes more or less sensitive to stressors. Chronic HBV infection is a cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, HBV-associated HCC develops after decades of infection, suggesting that HBV is weakly oncogenic and may only be a co-factor in HCC development. The HBV HBx protein is necessary for HBV replication and has a role in HBV-associated oncogenesis. We have shown that HBx activates mTORC1 and AMPK, that HBV replication is suppressed by mTORC1 and promoted by AMPK, and that expression of HBV proteins is elevated in the context of signals that inhibit global mRNA translation. A protein that was named HBx-interacting protein (HBXIP) was identified in a screen for cellular HBx-interacting proteins. HBXIP (renamed Late Endosomal/ Lysosomal Adaptor, MAPK and mTOR Activator 5 (Lamtor-5)) was recently identified as a component of the Ragulator complex, which regulates mTORC1 activity; this positions HBx at a metabolic signaling node. Our goals are to determine if HBV infection alters metabolic homeostasis established by opposing mTORC1 and AMPK pathways, whether this sensitizes or de-sensitizes cells to stresses that signal through these pathways, and whether a consequence of this is alteration of cellular protein synthesis. The results of these studies will lay the foundation for more comprehensive analyses of how HBV affects hepatocyte metabolism and how this influences expression of cellular and HBV proteins. We hypothesize that HBV interferes with cellular homeostasis to favor its own replication and that this alters the response of hepatocytes to other stresses. Over time, this leads to disruptions in hepatocyte survival and proliferation and contributes to HCC development. We will: 1. Examine whether HBx re-sets the homeostatic metabolic balance in hepatocytes, resulting in altered sensitivity of the cells to signaling through either mTORC1 or AMPK; and 2. Determine the effects of HBV- induced mTORC1 and AMPK activation on the efficiency of translation of viral and cellular mRNAs."
"9510124","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Rickettsioses represent devastating human infections. Epidemic typhus and Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) are two of the most lethal infections known to humans. Although rickettsial infections can be controlled by appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy if diagnosed early, up to 20% of misdiagnosed or untreated and 5% of treated RMSF cases can be fatal. In addition, high infectivity and severe illness after inhalation make rickettsiae potential bioterrorism threats. Disseminated endothelial infection and endothelial barrier disruption with increased microvascular permeability are the central pathophysiologic features. However, a vaccine is not available for fatal rickettsioses, and novel host mechanism-based prophylactics and therapeutics are urgently needed. We have reported that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling plays a critical role during fatal rickettsioses through the cAMP-exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) signaling axis. However, the role of upstream signaling pathway in this pathology is completely unknown. Adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) is predominantly expressed in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). A2AR has been well recognized to serve as an upstream regulator of cAMP signaling and to be able to stimulate the intracellular cAMP accumulation. We found that the approved Parkinson?s disease (PD) drug KW6002, an A2AR antagonist, dramatically suppressed rickettsial infection in both a cell model and a vasculature model. Inactivation of A2AR by KW6002 weakens the nano-binding force of the rickettsial adhesin rOmpB to living endothelial cells (ECs), thereby limiting rickettsial adherence to ECs. These findings suggest that the A2AR- cAMP signaling pathway may control rickettsial infection by acting on host rickettsial-binding receptor(s) in ECs. We propose our central hypothesis that the selective A2AR antagonist KW6002 can provide protective efficacy against rickettsial infection by impeding bacterial adhesion to ECs. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To identify endothelial surface targets regulated by A2AR during rickettsial adhesion. Aim 2: To define the nanomechanical mechanism of rickettsial adhesion to endothelial surfaces regulated by A2AR. Aim 3: To evaluate whether KW6002 can protect against lethal rickettsial infection by arresting rickettsial adherence to the endothelial lining in vivo. We will test our hypothesis by employing cutting-edge approaches, i.e., 1) functional imaging of the interactions between rickettsial adhesins and living EC surfaces using AFM, and 2) a novel, anatomy-based, in vivo quantitative bacterial adhesion measuring system. Outcomes will provide deeper insights into the biomechanical and molecular mechanisms of rickettsial infections, but more importantly it is expected that the data will support the scientific justification for repurposing an approved drug for immediate use in clinical trials to battle the dreadful human diseases caused by Rickettsia."
"9469447","Project Summary/Abstract (Mark Nesbit)  The superfamily of radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes (RSEs) are responsible for catalyzing a wide variety of unusual and difficult chemical reactions which are critical for the survival of living organisms from bacteria to humans. RSEs are identified by binding of a redox active [4Fe-4S] cluster through three cysteine residues (typically from a CX3CX2C sequence). The initial step in RSE catalyzed reactions where SAM binds to the [4Fe-4S] cluster and is reduced to generate Ado? (5?-deoxyadenosyl radical) appears to be common to all RSEs. However, despite having many structural similarities and sharing a common initiation step RSEs are able to catalyze a wide variety of chemical transformations and are involved in peptide modification, metalloprotein cluster assembly and cofactor biosynthesis. Two RSEs involved in peptide modification are PqqE and MftC. PqqE catalyzes a C-C bond forming step in the biosynthesis of the redox cofactor PQQ. MftC catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of the C-terminus tyrosine residue in the MftA peptide as a part of the biosynthesis of the proposed redox cofactor mycofactocin. Studying the mechanisms by which these genetically related enzymes are able to catalyze vastly different chemical reactions will provide valuable insight into the varied functionality of RSEs in nature.  The planned investigation will interrogate the mechanism of the C-C bond forming step in PQQ biosynthesis catalyzed by the radical SAM enzyme PqqE and the oxidative decarboxylation of a C-terminus tyrosine residue catalyzed by MftC. Continuous wave EPR, and pulsed methods such as ENDOR will be able to intimately probe the nature of potential radical organic and organometallic intermediates. The use of non-natural amino acids designed to stabilize potential radical intermediates and incorporated into analogs of the peptide substrates will assist in these experiments. Additional spectroscopic methods such as rapid freeze-quench 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy will provide data which complements the EPR studies allowing for observation of all Fe nuclei in a sample under turnover conditions. The data produced by these experiments will help to further the mechanistic understanding of the diverse array of biological reactions catalyzed by radical SAM enzymes and provide additional characterization of physical and electronic structures of the PqqE and MftC under catalytically relevant conditions. Additionally, these methods may be used to study other RSEs and will provide a strong spectroscopic foundation of knowledge about the mechanisms by which this diverse family of enzymes accomplishes the unique biological roles they have adapted to fill."

"9511007","ABSTRACT Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses are highly pathogenic type species of the Henipavirus (HNV) genus within the family Paramyxoviridae. Zoonotic transmission of NiV and HeV from their natural fruit bat reservoirs to humans can result in mortality rates in excess of 90%. In humans, HNVs can cause acute and fatal respiratory disease and encephalitis. Although the exact route of transmission in humans is not known, epidemiological studies and studies in experimental animal models suggest that the respiratory tract is important for virus replication. Importantly, human-to-human transmission was previously reported during outbreaks and NiV could be isolated from respiratory secretions. Currently, our knowledge is still limited on the target cells in the respiratory tract, the immune responses during infection, as well as the molecular mechanisms by which HNVs can cause disease. Our overall goal is to establish and evaluate a human 3D lung microphysiologic organ culture (MHOC) model to study NiV infections of the human lung. Specifically the ability of testing the influence of the respiratory microbiome (RMB) on the course of infections in this model is of great importance, since it has been reported that NiV patients with symptomatic respiratory tract infections were significantly more likely to transmit NiV. Our primary objective is to utilize a human lung 3D MHOC model to develop an in vitro model, which will allow studying the mechanisms of lung-associated pathobiology after infection with NiV. A secondary objective is to study the impact of the lung microbiome on infection. Our hypothesis is that this in vitro reconstituted 3D human lung model will demonstrate its relevance as a novel model to study molecular mechanisms of HNV lung pathology and potentially allow for the evaluation of antiviral therapeutics. To interrogate our driving hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Investigate progressive NiV infection in the human 3D lung MHOC model. Specific Aim 2: Examine the implications of the human lung microbiome on the course of NiV infection."
"9600337","Project Summary/Abstract Malaria has a devastating global impact on public health and welfare, with the majority of the world?s malaria cases occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria causes more than 400 thousand deaths every year, and about 3.4 billion people are at risk of contracting the disease. Anopheles mosquitoes are exclusive vectors of malaria, with species from the An. gambiae complex being the most important African vectors. Increasing insecticide resistance in anopheline mosquitoes now threatens the sustainability of current control efforts. A possible reason for the quick evolution and spread of insecticide resistance may be in the peculiar genetic architecture of malaria vectors. High levels of genetic diversity of Anopheles could mean that resistance mutations may already be present and that mosquito populations can quickly adapt to new insecticides. Therefore, population genomics studies uncover both challenges and opportunities for mosquito control in Africa. However, these analyses are limited by the availability of the single chromosome-level reference genome assembly for the An. gambiae PEST strain. In contrast, genomes of other major malaria vectors, An. arabiensis and An. coluzzii, are represented by numerous unmapped sequencing scaffolds; they have unidentified gaps and missing sequences, which may cause incorrect or incomplete annotation of genomic sequences; and they lack clear distinction between paralogous genes and genes from different haplotypes. As a result, these assemblies cannot be used as reliable references for population genomics studies and other chromosome-level analyses. Our long-term goal is to understand how natural genetic and chromosomal variations are connected with ecology and epidemiology of major malaria vectors. The central goal of this R21 is to develop, validate, and test high-quality genome assemblies for An. arabiensis and An. coluzzii. Toward this end, we propose three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Develop genome assemblies for An. arabiensis and An. coluzzii using PacBio sequencing and chromosome-scale Hi-C scaffolding. Specific Aim 2. Validate the PacBio assemblies and construct physical genome maps for An. arabiensis and An. coluzzii. Specific Aim 3. Assess performance of the An. arabiensis and An. coluzzii genome assemblies as references for population genomics studies. Our expectation is that the integration of novel sequencing and scaffolding techniques with physical mapping will result in a more complete, chromosome-based assemblies that will facilitate studies of genetic diversity in An. arabiensis and An. coluzzii. Our hope is that by using species-specific genome assemblies, we may uncover important genomic variation that was missed when the An. gambiae assembly was used. This methodological advantage will remove an important limitation to uncover genetic determinants of their differing epidemiological contributions to disease transmission."
"9479108","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid hormone is a critical mediator of fetal development and then essential for normal metabolic and neurologic function during adulthood. It exerts its actions through a complex process where serum concentrations are perceived in a cell-specific fashion depending upon their active transport, activation or inactivation by deiodination and finally by genomic activation via thyroid hormone receptor isoforms (TR). Gene regulation by the TRs, besides TH, requires both nuclear corepressors and coactivators which determine the degree of activation or repression of target genes in the presence of a set amount of TH. Importantly, as we have shown in the last grant period and in new preliminary data, the nuclear corepressors play an essential role in determining cell-specific T3 action. In particular NCoR1 is essential in determining the set point of the thyroid axis and TH sensitivity in the liver Based on these observations the overriding hypothesis of this proposal is that nuclear corepressors, NCoR1 and SMRT, play cell-specific and TR isoform specific roles in TH action. By uncovering these roles we will gain new insight into how to activate key pathways that will enhance metabolic function in humans. To accomplish this we propose three Aims. In the first Aim we will assess the role of SMRT systemically in TH action by using novel mouse genetic models and also determine its role in the syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone. In the second Aim we will determine how NCoR1 mediates TH sensitivity and test the role of coregulator content in TH sensitivity in humans. Finally in Aim 3 we will determine how TH-signaling in conjunction with NCoR1/SMRT controls a key lipid storage pathway that prevents adverse metabolic complications. Together completion of these Aims will provide key insight and how modulation of corepressor function can beneficially enhance TH action to improve health in humans."

"9479604","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is unique among chronic conditions in that there is no accepted role for combining medications, even in patients who are at the highest risk of fracture. Both anabolic and antiresorptive osteoporosis therapies increase bone density and reduce fracture incidence but are unable to restore skeletal integrity in most patients with established disease. Attempts to combine the only available anabolic agent (teriparatide) with the most commonly used antiresorptive agents (bisphosphonates) have demonstrated no benefit compared to each drug alone. Conversely, we recently reported that the combination of teriparatide and the nuclear factor-?B ligand inhibitor, denosumab, increases bone density and improves cortical microarchitecture more than each drug alone. This combination shows superior efficacy, at least in part, because denosumab is able to fully block teriparatide's pro-resorptive effects while allowing for continued bone formation. Thus, combining denosumab with a more potent anabolic stimulus may allow for greater separation of formation and resorption and larger improvements in bone mass and strength. To test this hypothesis, we have initiated a 15-month clinical trial to evaluate the therapeutic potential of combining high-dose teriparatide (40-µg daily) with denosumab in postmenopausal osteoporotic women. Because the discontinuation of both teriparatide and denosumab are associated with rapid bone loss, if any combination of these medications is to become a widely used treatment approach, strategies to consolidate and expand skeletal improvements must be defined. The aim of the current proposal is to evaluate a rational and cost-effective approach to this consolidation by testing the hypotheses that in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the large increases in bone density and improvements in bone quality achieved with combined denosumab/teriparatide therapy will be maintained and extended by a single administration of an intravenous bisphosphonate. Specifically, women who complete the high-dose teriparatide study will be offered enrollment in a single arm 27-month open-label extension. In this extension, women will receive a single 5-mg intravenous dose of zoledronic acid. Bone mineral density will then be assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and quantitative CT, skeletal microarchitecture will be assessed by high-resolution peripheral QCT, bone strength will be determined by finite element analysis, and the tissue material properties of cortical bone will be measured by reference point indentation periodically over the 27 months (42 months total treatment duration). If our hypotheses are confirmed, this study will successfully introduce a new framework for the treatment of osteoporosis; one that utilizes short-term combined anabolic/antiresorptive therapy followed by a single infusion of bisphosphonate to dramatically increase BMD and improve skeletal integrity over a sustained period.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB) and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine (OB/GYN), collaborating with the Department of Pediatrics of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Neonatology), propose to continue and enhance an innovative, rigorous, and highly successful two- to three-year research training program for clinicians in reproductive epidemiology. This training program attracts trainees from across the US and its graduates are placed in academic institutions nationwide, resulting in a program of high impact.  The training program consists of required courses in epidemiology, clinical research methodology, biostatistics, and reproductive epidemiology; elective courses relevant to the trainees' methodologic interests; journal clubs and clinical research conferences conducted by participating faculty in the CCEB, OB/GYN, and the Neonatology; extensive independent readings; instruction in the responsible conduct of research; a professional development series; grant writing and grant development experiences; and the completion of an independent research project in reproductive epidemiology. The program: 1) trains clinicians to be rigorous and independent academic investigators able to use the range of approaches available in epidemiology to address research issues in reproductive medicine, women's health, and/or neonatology related to the etiology, prognosis, prevention and early detection, treatment, clinical economics, technology assessment, medical decision making, and quality of patient care; 2) provides closely mentored research experiences with faculty preceptors in clinical epidemiology, and obstetrics and gynecology; and 3) strengthen the links between traditional epidemiology, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, and women's health. Trainees matriculate in the Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology (MSCE) program.  Strengths of the proposed program are: 1) the long history of successful research training programs in the CCEB, and OB/GYN; 2) the collaborative links that have been forged among the faculty of these academic entities; 3) the comprehensive course offerings and research programs that are available to trainees; and 4) an extensive set of experienced program directors and faculty preceptors with successful training records. In addition, the availability of the broad range of rich expertise of the faculties in the CCEB, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and the Division of Neonatology; numerous existing large databases that can be used for research projects and training; a broad array of specialized analytic capabilities available for clinical studies (e.g., clinical trials, cse-control, cohort research, etc.); and the faculties' commitment to collaborative research and training, combine to provide an ideal environment for this training program. Finally, Penn and the PSOM promote an academic environment in which basic and clinical research are encouraged and viewed as attractive career paths for physicians."
"9610549","PROJECT SUMMARY Viral infections have profound effects on human health. Acute viral infections cause damage to host tissues through cytopathic effects or via the inflammatory or immune responses they induce. Acute viral infections also predispose to secondary bacterial infections ? particularly pneumonias. Persistent or chronic viral infections that are associated with prolonged viral replication, such as Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), also cause altered and impaired immune responses against bacteria, cancer, vaccines, and other inflammatory stimuli. Type I IFNs are produced abundantly during viral infections and in response to viral products such as double-stranded RNA. These cytokines ligate a common ubiquitously- expressed receptor (IFNAR) to dramatically alter cellular physiology and elicit diverse effects on host inflammatory and immune responses. The ability of type I IFNs to induce expression of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) with antiviral effector functions has thus long been known to promote cell-intrinsic host resistance during acute viral infections. However, these cytokines also have regulatory effects that are associated with increased susceptibility to many acute bacterial infections, as well as chronic viral infections and post-viral bacterial infections. The studies outlined in this proposal investigate the relative importance of myeloid cell IFNGR down regulation as a target of immune suppression by type I IFNs. The impact of this process will be analyzed using the recently generated fGR1 transgenic mouse model. The impact of fGR1 expression on macrophage IL-10 production and viral persistence will be investigated, as will its impact on neutrophil responses and secondary bacterial infections of the lung and bloodstream."
"9476369","Project Summary Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuron degeneration and the aggregation of misfolded proteins. Except for symptomatic relief, no therapy is currently available to prevent or reverse the disease process. One of the major obstacles for developing an effective treatment is the lack of methods to diagnose PD prior to the clinical symptoms, which usually occur after the loss of a large amount of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The overall goal of our project is to develop a sensitive and definitive method for early diagnosis of PD. We are targeting the alpha-synuclein (?- syn) aggregates because they appeared early during the disease process and are intimately associated with the disease progression. Taking advantage of the seeding capability of ?-syn aggregates, we propose to use the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) method to measure the capabilities of ?-syn aggregates to seed recombinant monomeric ?-syn to assemble into amyloid fibrils, which is able to significantly amplify the signal and allow us to detect a minuscule amount of ?-syn aggregates. In this application, we designed novel strategies in order to significantly improve the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, which allow us to overcome the major obstacles blocking the application of ?-syn PMCA in clinical settings. Although these are mainly technical improvements, if successful, they will transform ?-syn PMCA from a bench side experimental assay into a useful clinical test, which has the great potential to develop into an early diagnostic tool for PD or other synucleinopathies. Moreover, the target measured in our assay, ?-SN aggregates with seeding capability, also has the potential to develop into a useful biomarker for monitoring disease progression, estimating therapeutic efficacy, and/or stratifying this complicated neurodegenerative disease."
"9503944","Project Summary NIMH Strategic Objective 4 states that the ?chronic disability ... of Serious Mental Illnesses (SMI)...demands a rapid response.? Approximately 4.1% of the adult US population meets the criteria for SMI, a mental disorder associated with significant functional impairment. Even when effective, pharmacologic and psychological treatments often leave individuals with SMI with residual symptoms, impairment, and at risk for re- hospitalization and suicide. The month following hospitalization is a particularly risky time; thus, augmentation treatments that can speed up improvement during brief hospital stays, as well as provide a bridge to outpatient care are urgently needed. Thus, we propose to develop an augmentation to psychiatric hospital care (called ?I- Change?) that can be continued at home following discharge. I-Change targets interpretation bias, the tendency to resolve ambiguous situations negatively. Interpretation bias is a well-established cognitive vulnerability for psychopathology and is associated with poor emotion regulation, rumination, symptom severity, and suicidal ideation. For example, in our psychiatric hospital sample, interpretation bias upon admission accounted for 28% of the variance in treatment response, and predicted suicidal ideation at discharge, controlling for ideation at admission. Although some existing treatments target this mechanism, most notably Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), they require individuals to be able to recognize their automatic interpretations and use complex techniques to reappraise them. Individuals with SMI who are experiencing symptoms acute enough to require hospitalization are often treatment refractory and may experience particular difficulty applying these techniques. It is therefore critical to more efficiently and effectively engage this target. Over the past 14 years, the PI has developed and validated a training task that utilizes repetition and feedback to reinforce a healthier interpretive style. The computer-delivered version of the task was acceptable to an SMI population and led to better treatment response than a placebo task in patients who exhibited interpretation bias at baseline. We seek to develop this task into a personalized smart-phone delivered intervention. We will harness smart-phone technology to enhance skill acquisition and generalization by improving user engagement and prompting patients to complete a session at set times to ensure adequate dosage and spacing of sessions. We will conduct an open trial (n = 16) and RCT (n = 64) to confirm target engagement (improvement in interpretation bias), evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of delivering I- Change during and following discharge from a partial hospital, and examine clinical outcomes (global improvement, functioning) related to changes in interpretation. We expect that I-Change will shift interpretation bias, be acceptable to patients with SMI, and lead to greater global improvement compared to a Symptom Tracking control. Results will support a fully-powered R01 effectiveness trial."

In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic Cl will be randomly assigned to 16 weeks of: 1) office-based vergence/ accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy. After 16 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome measures of reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-III]) reading comprehension subtest score and attention (Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]) will be assessed by examiners masked to treatment group. The Gates MacGlnitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Reading fluency, another test of attention, the Cl Symptom Survey, and clinical measures of Cl (i.e., the near point of convergence, and positive fusional vergence al near) are other secondary outcome measures; also included are assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading comprehension including pseudo word decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension. Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention are assessed 1-year post treatment.  This application documents our site's ability to recruit at least 36 subjects and o retain them for 1 year after completion of treatment. Documentation is provided that our site has the appropriate personnel, equipment, and facilities to conduct the study in accordance with the CITT-ART Manual of Procedures (MOP).  Complete details of the study rationale, design, and methods are contained in the Manual of Procedures (submitted with the Study Chair and Data Coordinating Center [DCC] applications). In addition to our center, there are 8 other optometric or ophthalmologic centers, the Study Chair at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, and the DCC at The Ohio State University Optometry Coordinating Center.  Symptomatic Cl is a common vision disorder in children that is commonly associated with symptoms while reading (e.g. loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading slowly, and trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of Cl treatment on reading and attention is unknown. The results of the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and have important implications for educators, psychologists, and physicians who care for children with reading and attention problems. The findings will guide hypothesis development for future scientific investigations in children with vision disorders."
"9551658","CORE A: RECRUITMENT AND PHENOTYPING CORE ABSTRACT: Although congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a common birth defect, it is still relatively rare and requires infrastructure for recruiting, clinically characterizing, and obtaining biospecimens on patients, and is the foundation for the success of this Program Project. By merging two well-established CDH research programs (Massachusetts General Hospital/Boston Children?s Hospital and Columbia/DHREAMS) we have established one of the largest and most carefully characterized CDH cohorts in the world. Collectively, these two studies have enrolled 1500 patients with CDH and 2683 unaffected family members, and ongoing recruitment is expected to enroll 900 additional patients over the course of this 5 year grant. This Core supports the recruitment and consent of participants, collection of extensive phenotypic data including retrospective medical record review and longitudinal clinical follow-up, collection and processing of biospecimens, and management of data and IRB protocols. The specimens collected will be used extensively for all genomic studies proposed in Project I. Furthermore, the detailed phenotyping of human subjects will be instrumental in the interpretation of data derived from mouse models in Projects II and III, and patient-specific cell lines will be used for functional assays in Project III."
"9151134","ABSTRACT  Monkey B virus (BV) is a herpesvirus common in macaque (rhesus, cynomolgus) monkeys which are an invaluable resource for biomedical research. When BV is transmitted to humans, ~80% of patients die and survivors frequently experience progressive neurological decline, making BV the single greatest zoonotic danger facing research and veterinary personnel who work with macaques. Drugs currently used to treat BV infections were developed for treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, and are all are less effective against BV than HSV. Even when treated with ganciclovir (GCV), the most effective drug, some BV patients still die. Studies in mice also suggest that the current recommended treatment protocol may be flawed, allowing undetected BV infections to invade the central nervous system, resulting in a drastically diminished chance of patient survival. Since new drugs specifically targeted at BV are unlikely to be developed due to a lack of financial incentive, therapy using existing antivirals needs to be optimized. In the proposed study drugs shown to be effective against HSV and some experimental drugs will be tested for in vivo efficacy against BV by systemic administration using a mouse model. Preliminary experiments indicate that drugs applied topically can provide protection against BV that is as effective as systemically administered drugs. In addition, cidofovir (CDV) appears to be more effective against BV than GCV (the most effective drug currently recommended for treatment of BV infections) and an experimental drug having a different mode of action than GCV or CDV is also effective against BV, raising the possibility of its use in a dual drug regimen for added treatment efficacy. These results need to be followed up with additional research to validate use of topical drug delivery as a means of preventing neurological BV infections, use of CDV to treat BV infections, and the potential efficacy of dual drug regimens. This project will produce the needed confirmatory data and test the efficacy of dual drug regimens. The results will serve as a rational scientific basis for possible modification of existing recommendations for treatment of zoonotic BV infections."
"9594242","PROJECT ABSTRACT Targeting novel cellular processes is critical to maintaining a fresh antibiotic development pipeline. In that regard, we hypothesize that the essential Staphylococcus aureus protein, RnpA, is a unique and druggable antimicrobial target. We also predict that successful RnpA inhibitor development campaigns will provide new classes of broad spectrum antibiotics that can be used for the therapeutic intervention of S. aureus, other Gram-positive organisms and Gram-negative pathogens of immediate and emerging healthcare concern. Accordingly, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of microbiologists, biochemists, chemists, computational and structural biologists to launch a two-pronged approach to determine whether physiologically promising RnpA inhibitors can be reasonably achieved. Specifically, we will use a whole cell RnpA inhibitor enrichment assay combined with a validated enzyme target based approach (Aim 1) and fragment-based screening approach (Aim 2) to arrive at RnpA inhibitors. A benefit of this program is that it allows integration of structural and computational data for rational hit optimization regardless of their identification route and will be guided by our recently solved S. aureus RnpA X-ray crystal structure. While the approaches used are cutting-edge, the true innovation of this project may reside in the target itself. RnpA forms two holoenzymes, both of which mediate distinct and putatively independently essential cellular functions, RNA degradation and ptRNA maturation. Consequently, targeting RnpA potentially allows three routes of identifying therapeutically promising chemical classes of inhibitors and project success, including those that inhibit the protein's modulation of: 1. mRNA decay, 2. ptRNA processing or 3. Both processes."
"9527540","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This an application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award for Dr. Valy Fontil, an Assistant Adjunct Professor in General Internal Medicine at the University of California San Francisco who is establishing himself as a young investigator in implementation research of health systems-based strategies to improve hypertension control in underserved, high-risk populations. This K23 award will provide him with the necessary support evaluation of a hypertension management invention in 12 safety-net clinics and test a novel technology-enabled intervention that engages patients and enables shared decision-making between patients and providers to optimize visit frequency, treatment intensification, and medication adherence for treatment of hypertension. To achieve these goals, Dr. Fontil has assembled a multi-disciplinary mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Doming, a renowned expert in cardiovascular epidemiology, health disparities research, and simulation modeling, and two co-mentors: Dr. Mark Pletcher, renowned cardiovascular epidemiologist with added expertise in clinical decision-making, decision analysis, and use of emerging technology for improving health; and Dr. Charles McCulloch, Head of the Division of Biostatistics at UCSF and expert in advanced statistical analysis of longitudinal data. Safety-net healthcare institutions, which care for our highest-risk populations, must play a pivotal role in achieving national priorities for improved BP control and reducing HTN disparities. Therefore, it is essential to develop and test practical solutions that these healthcare systems can employ within their resource constraints. Dr. Fontil will build on findings from his previous work in simulation modeling and real-world pilot intervention to focus on optimizing two key processes of care (visit frequency, treatment intensification, and medication adherence) that can improve BP control to upward of 80%. First, he will evaluate race-specific effects of a health system intervention in safety net clinics (Aims 1&2) on improving these processes. Then he will adapt and test a technology-enabled intervention for feasibility of improving these processes in patients at safety-net clinics (Aim 3). The proposed research will provide the foundation and additional information needed to design a randomized controlled trial of a technology-enabled intervention to improve overall BP control and reduce racial disparities in BP control across a consortium of safety-net healthcare systems. This will form the basis of my future R01 proposal. Through a focused program of mentored training and coursework, the candidate will gain advanced skills and expertise in (1) training in using and analyzing electronic health record data for health services research, (2) advanced techniques in computer microsimulation modeling, and (3) foundational concepts and skills at the intersection of data science, technology and healthcare."
"9602325","Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), the mouse homolog of human CMV, is a well- characterized model system for the study of CMV infection in a mammalian host. There is a growing interest in the anti-viral role of MHC class Ib-restricted T cells, referred to as non- classical T cells. During the previous funding period, using mice deficient in conventional CD8+ T cells or CD1d-restricted NKT cells, we showed that non-classical T cells contribute significantly to the immune response to MCMV infection. Our preliminary data also demonstrate that a subset of non-classical CD8+ T cells, likely restricted by the Qa-1 molecule, is sufficient to protect against MCMV induced lethality. We therefore hypothesized that non-classical T cells may substitute for NK cells and conventional T cells when their effector responses are impaired during viral immuno-evasion. The objective of this proposal is to understand how non-classical T cells contribute to the immune response to viral infections. To accomplish these goals, we generated and acquired a variety of unique tools and animal models. These include KbDbQa-1 deficient animals, a new J?18-/- mouse line, an MCMV open reading frame library, and a large number of MCMV mutants. In Specific Aim 1, we will define MCMV specific Qa-1 restricted CD8+ T cells and identify the MCMV peptide(s) they recognize. In Specific Aim 2, we propose to investigate the role of CD1d, Qa-2 and M3 restricted T cells during MCMV infection. This proposal fills a major gap in our understanding of the role of non-classical T cells during viral infection. The results from these studies are likely to have relevance to infections caused by other viruses and aid in the design of strategies directed at manipulating non-classical T cells."
"9479685","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The intestinal lymphatic system serves physiological functions, including uptake of lipids, vitamins, immune surveillance, and fluid homeostasis. It is made up of distinct lymphatic endothelial cell populations that require regulatory pathways to maintain lymphatic vessel fate, microenvironment and functionality. We have demonstrated that Notch functions in cell fate determination of lymphatic endothelial cells and to maintain intestinal lymphatic homeostasis. Notch signaling is active throughout the intestinal lymphatic system, including the ductal, valve, and lacteal lymphatic endothelium. Disrupting Notch signaling or Mmp14 leads to shared lymphangiogenic and mesenteric lymphatic valve defects. Notch and MMP14 are linked to diverse intestinal and cardiovascular disorders and our novel studies will shed light on their role in intestinal diseases that have lymphatic defects as an underlying factor. We hypothesize that Notch regulates the extracellular matrix of the intestinal and mesenteric lymphatic vasculature via induction of MMPs and regulation of matrix proteins in a context-dependent manner. To address this hypothesis, we will determine lymphatic endothelial Notch function in postnatal intestinal and mesenteric lymphatics. We will use transgenic mice to transcriptional profile Notch responses in intestinal and mesenteric lymphatic endothelial cells and in a tether-ligand assay. The mechanism by which Notch regulates Mmp14 expression and its effects on lymphatic endothelial cell behavior will be determined. Conditional mice will be used to alter lymphatic endothelial Notch signaling with and without lymphatic endothelial Mmp14 deletion to define Notch functions in maturation and homeostasis of mesenteric lymphatic collecting ducts. As Notch is active in lacteal endothelial cells and Notch mutants display lacteal defects, we will use conditional mouse models to study the role of Notch in the lacteals during development and homeostasis. We will determine if abnormal matrix accumulation in the villi in Antxr1-/-;Antxr2-/- mice leads to lymphatic dysfunction and changes lymphatic endothelial Notch signaling. Our proposed research aims to uncover mechanisms by which Notch modulates extracellular matrix proteins and regulatory pathways in lymphatic endothelial cells to understand digest tract lymphatic development, homeostasis and function."
"9491936","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to investigate how signals in the amniotic fluid (AF) and nascent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) instruct neural stem cell behavior during early brain developmental stages surrounding the time of neural tube closure (E8.5-E10.5). The rapidly changing and growing population of neural stems at these early stages will give rise to all neurons and glia in the adult brain, yet comparatively few studies exist on the intrinsic genetc programs or the extrinsic fluid-based signals involved in driving these early stages of development, largely due to technical limitations. We and others have demonstrated broad influences of CSF and vascular fluid niches in instructing later stages of brain development. Yet virtually nothing is known about the protein composition of AF and early CSF during early brain development, at a time when the choroid plexus and vasculature have yet to form. Our overarching hypothesis is that secreted signals in the AF and nascent CSF are critical in instructing and synchronizing the proliferation and fate of embryonic E8.5-E10.5 neural stem cells bathed in these fluids. We will first test this hypothesis by comparing the effects of AF, early CSF and buffered media on stem cell explants at ages E8.5 and E10.5. We predict that, as in later development, early explants only develop normally when bathed in the age-appropriate fluid, suggesting that changes in the AF/CSF proteome are mirrored by changes in expression of associated receptors at the apical surface of neural stem cells. As such, we expect that normal stem cell function should be impaired by genetic perturbations to the cilia and membrane of neural stems cells at their apical surface, which is in direct contact with the AF/CSF. A near- complete list of CSF proteins and their associated receptors on apical membranes will then be deduced using quantitative mass-spec and RNAseq technologies, together with immunostaining. We will then determine the contributions of CSF-LIF and other top candidate proteins in instructing specific aspects of E10.5 stem cell behavior, and the embryonic sources of these CSF signals. This proposal has important clinical significance: We currently have relatively little understanding of the origins of early developmental disorders (defects due to errant neural tube closure, hydrocephalus, and infiltration by teratogens), and scant capacities for early diagnosis or intervention. This proposal should provide a foundation for asking how these early perturbations ultimately derail some or all aspects of normal brain development, and for developing minimally invasive AF/CSF sampling and replacement strategies for disease diagnosis and for reprogramming of neural stem cells in order to bring the development brain back on track."
"9478973","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The epidermis performs essential barrier functions that protect the body from environmental insults and maintain fluid-electrolyte balance. Defects in epidermal and follicular development lead to numerous diseases such as skin cancer, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, alopecia, and impaired wound healing. Whereas transcriptional programs have been well-studied in development and diseases of the skin, the role of alternative splicing (AS) in skin development and function is essentially unstudied. Nearly all mammalian multi- exon genes produce AS mRNAs and tissue-specific AS factors coordinate programs of AS to regulate biologically coherent pathways. Moreover, our preliminary data reveals that AS plays a critical, but unappreciated role in the regulatory programs of the development and function of both skin and hair. In this proposal, we will use our unique genetic mouse models to study the critical roles of splicing factors identified in our lab in epidermal physiology and hair growth. My laboratory made a landmark discovery that epithelial cell- type-specific splicing factors Esrp1 and Esrp2 regulate fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (Fgfr2) splicing, an AS event previously implicated in skin development and epidermal barrier function. To further investigate the role of Esrp-dependent AS in skin development, we generated mice with conditional and complete knockout alleles for Esrp1 and Esrp2. Combined Esrp1/Esrp2 KO is lethal and results in epidermal hypoplasia, defects in epidermal barrier function, and reduced numbers of hair follicles. We hypothesize that these phenotypes reflect the loss of key epithelial-specific splice isoforms and will use conditional gene knockout technology to further characterize the phenotypes of Esrp deletion and define a genome-wide program of Esrp-regulated AS in the skin through the following aims: 1) Determine the phenotypes associated with Esrp ablation in the interfollicular epidermis and in hair follicles. We will conditionally abate the Esrps using Esrp1flox/flox/Esrp2-/- mice in developing and adult epidermis and characterize the basic cellular processes that lead to epidermal and follicular defects. 2) Define comprehensive programs of Esrp regulated alternative splicing in the epidermis. We will use RNA-Seq and splicing sensitive microarrays to define genome-wide programs of AS in vitro and in vivo. Esrp regulated targets in the epidermis will be functionally screened in epithelial barrie assays. 3) Identify Esrp-regulated splicing programs in the hair follicle and differential splicingin the dermal papilla (DP). We will use inducible deletion strategies to determine the consequence of Esrp ablation on hair follicles and identify key Esrp targets in hair follicle bulge stem cells nd the hair germ (HG).  The proposed aims constitute the first comprehensive analysis of AS in skin development and function, thereby introducing a new paradigm to the field. These studies are needed to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which Esrp ablation in the skin induces epidermal barrier defects and hair loss in order to inform the development of future therapies to treat skin pathologies and alopecia."
"9478667","PROJECT SUMMARY Women and men are well known to have different propensities to neuropsychiatric illness, but the source of these differences is not understood. In particular, the molecular events that determine functional dimorphism between the female and male brain need to be defined. We will examine how the female-specific long noncoding RNA Xist and its newly identified interaction with the pre-mRNA splicing regulators PTBP1 and 2 affect gene expression and alternative splicing in the female brain. The project will use expertise and tools developed in three labs for the study of Xist RNA, of neuronal splicing regulation by the PTB proteins, and of gene expression and alternative splicing using computational methods. RNA-seq data from defined regions of both human and mouse brain will be analyzed using the new rMATS analysis tool to create a large statistically robust database of differential gene expression and alternative pre-mRNA splicing between males and females. Expression and splicing changes will be correlated with changes in PTBP1/2 mRNA and Xist across the same datasets to define genes potentially regulated by these molecules at the transcriptional and post- transcriptional levels. Female specific patterns of expression and splicing caused by the XX genotype will be distinguished from events driven by female hormones using four core genotype mice. Xist targeting will be confirmed using conditional Xist alleles that allow either removal or activation of Xist during brain development and measurement of the resulting changes in splicing. The expression of Xist relative to PTBP2 will be quantified over neuronal differentiation in culture. The PTBP targeting of Xist-dependent changes in splicing will be confirmed in PTBP2 knockout and PTBP1 transgenic mice, and by transcriptome-wide binding analyses by iCLIP. Alternative splicing is a widespread mechanism of gene regulation, but has been only minimally examined in relation to the XX genotype of female cells. Using sophisticated new genome-wide methods and molecular tools, these studies promise to identify new genetic determinants of sexual dimorphism in the mammalian brain and to elucidate their underlying molecular mechanisms. In the longer term, the identified molecular changes driven by Xist and PTBP will provide entrée to the examination of the functional consequences of these dimorphisms."
"9531962","Abstract Disruption in metabolic homeostasis is increasingly recognized as the root cause of obesity, insulin resistance, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases. Current efforts on prevention and therapies are focused on key components that mediate nutrient utilization, interconversion and storage. However, metabolic diseases are complex in nature with disruption in multiple pathways, often requiring progressively more complex combination therapies. Novel intervention that is effective both as a preventative method and to augment therapy is urgently needed. The circadian regulation of metabolism and physiology offer a novel promising avenue for the prevention and the treatment of these diseases. There is growing evidence that disruption of natural circadian rhythm in sleep and nutrition as occurs in people doing shiftwork is associated with increased incidence of metabolic diseases in humans. Furthermore, even among the general population, the daily rhythm of sleep and nutrition is significantly disrupted. Therefore, behavioral changes that sustain robust circadian function are considered to be beneficial against challenges that predispose to metabolic diseases. Time-restricted feeding (TRF), in which animals are fed within an 8-12 hour time interval during their natural circadian wakeful hours is both preventative and therapeutic against metabolic diseases in both mice and insects. There is growing precedence that the time of food intake has a profound impact on body weight regulation in humans. While these preliminary findings are encouraging, major questions remain to be answered before any potential human translation. Is TRF beneficial under a shiftwork paradigm that chronically disrupts circadian rhythm? And what are the potential mechanisms underlying TRF benefits? This proposal will test these questions in mice that are effectively used to model circadian rhythm disruption and metabolic diseases."
"9458687","Project Summary - CD1 Presentation of Self Lipids to Human T cells ? D. Branch Moody T cells play a central role in the pathogenesis of human autoimmune diseases, including allergy and drug hypersensitivity syndromes. For decades studies of T cell autoantigens have emphasized peptide antigens bound to MHC proteins. This proposal investigates the basis by which self lipid antigens bind to human CD1 antigen presenting molecules, leading to autoreactive T cell responses. This competing renewal builds on an existing program of development that has invented human CD1a and CD1b tetramers and used them to discover previously unknown lipid autoantigens for T cells, including squalene and phosphatidylglycerol. To provide a general basis for lipid epitope mapping, we will use mass spectrometry to broadly identify many hundreds of self lipids that bind to CD1 proteins in human cells. Using tetramers, we will identify and clone autoreactive T cell receptors and measure their binding to CD1-self lipid complexes. Building on recently published studies showing that CD1a autoreactive T cells are increased in patients with allergy syndromes, we will measure CD1a-reactive T cell responses in human cohorts. Finally, we will investigate a new mechanism by which CD1a proteins present common skin irritants from clinical patch tests to T cells, bypassing mechanisms that relate to peptide haptenization. Overall, these studies will extend the spectrum of natural T cell autoantigens to include self lipids and investigate their roles in common allergic diseases."
"9509358","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a Mentored Scientist Career Development Award application for Dr. Tina L. Sumpter, Research Instructor in the Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Sumpter's prior training focused on the underlying molecular mechanisms of tolerance induction to non-self-antigens in the allogeneic system. Following, her appointment in the Department of Dermatology, Dr. Sumpter studied the mechanisms of cutaneous inflammation, and the role of neuro-immune regulation of mast cell (MCs). She focused on initiation and maintenance of IgE-mediated MC activation relevant for anaphylaxis and atopic dermatitis (AD). This award will support additional training in facets of skin biology, immunology and MC function, and translational research and in management, leadership and grantsmanship. This training is necessary for Dr. Sumpter's transition to an independent investigator studying allergic inflammation in the skin.  This application will further analyze the mechanisms of MC activation specifically in AD, a common, debilitating skin disease that represents a serious health problem. We will delineate the initiatio of pathogenic T cell responses and local tissue damage aggravated by IgE-Ag activated MCs. AD correlates with increased secretion of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides and we will analyze their role in the initiation and maintenance of disease. Specifically, we will analyze the molecula pathways following MC activation by substance P, (SP) and/or hemokinin-1 (HK-1), both agonists of the neurokinin-1 and -2 receptors (NK1R and NK2R, respectively) expressed in MC. Indeed, NK1R and NK2R affect MC function, and neuro-immune regulation via these receptors is central in the pathologic immune responses of AD. This proposal will test the hypothesis that interfering with neuro-immune MC activation will minimize the immune component of AD. Our hypothesis will be tested in three aims. Aim 1 will analyze the role of intracellular pathways initiated by neuropeptides in mast cell activation. Aim 2 delineates the function of the NK2R in mast cell function in vitro and in vivo. Aim 3, using two in vivo AD models will delineate the role of NKR in the cellular and molecular cascades relevant for AD. Furthermore, it will assess the therapeutic potential of NK receptor manipulation in AD.

CDH is a birth defect which occurs in 1/3000 live births, and has a high mortality and morbidity, with survivors requiring high technology-driven interventional perinatal care in tertiary or quarternary neonatal intensive care units. 40% of CDH patients have multiple anomalies in addition to CDH, but as many as 60% are isolated with the potential for increased survival if we can improve the associated lung hypoplasia responsible for its high morbidity. The societal and individual burden of CDH can hopefully be lessened by reducing the patient and family stresses caused by the considerable morbidity and mortality, as well as the cost of care, coincident with this birth defect. If substantial pulmonary differentiation can be induced to occur in the lung postnatally, the use of Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) and aggressive ventilatory management may be reduced, thus protecting fragile lungs from secondary barotrauma and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.  To affect a salutary change, we plan to continue to employ genomic methods such as Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH), and Whole Genomic Sequencing (WGS), and to integrate variant findings with data from expression analyses of developing diaphragm and lung tissues in mouse models, and with diaphragm biopsies from human CDH patients. WES, WGS, and aCGH data will be continually ascertained and analyzed on a clinically well characterized cohort of singletons and parent/child trios, as well as rare extended families. It is the goal of this P01 to use this growing cohort and our analytic approach to generate candidate genes that will yield important clues as to the molecular pathogenesis of CDH, particularly after integrating the highest priority candidates into molecular pathways. PROJECT I: Genomic and gene expression analyses to discover human CHD genes and pathways. PROJECT II: Mouse models will elucidate genetics of CDH and associated pulmonary defects and identify clinically relevant targets. PROJECT III: Functional evaluation of CDH patient gene variants in vitro and in select animal models."
"9536692","Endochondral ossification is the process by which long bones, ribs, vertebrae and other skeletal elements form and grow during embryogenesis and after birth. During this process, preskeletal mesenchymal cells condense and differentiate into cartilaginous anlaga that provide the template and framework of the future skeleton. Within these incipient structures, the chondrocytes become organized in growth plates, undergo maturation and hypertrophy, and pave the way for endochondral bone formation. This critical multi- step process is recapitulated in healing of most bone fractures, but can also be usurped in pathologies such as heterotopic ossification. HO consists of formation of endochondral bone that forms and accumulates at ectopic sites and causes many health problems. One form of HO is common and non-genetic and is triggered by trauma, invasive surgeries and ensuing inflammation. A congenital, severe and often fatal form of HO is initiated by local flare-ups and is driven by activating mutations in ACVR1 encoding the type I bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor ALK2. Up until recently, the acquired and congenital forms of HO were thought to follow the same pathogenic cascade given that they both involve an initial inflammatory stage and a subsequent endochondral process. However, recent studies by others suggested that congenital HO is caused by activin A, normally an antagonist of BMP/canonical signaling that in this condition, however, would interact with mutant ALK2 and elicit pSMAD1/5/8 signaling. If correct, the data would imply that genetic and non- genetic forms of HO are distinct processes distinguishable by the manner in which they are triggered at cell level and may require distinct therapies. Because we have long been working on the pathogenesis of genetic and non-genetic forms of HO and have a vested interest, we carried out preliminary studies to further assess those recent studies. We found that activin A is actually abundantly expressed in both non-genetic and genetic HO in mouse models, greatly stimulates chondrogenesis in wild type preskeletal mesenchymal cells, and promotes HO in wild type mice. These and other data lead to the central premise of this project that both genetic and non-genetic forms of HO involve, and are promoted by, activin A. The greater severity of genetic HO would result from greater responsiveness of mutant chondrogenic progenitors to activin A and unruly mutant ALK2 signaling and action, but both non-genetic and genetic forms of HO would be amenable to an anti-activin A-based therapy. Our Aims are: (1) To clarify the mechanisms of activin A action in chondrogenesis; (2) To determine activin A receptor composition and cell surface dynamics; and (3) To genetically test the roles of activin A in HO and its usefulness as a therapy target. We anticipate this project will provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of genetic and non-genetic forms of HO and also fundamental basic insights into the regulation of endochondral ossification. It will also provide a springboard toward an effective universal therapy for HO in both children and adults."
"9515937","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For the past several years, my lab has made key discoveries of the paracellular channel underlying renal calcium and magnesium handling. At the center of our story is a key tight junction protein complex from the kidney that comprises of three claudin proteins: claudin-14, claudin-16 and claudin-19. Human mutations in claudin-16 and claudin-19 cause the hereditary disease FHHNC (Familial Hypomagnesemia with Hypercalciuria and Nephrocalcinosis). Human SNPs in claudin-14 are associated with kidney stone diseases according to genome-wide association criteria. This proposal entitled Biochemical and biophysical nature of claudin-16 and claudin-19 channels will test the central hypothesis that the changes in paracellular permeabilities through claudin expression, function, interaction and combination underlie the key signaling functions of CaSR and PTH to regulate renal calcium and magnesium reabsorption. There are three aims in this proposal. Aim 1 will elucidate the biochemical and biophysical basis of claudin-14, -16 and -19 functions in the kidney. We will use a range of biochemical and biophysical approaches with emphasis on a novel recording approach established by our lab based upon Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy (SICM). SICM has, for the first time, allowed us to reveal paracellular permeabilities at submicron resolution. Aim 2 will elucidate the regulatory basis for claudin in response to CaSR and PTH signaling. We will generate two key mouse models - TALH specific CaSR or PTH1R KO mice to decipher the CaSR and PTH specific regulation of claudins. We will also study how CaSR and PTH signaling cross talk in the kidney using double CaSR/PTH1R KO or a well-established pharmacological approach. Aim 3 will determine the mechanistic role of claudin in renal calcium handling. The renal transport function of claudin monomer or oligomer will be determined using combinatorial knockout approaches based upon the claudin KO mouse models we have established - claudin-14, -16, -19 single, double and triple KO and claudin- 14 overexpression mice. We will also study how PTH, CaSR and microRNA alter paracellular permeabilities based upon changes in claudin expression, function, interaction, and combination using single nephron perfusion techniques."
"9394919","Background: This application is for a five-year Career Development Award (CDA) to support my transition to becoming an independent VA health services researcher. Career plan: To successfully achieve my career goal of improving Veterans' health and quality of life by enhancing the reach and effectiveness of behavioral sleep interventions, I need further mentored training and content expertise in chronic pain and health services research, including qualitative methodologies, pragmatic randomized trials, and implementation science, including social marketing theory. I will achieve these objectives through formal coursework, seminars, clinical training, and mentorship from Melissa Polusny, PhD (primary mentor; Minneapolis VA Health Care System, MVAHCS), Erin Krebs, MD, MPH (MVAHCS), Michael Vitiello, PhD (University of Washington), and Hildi Hagedorn, PhD (MVAHCS). Research plan: Specific aims include 1) understanding the experience of sleep treatment in comorbid chronic pain and insomnia, 2) optimizing cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) delivery for patients with chronic pain and insomnia, and 3) increasing demand for CBT-I among patients with chronic pain and their primary care providers. Projects include a qualitative interview study with patient and CBT-I provider dyads following completion or drop-out from CBT-I to inform hypotheses about strategies to eliminate barriers to adherence. I will use these findings to draft a package of adherence-promoting adaptations for patients with chronic pain. A pilot feasibility study will be used to finalize the adherence package and test feasibility of trial procedures to prepare for a future pragmatic randomized clinical trial. The final project is a local implementation study to test a social marketing campaign to increase demand for CBT-I among patients with chronic pain by increasing patient and primary care provider awareness and positive attitudes toward CBT-I. The social marketing campaign developed in this study will be an important component of a multifaceted implementation intervention that will be tested in a future multisite trial. The first two projects will result in a package of adherence-promoting adaptations to be added to CBT-I for patients with chronic pain. It is likely that components of the adherence package will inform broader efforts to enhance CBT-I adherence in all patients with insomnia, both those with and without chronic pain, as well as adherence to other cognitive behavioral therapies. The final CDA project will result in a social marketing campaign designed to increase demand for CBT-I among patients with chronic pain. We expect that components of the social marketing campaign can also be used as part of broader campaigns to disseminate CBT-I widely among patients with insomnia, leading to higher-rates of guideline-concordant care. Significance and innovation: CBT-I is a highly effective and safe treatment for improving sleep and pain outcomes and represents a promising alternative to pharmacologic treatments for pain and sleep, which are associated with serious adverse events. The proposed research utilizes intervention mapping and social marketing theories to identify evidence-based strategies to increase demand and optimize CBT-I delivery for patients with chronic pain. This work is responsive to calls by VA and national/international organizations to address barriers to full implementation of CBT-I and to enhance adherence to cognitive behavioral treatments."
"9461500","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ciliogenesis defects are central to kidney diseases including cystic kidney disease and nephronophthisis, two major causes of kidney failure in children and adults. The pathogenic mechanisms in ciliopathies remain puzzling however since cyst formation is delayed and highly focal in postnatal conditional PKD knockout models. It is now clear that renal injury significantly exacerbates cystic disease in the context of cilia defect, suggesting that ciliogenic responses may play a key role in tubule regeneration. Our finding that ciliogenic transcription factors FOXJ1 and rfx2 are rapidly induced by injury or mechanical stretch suggests a new paradigm for understanding cystic disease where ciliogenesis may be required for kidney tubule homeostasis and regeneration after injury. We also find that cell stretch is by itself sufficient to stimulate cell proliferation, further implicating mechanosensingin tubule repair. Our data together with the newly established role of purinergic signaling in kidney tubule mechanosensing suggests a strong link between cell stretch, purinergic signaling, proliferation and transcriptional activation of ciliogenesis. The central hypothesis of this proposl is that kidney tubules lacking the ability to stimulate or maintain ciliogenesis, due to cilia gene mutation, cannot undergo proper repair and are predisposed to cyst formation. This proposal aims to identify signaling pathways that control ciliogenesis in response to injury and stretch and directly link these pathways to transcriptional control of FOXJ1 and rfx2. We will also determine whether stretch induced ciliogenesis and cell proliferation are signaled by the same or divergent pathways. The transcriptional responses to stretch and the significance of foxj1 expression to tubule regeneration will also be examined in mouse models. If successful, this work would integrate tubule injury and mechanosensory signaling pathways with transcriptional control of ciliogenesis and reveal new elements of tubule homeostasis central to kidney disease."

"9533708","Protease Activated Receptor Type 2 Targeting for Migraine Pain PIs: Theodore Price, Gregory Dussor, Josef Vagner and Scott Boitano ABSTRACT  Migraine is the most common neurological disorder, the 3rd most common disease on earth, and the 8th most disabling. Currently available treatments fail to effectively manage migraine in most patients. Development of new therapeutics has been slow due in large part to a poor understanding of the underlying pathology of migraine. Endogenous proteases, released in the meninges by resident mast cells, have been proposed as a potential driver of migraine pain via an action on protease activated receptor type 2 (PAR2). Unfortunately the evidence for this mechanism relies on imprecise pharmacological tools and lacks genetic validation. The central hypothesis of this multi-PI research program is that PAR2 expression in nociceptors that project to the meninges plays a key role in the pathogenesis of migraine pain by linking meningeal protease release to sensitization of the trigeminal nociceptive system. The primary objectives of this proposal are to develop next generation PAR2 antagonists, to use these tools to validate PAR2 as a migraine pain target and to use mouse genetics to identify the specific role of PAR2 expression in meningeal projecting nociceptors to migraine pain. Our first aim will be to use our established PAR2 development pipeline to design new PAR2 antagonists with improved drug-like properties to probe PAR2 function in the context of a mouse model of migraine pain. Our second aim will use pharmacological tools in a novel mouse migraine model to further understand the potential role of PAR2 in migraine and signaling pathways engaged by PAR2 to evoke pain from the dura. Our final aim will use mouse genetics to study the cell type-specific role of PAR2 in migraine pain. Our work will result in: 1) the discovery and development of novel high potency antagonists for PAR2; 2) the development of an innovative new target for migraine pain; and 3) provide the first genetic verification of the cell type-specific action of PAR2 in the pain pathway. Taken together, successful studies will provide a preclinical rationale for the further development and testing of PAR2 ligands for the treatment of migraine and other forms of pain."
"9481304","Much of science, including biomedical science, consists of discovering and modeling causal relationships. Increasingly, biomedical scientists have available multiple complex data types and a very large number of samples, each of which has an enormous number of measurements recorded.. There is a pressing need for algorithms that can efficiently discover causal relationships from large and diverse types of biomedical data and background knowledge. In the past 25 years, tremendous progress has been made in developing general computational methods for representing and discovering causal knowledge from data. However, these methods are not readily available, nor easy to use by biomedical scientists, and they have not been designed to exploit the increasingly Big Data available for analysis. The proposed Center will create a computer ecosystem through which to implement and apply an integrated set of tools, new and repurposed, that support the representation and discovery of causal knowledge from large and complex biomedical data. These computational approaches will be accessible to a wide variety of biomedical researchers, data analysts, and data scientists who might not otherwise take advantage of them. Three very different biomedical problems will drive the development of the methods, tools, and interactive system architecture. While we anticipate that new biomedical discoveries will be made in each of these problem areas using the methods developed by the Center, the longer-term impact will result from the development of the computational technology itself, which will be generalizable to the full spectrum of biomedical research. The Center will be very active in the sharing of these knowledge, methods, and tools through a rich offering of training activities and through engagement with other Centers in the consortium."
"9495762","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and the mutation is frequently seen in apparent sporadic patients. The underlying mechanisms by which the C9ORF72 HRE causes ?c9FTD/ALS? are poorly defined. Multiple studies, including our own, support a gain-of-function mechanism of neurotoxicity mediated by the HRE. Expanded repeats may generate toxic RNAs that sequester RNA-binding proteins. They may also be translated via repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation into toxic ?c9RAN proteins? of repeating dipeptides. Furthermore, multiple studies from our lab and others suggest that disruption of the nuclear pore and/or nucleocytoplasmic transport is a primary cause of neurodegeneration in yeast, fly, and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell models of c9FTD/ALS. In addition, our recent use of c9FTD/ALS iPS cell-derived neurons (iPSN) suggests they are a valuable and highly relevant preclinical model to uncover candidate therapies. This proposal will investigate the mechanism by which the C9ORF72 HRE disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport and nuclear pores utilizing complementary models, which will include c9FTD/ALS iPSN and patient brain tissues, as well as brain tissue from (G4C2)66 mice (generated by Project 2), an in vivo model that recapitulates behavioral and neuropathological features of c9FTD/ALS. Our data suggest the defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport are fundamental events coupled with neurodegeneration in c9FTD/ALS. The proposed studies, first in iPSN and then validated in vivo with Project 2, will establish whether candidate therapies emerging from Project 1 are able to mitigate such detrimental defects. First, we will comprehensively investigate nuclear pore complex (NPC) function and pathology in c9FTD/ALS iPSN and rodent models. These experiments will define the specific role of NPC components in c9FTD/ALS pathophysiology and highlight targets worthiest of experimental manipulation or monitoring for molecular efficacy. Findings from these studies will guide our efforts to identify therapeutic strategies that mitigate nuclear pore dysfunction and pathology in c9FTD/ALS iPSN and rodent models. Such strategies will include genetic expression of selected nucleoporins or other mediators of nucleocytoplasmic transport (e.g. RanGAP1), and r(G4C2)exp-binding small molecules from Project 1. Finally, we will identify therapeutic strategies that rescue the heightened susceptibility of c9FTD/ALS iPSN to cellular stressors. C9ORF72 HRE toxicity may occur via disruption of NPC function and other events distal to the mutation that impair cellular function. These studies will provide a fundamentally important general readout of the therapeutic benefit of blocking HRE toxicity using r(G4C2)exp-binding small molecules or manipulating other mechanistic targets identified as part of our proposed studies."

"9591363","Summary/Abstract: Ticks are hematophagous ectoparasites with worldwide public health and veterinary importance. The success of their life strategy can be attributed, in part, to anti-inflammatory salivary proteins that inhibit host immunity and facilitate pathogen transmission. As an example, we recently discovered a novel mechanism of immune evasion by which the Ixodes scapularis salivary protein Sialostatin L2 inhibits activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome. The NLRC4 inflammasome is a protein scaffold that regulates maturation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1? and IL-18 through the enzyme caspase-1. We demonstrated that Sialostatin L2 binds to the mammalian host protein Annexin A2. Upon infection with the rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Sialostatin L2 impairs assembly of the NLRC4 inflammasome. How tick effector molecules, such as Sialostatin L2, are released during blood-feeding continues to be unknown. In what manner pathogens, such as A. phagocytophilum, influence the delivery of tick molecules to the mammalian host remain elusive. Whether the lymphatic system, a network of circulatory vessels, provides a rapid mechanism of dissemination for immunological information during tick blood-feeding remains undetermined. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that function in intercellular communication, facilitating host immune modulation. For this R01 application, we show that I. scapularis exosomes interact with host immune cells and transport anti-inflammatory tick salivary proteins. We report that A. phagocytophilum alters the oxidative state of molecules within exosomes. Finally, we demonstrate that the lymphatic system acts as a conduit where the release of tick proteins may affect inflammation. Accordingly, our central hypothesis states that the lymphatic system plays a critical role in modulating inflammation during tick feeding; and that exosomes facilitate intercommunication between I. scapularis and the mammalian host. Aim#1 of this proposal will identify anti- inflammatory molecules within tick exosomes. Aim#2 will define oxidative post-translational modifications within tick exosomes. Aim#3 will evaluate the role of the lymphatic system during tick feeding. Altogether, this research will determine how tick-derived exosomes transport salivary proteins; investigate the underlying mechanisms by which the rickettsial pathogen A. phagocytophilum affects exosomes; and reveal whether the lymphatic system carries tick-derived molecules. As ticks and other arthropods transmit many human pathogens during feeding, solving this intriguing scientific question will provide critical insights to the vector biology community."
"9582354","PROJECT SUMMARY Most human pathogens enter via mucosal routes. Yet, there are few licensed mucosal vaccines. Thus, there is a need for new vaccine technologies and/or adjuvants that stimulate protective immunity at mucosal sites. We have developed a novel recombinant mucosal vaccine platform. The efficacy of this vaccine platform has been demonstrated using a human Fc?RI (hFc?RI)-specific fusion protein (FP) consisting of pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) antigen (Ag) targeted to hFc?RI. This FP enhances immunogenicity and protection against mucosal S. pneumoniae (Sp) challenge when administered without adjuvant intranasally (i.n.) to hFc?RI transgenic mice. We hypothesize that a more potent adjuvant-free mucosal vaccine platform can be produced by generating a dual human FcRn (hFcRn)/hFc?RI-targeted-Ag FP, which enhances FcRn-mediated transepithelial Ag transport to the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and subsequent hFc?RI-mediated Ag presentation and T cell activation within the NALT. In this regard, such a dual-targeted FP has been generated by adding a hFcRn targeting sequence to the hFc?RI-specific PspA-containing FP. This novel FP will now be evaluated for its ability to enhance protective efficacy, transepithelial transport of Ag to the NALT, and Ag presentation/T cell activation within the NALT utilizing a hFcRn/hFc?RI-expressing mouse model. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will identify the optimal (most protective) FP configuration and immunization regimen. The hFc?RI-targeted PspA FP or anti-hFcRn/hFc?RI-PspA FP, as well as non-targeted PspA, will be administered to wildtype, hFc?RI, hFcRn, or hFcRn/hFc?RI-expressing mice at varying doses i.n. in the presence and absence of MPLA adjuvant. Protection against Sp challenge, as well as PspA-specific T and B cell responses, and bacterial burden, will be measured. The optimal immunization regimen will be identified based primarily on superior protection, but also optimal B and T cell responses. In Aim 2, we will identify the functional mechanisms involved in the FP-enhanced immunity/protection, as well as evaluate the safety of FP vaccination. We will examine FcRn binding and transepithelial transport of FPs in vitro and in vivo, FP binding to hFcR on APCs, FP internalization by APCs, and the ability of FPs to induce DC maturation and FP- enhanced Ag presentation/T cell activation. Safety parameters to be assessed will include health following vaccination, histological changes, and FP trafficking to the brain. Importantly, the above Aims will be carried out by a uniquely qualified investigative team with extensive expertise in FcRn and Fc?RI biology, as well as vaccine development and testing. Ultimately, these studies will be the first major step in establishing this novel/innovative vaccine platform as a viable adjuvant-free approach to mucosal vaccination. Furthermore, given the strong focus of vaccine research today on adjuvant discovery, maximizing the potency of this adjuvant-free vaccine platform will be crucial in changing perceptions regarding the requirement for adjuvant.  "
"9594366","PROJECT SUMMARY Salmonellosis continues to be a major Public Health challenge. Salmonella enterica encompasses multiple serovars that are associated with distinct pathogenic features and host specificities. S. enterica serovar Typhi for example, is the cause of typhoid fever, a systemic disease of humans that leads to an estimated 200,000 deaths worldwide. In contrast, the broad host S. Typhimurium causes limited gastroenteritis and is one of the most common causes of food-borne illnesses in the industrialized world. The pathogenicity of all S. enterica serovars requires the activity of two type III protein secretion systems (T3SS) encoded within their pathogenicity islands 1 and 2. These T3SSs direct the translocation of a battery of bacterial effectors with the capacity to modulate a variety of cellular functions. Working in conjunction with one another, these effectors modulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics, host-cell gene expression, vesicle trafficking, and innate and acquired immune responses, thus allowing Salmonella to gain access to and replicate within host cells, avoid host defenses, induce intestinal inflammation, and reach deeper tissues. Despite the significant progress, however, much remains to be learned as the biochemical activities and/or relevant cellular targets of many Salmonella effectors remain uncharacterized. The objectives of this proposed research is to study the functional interface between Salmonella and its host shaped by the activities of T3SS effectors. More specifically, we intend to define the mechanisms by which the Salmonella T3SS effectors modulate signaling pathways leading to intestinal inflammation, a critical step in its pathogenesis. In addition, we will study the mechanism by which a recently discovered cell intrinsic host defense pathway restricts Salmonella intracellular replication. These studies will advance the understanding of the cell biology of Salmonella enterica infections and potentially facilitate the development of novel therapeutic and prevention strategies. Furthermore, these studies may establish new paradigms of host-pathogen interactions that may be applicable to other important pathogens that have evolved close associations with their respective hosts."

Core B will facilitate the performance of each project by centralizing animal care including maintenance of mouse and rat colonies (breeding and colony expansion) of animals harboring genetic mutations, by maintaining bacterial stocks of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and by generating P. aeruginosa-induced lung injury in rats and mice. Academic component: Throughout previous funding cycles, Core B has adapted to the ever-changing needs of the Projects by generating new reagents (e.g. providing pulmonary endothelial cells from genetically modified rats and mice) or platforms (e.g. providing an experimental rodent model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced pneumonia and sepsis). During the current cycle, the Core has developed a novel experimental platform -Monolayer Stress Microscopy- to assess endothelial cell mechanics via visualization of forces occurring among cells and their subjacent substrate. In addition, the Core has generated mouse and rat decellularized lung bio-scaffolds that will serve as a platform for examining endothelial cell heterogeneity. Synergy with Projects and Scientific Cores: In collaboration with Core D (BioImaging and BioTechnology Implementation Core), pulmonary endothelial cells and isolated lung tissues will be provided for 3D, 4D, and 5D imaging analyses. Scientifically, the analysis of monolayer mechanical forces and the generation of lung scaffolds will become fundamental for data- and hypothesis- generation by providing innovative platforms to all Projects and Cores. In this capacity, scaffolds repopulated with genetically modified cells (provided from Core C) will be imaged using the novel approaches developed by Core D and the newly-acquired information will be disseminated in coordination with Core A (administrative Core)."
"9497761","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Autoimmunity Center of Excellence based at the Baylor Institute for Immunology Research in Dallas, Texas aims at 1) advancing the knowledge of pathways and mechanisms that contribute to the development and amplification of Human Systemic Autoimmunity, and 2) developing assays and tools to monitor these dysfunctional pathways in patients. The specific proposed research focuses on characterizing triggers, sensors and helpers of systemic autoimmunity. It capitalizes on the availability of samples from pediatric patients, who manifest disease early in life, often present extreme phenotypes and lack co-morbidities that confound the phenotypes. It will focus on diseases where breakdown of tolerance to Nucleic Acids (NAs) and dysregulated production of Type I Interferon (IFN) and/or Follicular Helper T cells (Tfh) play central pathogenic roles. While the initial focus will be the study of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), extrapolation of the Center findings to other systemic autoimmune disease scenarios will be pursued.     To this end, BIIR has gathered a highly integrated multidisciplinary team composed of scientists     (including immunologists, molecular biologists, bioinformaticians, software engineers) and Physician-     Scientists/Clinicians. This multidisciplinary team has worked efficiently together for several years at bed-to bench and bench-to-bed translation to meet the challenges of Human Immunology and Medicine. BIIR has also established strong national and international collaborations. The Center will employ in vitro culture techniques using patient cells and knock-down assays of cell lines and primary human cells, immune profiling strategies reflecting human immune status and function, and an extensive infrastructure to support patient-based studies. Throughout the performance of these mechanistic studies, BIIR recognized the fundamental value of data sharing, data integration and data visualization. Thus, significant efforts have been  placed at developing the right bioinformatics and software tools to make possible that clinical and research data provide the most useful information to advance clinical and basic discoveries.

The proposed research focuses on triggers, sensors, and helpers of systemic autoimmunity and capitalizes on the availability of samples from pediatric patients who often have extreme cases of autoimmune disease.          Principal Project: Novel Pathogenic Roles for Interferon and Autoantibodies in Human SLE     Project Leader (PL): Virginia Pascual          DESCRIPTION (as provided by applicant): Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by widespread inflammation and development of autoantibodies against nucleic acids (NAs). SLE pathogenesis is not fully understood but genomic studies support an interplay between innate and adaptive immunity. Pathogenic loops involving immune complex(IC)-containing NAs that activate innate immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), platelets and neutrophils through the endosomal TLR pathway result in plasmacytoid DC (pDC) activation and release of type I IFN. Excessive production and/or sensing of NAs is emerging as a fundamental and upstream event in SLE, and over-expression of IFN-inducible transcriptional signatures is a universal finding, especially in early onset SLE. We and others recently reported that neutrophils release DNA-protein complexes that activate pDCs, thus acting as Danger-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs). DAMPS are extruded upon neutrophil activation with SLE immune complexes (ICs) and directly activate pDCs in an FcB-independent and TLR9-dependent manner. Our preliminary data now show that these DAMPs are composed of damaged (oxidized) mitochondrial DNA-protein complexes (mtDAMPs) released upon type I IFN and anti-Sm/RNP mediated endosomal TLR7 activation of neutrophils. This combination of     stimuli impairs the detoxification of oxidized mtDNA through lysosomal degradation, which is a fundamental step leading to the extrusion of interferogenic mtDAMPs. Here, we propose 1) to characterize the basic mechanisms that lead to neutrophil mitochondrial damage and release of mtDAMPs in SLE, 2) to identify the interferogenic components of mtDAMPs and the mechanisms responsible for their internalization in pDCs, and 3) to characterize the effects of SLE mtDAMPs on non-hemopoietic cells that become the target of inflammation in SLE, especially endothelial cells. Overall, these studies will provide a better understanding of how breakdown of tolerance to NAs and dysregulation of the IFN pathway are interconnected and amplify each other. These studies will bring novel insight into SLE autoantibody pathogenic roles and perpetuation of IFN-amplification loops.          RELEVANCE: Our work supports a previously unsuspected role for neutrophils as a link between lupus-specific nucleic acid-recognizing antibodies and amplification loops for type I IFN production and eventually B cell help. Completion of the project goals will lead to better understanding of these pathways and to the identification of novel therapeutic targets."
"9507141","PROJECT SUMMARY  With 10 million incident cases and 1.5 million deaths every year, tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the world's deadliest communicable diseases, and constitutes a significant burden on resource-limited countries. Increasing emergence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) strains calls for the development of new and improved treatment options. M.tb persists within its host by using a plethora of complex strategies to modify both its intracellular and local tissue environment that facilitates its survival. Recent efforts have therefore focused on host-directed therapies (HDT) that modulate immune responses to M.tb in favor of the host. Due to the fact that the drug pipeline for TB drugs is sparse, there has also been a resurgence of interest in repurposing drugs that are already FDA-approved. We recently found that pyrazinamide (PZA), an important component of standard TB therapy, inhibits the host enzyme Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase-1 (PARP-1), a key immune regulator required for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-?) production and NF-?B target gene expression. PARP- 1 activation is prolonged and sustained in pathophysiological conditions such as cancers and chronic inflammations. Therapeutic inhibition of PARPs is therefore being pursued as a promising anti-cancer and anti- inflammatory strategy. Although a direct role of PARP-1 in the pathology of TB is not yet fully established, the structure of PZA is similar to nicotinamide (NAM), a well-known PARP inhibitor. This proposal therefore aims to determine the role of PARP-1 in the pathogenesis of TB and to test the efficacy of FDA-approved PARP-1 inhibitors olaparib, rucaprib and niraparib, as well as talazoparib which is currently in clinical trials, in mouse models of TB. Results from the proposed study will help to determine if PARP-1 inhibition presents a viable but unexplored strategy to improving the treatment of TB. A better understanding of the role of PARP-1 and the mechanism of inhibition by PZA in M.tb infection promises new insight into pathogenesis of TB and disease control and could lead to other new therapies for the treatment of drug-susceptible as well as drug-resistant strains of M.tb."
"9529287","Project Summary Impaired decision making is observed in almost all mental disorders. Many types of decisions rely on the gradual accumulation of evidence for the alternatives under consideration. In order to understand the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie evidence accumulation and develop targeted treatments when this process is impaired, we must first identify the neural circuit elements involved. An extensive body of research in primates and rodents has posited that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) plays an important role in this process, but recent work has called into question the nature of this role. The long-term goal of this research is to first clarify the specific role of PPC for evidence accumulation as a foundation to understand the neural mechanisms that control the natural adaptability of decision policies. The proposed experiments will use a rat model system to examine the primary hypotheses for PPC's role that are consistent with the existing literature. The first aim will test whether PPC plays a direct but non-obligatory role in accumulation-based perceptual decision making. This will be made possible with the use of high temporal resolution optogenetic manipulations to perturb neural activity in PPC during evidence accumulation on randomly interleaved trials. The second aim will test whether PPC plays a role in decision commitment during perceptual decision making rather than a direct role in evidence accumulation. This will be achieved using a free response (reaction time) perceptual decision task where rats control the timing of decision commitment. This work is significant for elucidating the role of PPC, a brain region thought to be critical in decision making. The approach is innovative because it develops a conceptual framework for understanding decision processes at a single trial level in situations where subjects control when they respond in combination with optogenetic techniques in rodentsp to answer a previously inaccessible question. In the long term, we expect this research to harness both primate and rodent model systems to produce a detailed understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie evidence accumulation, decision commitment, and flexible control of both in decision making. The objective is to develop principled treatments targeted to specific neural circuits for the impairments to decision making associated with mental disorders."
"9426472","Background. Frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) can cause LV dysfunction (CM), referred to as PVC-cardiomyopathy (PVC-CM). The mechanism responsible and the impact of PVC coupling interval (prematurity) are unclear. Suspected triggers are post-extrasystolic potentiation and LV dyssynchrony. Hypotheses. Our four working hypotheses are: 1) Post-extrasystolic potentiation, associated with PVCs, is a key trigger responsible for PVC-CM. LV dysfunction (Aim 1), impaired EC coupling and dyad remodeling (Aim 2) are greater in early- rather than late-coupled PVCs since this phenomenon is more prominent in early- rather than late-coupled PVCs; 2) Impaired EC coupling in PVC-CM is due to changes in JPH-2 and Cav1.2 pathways (Fig.1); 3) Early changes in dyad, JPH-2 and Cav1.2 pathways precede the development of this CM and the recovery of LV function after PVC cessation, providing evidence that these changes are a primary cause of CM (Aim 2); and 4) Baseline clinical and structural / molecular phenotype can identify those animals that will develop PVC-CM when exposed to 33% PVC burden. Aim 1. Evaluate the impact of post-extrasystolic potentiation and PVC coupling interval in the development of LV dysfunction associated with chronic exposure to frequent PVCs (PVC-CM). Aim 2. Determine the temporal structural and molecular changes responsible for decrease in Ca2+ release and Junctophylin-2, and their role on the pathophysiology of PVC-CM and recovery upon PVC cessation. Aim 3. Identify baseline echocardiographic, hemodynamic and molecular features that can predict the development of, or resilience to PVC-CM despite identical ventricular ectopy. Methods. 56 animals will undergo pacemaker implant to reproduce frequent ventricular ectopy (PVCs). They will be randomized to one of 4 groups: 1) early-coupled 50% PVCs (n=13), 2) late-coupled 50% PVCs (n=13), 3) early-coupled PVCs 33% PVCs (n=18), or 4) control (n=12) groups. At the end of a 12-week PVC period, a recovery phase (disabling PVCs) will be allowed in 6 animals of each group exposed to 50% burden and sham group (Fig. 6). Serial cardiac evaluation and biopsies will allow us to assess LV function, dyad structure, Ca2+ transients (EC coupling), changes in JPH-2 and Cav1.2 expression, function and distribution and their mediators at baseline and different time points of PVC-CM in all groups. Significance. This study will: 1) provide an understanding of the role of post-extrasystolic potentiation and LV dyssynchrony in the mechanism of PVC-CM; 2) assess the impact of PVC coupling interval in the development or severity of PVC-CM, 3) identify molecular mechanisms behind impaired EC coupling in PVC-CM and 4) identify baseline clinical and molecular phenotypes that distinguish patients at risk to develop PVC-CM. Understanding the mechanism of PVC-CM will help us to identify high-risk patients for development of PVC- CM, but most importantly find future targets to prevent and treat subjects with PVC-CM."
"9474147","ABSTRACT This is the first submission of this application for competitive renewal of the third cycle of the Adolescent Health Promotion Research Training Program at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The goal of the program is to provide training in sexual and reproductive health research to post-doctoral Adolescent Medicine physicians. While there have been some major success in utilizing effective interventions to address the high rates of sexual and reproductive health morbidity among adolescents and young adults (AYA), significant age- and racial-ethnic health disparities exist for youth in the United States. This is compounded by workforce shortages of individuals who are trained in Adolescent Health with specialized skills to use scientific evidence to ensure the healthy transition of youth into adulthood. Adolescent Medicine specialists, those who have contact with AYA in clinical settings, must also serve as leaders in the development and implementation of new prevention strategies to effectively prevent STIs, HIV, and unplanned pregnancy. This requires clinicians to critically understand the biopsychosocial development of adolescents and to build upon scientific advancements derived through collaboration with nurses, psychologists, epidemiologists, behavioral, social, and basic scientists, and statisticians. We have created an interactive training environment using an adult learning model that facilitates effective engagement of clinicians and scientists across pertinent fields to foster the development of our trainees. Over the history of the grant, we successfully recruited physician fellows into Adolescent Medicine fellowship and reproductive health research, of whom the majority were women and half were under-represented minorities. All of the fellows who have graduated were recruited into academic positions, key scientific leadership roles in government, and/or have initiated new agencies designed to improve the health of adolescents more broadly. Based on these successes, we now request an additional five years of funding to continue to support three fellows per year, one position for each of the three years of research training. The Adolescent Medicine program at Johns Hopkins University is uniquely qualified to develop and maintain such a program given the on-going research and quality of our faculty, the successful outcomes of our previous trainees, the resources available to foster research development, and the continuous influx of bright dedicated physicians committed to careers in Adolescent Medicine. Our program is also unique because of our emphasis on innovation at the intersection of sexual and reproductive health and the larger social ecology of adolescence to reduce the observed health disparities."
"9577833","PROJECT SUMMARY This project ?Diagnostics via Rapid Enrichment, Identification, and Phenotypic Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing of Pathogens from Blood,? submitted under RFA-AI-17-014 ?Partnerships for Development of Clinically Useful Diagnostics for Antimicrobial-Resistant Bacteria (R01)? will develop a rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic platform for the culture-independent identification and determination of antimicrobial susceptibility and/or resistance of bacterial pathogens. The indiscriminate use and misuse of antibiotics has led to an impending global health crisis: the development of widespread antibiotic resistance. Bloodstream infections (BSI) are particularly significant with respect to their clinical impact: Severe sepsis strikes more than one million Americans every year, and 15 to 30 percent of those people die. In the absence of a rapid and reliable antibiotic susceptibility test (AST), health care providers often resort to broad-spectrum antibiotics, further escalating the development of drug-resistant strains. Halting the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant organisms and providing appropriate life-saving therapy requires point-of-care (POC) diagnostics that can rapidly measure the drug susceptibility of a pathogen directly from clinical samples, eliminating the lengthy current procedures that require microbial growth. This project addresses a critical unmet need for rapid diagnostics that can both identify and determine the antimicrobial resistance profile of microbial pathogens. To address this problem, we propose to develop a combination of highly innovative technologies to (1) concentrate viable, low-abundance pathogens directly from blood without a culture step; (2) demonstrate the compatibility of the enrichment technology with the rapid and specific multiplexed detection of pathogens; (3) validate the compatibility of enrichment with an innovative, digital method of determining phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility; and (4) demonstrate that the entire workflow of pathogen concentration, identification, and phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility testing can be achieved in under 2 hours directly from human blood. This multidisciplinary project will be carried out by a highly experienced industrial research team with outstanding academic and clinical collaborators, and will create a new paradigm in diagnosis and treatment of bloodstream infections directly from clinical samples at the point- of-care. Countless lives will be saved and the spread of antibiotic resistance will be halted."
"9503071","ABSTRACT At any one time, tens of thousands of children are living with serious illness and they and their families endure a high degree of suffering. While national recommendations call for early palliative care (PC) integration for seriously ill children to ease suffering, very few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated whether PC improves child and family outcomes. In prior work, the investigators developed the Pediatric Quality of Life and Evaluation of Symptoms Technology (PediQUEST/PQ), a software that collects electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes (e-PROMS) and generates feedback reports. The effect of using PQ to provide feedback on child's symptoms and health related quality of life (HRQoL) to families and providers was tested in a three-site RCT, within the well established Pediatric PC Research Network, among 104 children ?2 years old with advanced cancer. The study demonstrated the feasibility of conducting a multisite RCT in this patient population, and an ability to obtain child self-report. Findings also included (a) high levels of child symptom distress, (b) association between higher symptom distress and worse HRQoL, (c) high parental psychological distress linked to child suffering, and (d) trends towards better HRQoL in the intervention arm. Subsequent formative research led to identification of barriers to improving symptom management including families and providers ?normalizing distress?, limited use of non-pharmacological treatment strategies, and limited early involvement of PC. Based on Wilson-Cleary's HRQoL model, and informed by these results, the PI and research team developed PQ Response (Response to Pediatric Oncology Symptom Experience). The intervention includes an enhanced PQ system (web-based), coupled with early integration of a PC consulting team (Response team). This dual strategy seeks to standardize the report of symptom distress using PQ feedback, and the providers' response to such distress, trained to include a series of steps in their assessment and interaction with the family including treatment and preventive strategies and family activation regarding symptom control. Pilot work for PQ Response found it feasible, well received by families and oncologists, and potentially effective. Thus, the over-riding aim of this study is to conduct a RCT of PQ Response versus usual care at four large pediatric oncology centers among children ?2 years old with advanced cancer (n=136). Hypotheses include a) children receiving the intervention will have better (higher) HRQoL scores b) parents of children in the intervention group will report better state-anxiety, depression and HRQoL and c) intervention group families will demonstrate higher levels of activation. Parents and children (if ?5 years old) in both arms will answer weekly PQ- Surveys for 16 weeks; parent anxiety, depression, and HRQoL will be assessed every 4-weeks; and parent activation every 8 weeks. Hypotheses will be tested using mixed effects models. The study will provide data on outcomes of early PC integration, use of e-PROMS and parent activation strategies in pediatrics, which are important knowledge gaps in palliative care research, and is well aligned with three key themes defined in NINR's strategic plan: science of symptoms, increased self-management, and palliative care."
"9626550","PROJECT SUMMARY Long-lived latently infected cells present a major obstacle to curing HIV infection; however, the upstream biochemical processes and signal transduction events that favor active HIV replication versus latent infection are poorly understood. We hypothesize that quality of signals at the time of infection is critical for establishing HIV latency. To investigate how signals contribute to productive or latent HIV infection we will use chimeric antigen receptors to modulate signaling at the time of infection. In addition, we will explore the cross talk between T cell receptor signaling cascades and those delivered across the virological synapse during cell-cell transmission of HIV. We are proposing the following three specific aims: 1) how does differential signaling influence HIV-1 infection of T cells; 2) identifying signaling events that are required for HIV infection; and 3) determine whether antigen receptor signal strength at the virological synapse influences HIV infection. In addition to the hypothesis, innovative aspects of this proposal include the interdisciplinary approach, which uses cellular, molecular and bioengineering tools to identify key regulatory networks that influence HIV infection. These studies will provide new insights into key regulatory networks that govern the establishment of HIV infection and latency. Furthermore, understanding the minimal requirements for T cell signaling and HIV infection will potentially identify novel cellular targets which could be manipulated in an effort to alter the size of the latent reservoir and the course of HIV/AIDS progression."
"9477054","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The normal structure and function of adult organs is maintained by resident stem cells and their progeny throughout life. The proliferation of adult stem cells and differentiation of their progeny must be tightly controlled. One of the best examples is the adult gastrointestinal epithelium which is constantly being renewed with the progeny of ISCs. ISCs replenish the intestinal epithelium every few days and represent a general model for tissue differentiation and stem cell properties. Deregulation of the regulatory mechanisms could result in the depletion of stem cells or in the excessive proliferation of stem cells/progenitor cells, eventually leading to diseases such as cancer. The long-term goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which adult ISC activities and homeostasis are regulated. We will use Drosophila adult midgut as a system. Over the past 7 years, studies in this system have demonstrated that the JAK/Stat, Dpp (Drosophila BMP), EGFR, and Hippo signaling pathways are required for midgut homeostasis under normal physiological conditions or in response to environmental challenges. However, currently it is unknown how these signaling pathways execute their signaling activities through their downstream target genes to control gut homeostasis. In our recent studies, we have demonstrated that BMP pathway, Hh signaling pathway, and HSPGs can regulate stem cell proliferation, differentiation, and stem cell-niche interactions in different manners, and play essential roles in regulating stem cell fate and homeostasis. Moreover, we have conducted ChIP- Seq experiments combined with RNAi-mediated screens to identify JAK/STAT downstream target genes. On the basis of our recent published studies and our unpublished data, we have proposed a number of important hypotheses aimed at elucidation of the molecular mechanisms regulating ISC activities and homeostasis. In this proposal, we will use Drosophila adult midgut as a system to address three independent, but highly related issues in the maintenance of gut homeostasis. First, we will examine mechanism(s) of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in regulating gut homeostasis. Second, we will define the mechanism(s) of Dpp signaling in regulating stem cell activity by mediating tracheal-gut interactions. Third, we will examine the mechanisms of Perlecan/ECM in the regulation of ISC-niche interactions. Taken together, integration of these three important regulatory mechanisms will enhance our understanding of the maintenance of homeostasis, signaling transduction, and stem cell regulation. The outcomes of this will shed light on human diseases associated with deregulation of ISC activities and gut homeostasis."
"9457150","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Real-time Optimized Biofeedback Utilizing Sport Techniques (ROBUST) represents an innovative new approach to reduce traumatic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Over the last four decades, these debilitating injuries have occurred at a 2 to 10-fold greater rate in female compared to male athletes with the highest prevalence occurring between the ages of 16-18 years. As a consequence, there is a large population of females that endure significant pain, functional limitations and knee osteoarthritis (OA) as early as 5 years after the initial unintentional injury. To reduce the burden of OA, The National Public Health Agenda for Osteoarthritis recommends both expanding and refining evidence-based prevention of ACL injury. There currently is a gap in knowledge regarding how to maximize the effectiveness of injury prevention training in young female athletes. The long-term goal is to reduce ACL injuries in young female athletes. The objective of this application is to increase the efficacy of biofeedback training to reduce the risk of ACL injury. This proposal tests the central hypothesis that biofeedback methodology is needed to maximize the effectiveness of neuromuscular prophylactic interventions. The rationale supporting this proposal is that once the proposed research is completed, health professionals will be more successful at preventing devastating ACL injuries through properly optimized and targeted biofeedback training for young at-risk females. Specific Aim 1 will identify the most optimal, focused approach for biofeedback in adolescent females at high risk for ACL injury. A six-week randomized, pre/post-testing design will be used to identify biofeedback training effects. Specific Aim 2 will determine the effects of hip strategy on retention of decreased knee abduction load with focused biofeedback. A six-month follow-up design will be used to test retention of real-time biofeedback intervention. This research is innovative because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by recognizing the need to optimize the application of biofeedback training. The work will contribute clinically relevant data in support of a future more robust clinical trial. The proposed research will be significant because it will lead to reduced rates of ACL injury in young females. Reduction of female injury rates to equal that of males would allow females annually to continue the health benefits of sports participation and avoid the long- term complications of osteoarthritis, which occurs with a 10 to 100-fold greater incidence in ACL-injured than in uninjured athletes."

"9456000","ABSTRACT  Growing evidence suggests that aberrant transcriptional regulation is a key component of the pathogenesis of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, which are thought to stem from an individual's inability to cope with stressful and traumatic events. Indeed, while traumatic events are very common, only susceptible individuals go on to develop psychopathologies, while others have the ability to cope and therefore remain resilient. Research into the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the pathological response to stress is crucial for the development of effective treatments to either mitigate susceptibility or enhance resilience.  The mechanisms underlying resilience to stress remain not fully understood. This project concerns the transcriptional repressor RE1-Silencing Transcription factor (REST), also known as neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF). REST is expressed in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a key brain site for the behavioral and endocrine responses of stress. Recent studies have suggested that REST may be a protective factor which would make neurons more resistant to stressors via the repression of downstream genes. Interestingly, we have found that REST levels are significantly elevated in the CeA of rats which are resilient to the effects of chronic social defeat stress (SDS). Several gaps still exist: i) Although REST is elevated in the amygdala of SDS resilient rats, whether the increased levels reflect increased binding of REST to target genes is unknown, as well as whether such binding alters gene expression in a region-specific manner. ii) Furthermore, it is unknown whether REST has a role in the development of behavioral vulnerability to chronic stress.  The provocative, high risk/high reward hypothesis of this application is that increased function of the REST transcriptional repressor in the CeA underlies the resilience to the adverse effects of chronic stress. This hypothesis will be tested by combining an established animal model with state-of-the-art molecular and epigenetic techniques to pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1 will determine whether elevated levels of REST in the CeA of SDS resilient rats reflect increased binding of REST to endogenous NRSE sites and the transcriptional repression of REST target genes in CeA neurons, by using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays followed by high density sequencing (ChIP-Seq), and RNA-seq. Aim 2 will determine whether CeA REST mediates resilience to chronic social defeat stress, by overexpressing REST in the CeA in vivo using an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector in SDS animals, and qPCR to validate REST-mediated repression of specific gene targets in the CeA that are stress responsive.  The proposed experiments lay the foundation for highly relevant studies to test the hypothesis that CeA REST is a substrate that confers resilience to stress-induced psychopathologies. This research may lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of the role of REST in the adult brain and of stress-related disorders."
"9483863","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of my laboratory is to define the molecular mechanisms by which accurate cell division occurs. Our efforts focus on the kinetochore, the central player in directing chromosome segregation. The kinetochore is a macromolecular structure that connects chromosomes to the microtubule polymers that power their movement. Our goal is to generate a coherent model for how the kinetochore functions as an integrated molecular machine. To direct faithful chromosome segregation, kinetochores must form two key interaction interfaces. First, kinetochores must associate with a single site on each chromosome to direct the assembly of a stable kinetochore structure. In vertebrates, this site is defined epigenetically by the presence of a specialized histone variant termed CENP-A, and through contributions of a 16-subunit Constitutive Centromere-Associated Network (CCAN). Together, these proteins form the interface with centromeric chromatin. Despite the identification of these molecules, it remains unclear how the CCAN is established and reorganized during the cell cycle, and also how these processes are modulated during different cell division programs, such as in the context of meiosis and early development. In addition, centromeres must have a specific open chromatin environment to facilitate proper kinetochore function, but the relationship between the CCAN and centromere chromatin is poorly defined. Second, kinetochores must form robust interactions with dynamic microtubule polymers and harness the force generated by depolymerizing microtubules to direct chromosome segregation. To understand this elegant interface, it is critical to define the individual contributions of key outer kinetochore microtubule-binding complexes and also assess their integrated activities. The kinetochore must also sense and correct microtubule attachments to ensure high fidelity chromosome segregation, requiring the functions from the spindle assembly checkpoint components. To understand these critical kinetochore activities and the functional requirements for chromosome segregation, it is also important to define the complete complement of human genes that are required for chromosome segregation. The advent of CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing has transformed the capability to conduct functional genetics experiments in human cells. This includes the ability to systematically screen gene targets for their loss of function phenotypes using cell biological assays and genome-wide functional genetics screening to analyze context-dependent essentiality to define synthetic lethality relationships. For the work in this proposal, our lab will investigate the fundamental mechanisms of chromosome segregation and kinetochore function, focusing on three related areas: 1) Specification and formation of the centromere- DNA interface, 2) Generation and regulation of dynamic kinetochore-microtubule interactions, 3) Functional genetic approaches to analyze chromosome segregation. We will analyze key open questions in these important areas using combined cell biological, biochemical, proteomic, and functional genetics approaches."
"9481718","The overarching goal of this TPPG is to elucidate common pathogenic mechanisms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and target these pathways with novel drug strategies. To that end, the initial TPPG funding period identified perturbations in several NO-based signaling pathways that contribute to PAH pathogenesis. Further, it identified and developed a number of promising candidate therapeutics. The current project focuses specifically on two candidate therapeutics - oral nitrite (NO2-) and nitro-oleic acid (NO2-OA) ? and their ability to modulate NO signaling to prevent PAH progression and heart failure. Crucial to the success of this project is the ability to specifically and accurately measure NO, its metabolites, and its protein/lipid signaling targets. To that end, the Bioanalytical Core brings together existing infrastructure and expertise to support investigators across all three projects in detecting and quantifying NO/reactive species that participate in seminal signaling events in biological samples and in vivo models. Specifically, the core is comprised of three critical components that will synergize to comprehensively detect and quantify all pertinent reactive nitrogen (NO, nitrite, nitrate, S-nitrosothiol, nitrated lipids) and reactive oxygen (superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, lipid radicals) species in both bench and bedside projects. 1) The chemiluminescence core will utilize reductive chemistry in conjunction with chemiluminescence NO detection to measure NO and its metabolites in biological specimens and assess bacterial nitrite/nitrate reductase activity in the microbiome. 2) The EPR component will utilize cutting edge EPR technology with spin trapping to directly measure radicals in biological samples. Additionally, EPR technology will enable the differentiation of endogenous and 15-N labeled NO species in biological samples. 3) The Mass Spectroscopy component will enable the measurement of NO and oxo-modified lipid and protein biomolecules. All three components of the Bioanalytical Core are already optimized for human and animal samples and are directed by experts in the respective technologies. Collectively, the services offered by the Bioanalytical Core will greatly expand and refine the ability of researchers in all three research projects of this TPPG to elucidate novel NO pathways and develop unique therapeutics that work mechanistically through the modulation of NO signaling."
"9437824","An emerging approach to treat patients with heart failure from non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) involves delivery of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that can that can improve CM performance in cell culture and in animal models, and are being tested in ongoing clinical trials. The functional benefits of MSC-therapy may involve a variety of mechanisms, but it remains unclear whether transplanted cells act primarily through direct cell-cell interactions, or through indirect paracrine signaling via soluble factors or via special microvesicles called exosomes that can transfer molecular cargo. Understanding MSC-enhanced CM function could lead to improved cardiotherapeutics, but progress has been hampered by the limits of existing models systems for understanding paracrine signaling in the cardiac niche environment.  Directly addressing an NHLBI topic of special interest (HL-142) on the role of exosomes as paracrine signal mediators in cardiovascular disease, this proposal aims to use 3D human engineered cardiac tissue (hECT) as a controllable biomimetic in vitro model of native human myocardium in order to identify the primary factors underlying MSC-mediated effects on cardiomyocyte contractile function. A novel multi-hECT bioreactor system with integrated force-sensing technology has generated preliminary data supporting a predominant effect of extrinsic paracrine signaling mechanisms, including bioactive secreted exosomes, that significantly exceed the benefits of direct coupling between MSCs and hCMs in human engineered cardiac tissues.  The governing hypothesis is that MSC treatment causes direct enhancement of cardiomyocyte contractile function primarily through paracrine signaling mechanisms involving secreted exosomes that can be identified, isolated, deconstructed and delivered as an alternative therapy for non-ischemic heart failure. Specific Aim 1 will resolve the environmental conditions that maximize MSC paracrine enhancement of hECT contractile performance, advancing our understanding of specific biophysical stimuli that modulate cardioactive signaling processes. Aim 2 will identify the role of exosomes and their molecular cargo in MSC-mediated contractile enhancement of hECTs by evaluating the potency of hMSC exosomes and cargo on hECT contractile function (Sub-aim 2a) and determining the molecular identity of lead inotropic compounds from hMSC exosome cargo (Sub-aim 2b). Finally, Aim 3 will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of delivered hMSC exosome-derived cardiotropic factors on recovery of contractility using in vitro (Sub-aim 3a) and in vivo (Sub-aim 3b) models of non-ischemic heart failure. By capturing the benefits of MSC therapy while circumventing the potential risks of live cell implantation, this proposal may lead to improved treatment options for patients who suffer heart failure from non-ischemic cardiomyopathy."
"9509637","ABSTRACT Antigen receptor genes are assembled from multiple gene segments during early lymphoid cell development in a process termed V(D)J rearrangement. During early B cell development in the bone marrow (BM), V(D)J and VJ joining occurs on the IgH and L chain genes, respectively and is mediated by the RAG recombinase in order to generate a diverse repertoire of antibodies. VH genes are dispersed through 2.5 Mb of the Igh locus, and thus compaction of the Igh locus serves to facilitate spatial proximity between the rearranged DHJH join and distal VH genes. Furthermore, V genes rearrange with very different intrinsic frequencies. The pioneering studies of mammalian chromosome structure using chromosome conformation capture (3C) methods have revealed that chromosomes are organized into a hierarchy of units that include topologically associating domains (TADs). Long range chromatin looping interactions within TADS link promoters (Pr) with enhancers (E) and regulate gene expression. However, little is known about the precise looping structure of the Igh locus that leads to locus contraction. We undertook an analysis of the entire Igh locus using chromosome conformation capture (3C) based methodology to systematically characterize three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization on several genomic scales. We found that the Igh locus is compartmentalized into two unique topological sub-domains separated by a relatively unstructured region. A set of extremely long range looping interactions that bridge the chromatin sub-domains and are pro-B cell-specific and Pax5-dependent. These looping interactions are anchored at Sites termed I, II, II.5 and III and which appear to be critical facilitators of Igh locus contraction. In new studies we identified the DNA motifs underpinning loop-anchor sites at Sites I and II. Our findings have led us to construct a model in which locus compaction may be mediated by specific VH promoter-novel enhancer interactions and CTCF looping. To fully appreciate the importance of these findings it would be very beneficial to visualize the Igh TAD as a 3D structure. This would enable us to directly probe the shape of the chromatin structure and determine the structure-function relationships between key chromatin elements and IgH repertoire. However, the study of TAD structure has been stymied by the lack of powerful modeling prediction tools to convert pairwise chromatin interactions discovered using 3C technologies into high resolution ensembles of 3D chromatin structures. We have addressed these issues as a collaborative team and have designed and implemented the novel Constrained-Self Avoiding Chromatin (C- SAC) chain algorithm that reconstructs large ensembles of 3D chromatin chains from 5C and HiC data sets. We propose to test our computational pipeline on new capture Hi-C data sets from the Igh locus and probe the relationship between specific chromatin loops, TAD structure and its impact on VH gene usage during V(D)J recombination. Our effort is not limited to the Ig loci, as our method would be generally applicable and permit a systematic interrogation of the biological underpinnings of TAD formation in mammalian genomes."

"9506276","ABSTRACT Cockroach allergen exposure elicits cockroach sensitization and poses an increased risk for asthma. However, there are no specific treatments or prophylactic approaches to target cockroach allergen-induced allergy and asthma. We have discovered an important link between C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and cockroach allergen- induced allergic sensitization and asthma. Dendritic cell immuno-receptor (DCIR) is a CLR expressed mainly in dendritic cells (DCs) that has a carbohydrate recognition domain in its extracellular portion and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic tail. DCIR is the only classical CLR with an ITIM that mediates either inhibitory or active signaling. Based on its structural characteristics, DCIR is critical in carbohydrate recognition and ITIM signaling cascades. However, the functional role of DCIR in antigen binding and downstream ITIM signaling-mediated immune responses is still poorly characterized. Recent studies suggest that DCIR is required to modulate lung inflammation and bacterial burden in tuberculosis. We have also demonstrated for the first time that DCIR is highly expressed in basophils and mediates cockroach allergen uptake. On the other hand, we have recently made intriguing findings that mast cells are increased in the lung tissues of cockroach allergen-induced mouse model of asthma and mast cell deficient mice (KitW-sh/W-sh) showed attenuated lung inflammation, highlighting the functional significance of mast cells in the development of asthma. This proposal focuses on mast cells and tests our novel hypothesis that DCIR recognizes cockroach allergen, modulates mast cell activation, and plays a critical role in mast cell-mediated allergic inflammation in allergic asthma. Indeed, we have found a significant binding of cockroach allergen to human DCIR, and cockroach allergen can promote DCIR expression in mast cells and induce mast cell activation with increased release of ?- hexosaminidase and IL-13. Importantly, there was an increased DCIR expression in lung tissue mast cells of mouse model of asthma. These exciting data set the stage to critically evaluate the functional significance of DCIR in the cockroach allergen-induced mast cell activation and mast cell-mediated allergic inflammation in allergic asthma. Aim 1 proposes experiments to determine the relationship between DCIR and asthma by detecting DCIR expression in human lung tissues and plasma of asthmatic patients and healthy subjects. Aim 2 proposes studies to understand the role of DCIR in cockroach allergen binding, uptake, and regulation of cockroach allergen-induced mast cell activation [e.g., degranulation, histamine release, cytokine production, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i ]. Aim 3 proposes experiments to define the role of DCIR in cockroach allergen-induced mouse model of asthma using Dcir-/- mice, or examine the role of DCIR specifically in mast cells in allergic asthma using mast cell deficient mice KitW-sh/W-sh reconstituted with mast cells from WT or Dcir-/- mice. This will lead to subsequent studies to probe the mechanisms underlying the allergen- induced and DCIR-mediated lung inflammation with DCIR as a potential therapeutic target for asthma."
"9342667","The rate of musculoskeletal injury differs substantially between men and women, with the incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries up to 9 times higher in female athletes. These injuries cause short- and long- term health problems, including time lost from school or work, psychological distress, and post-injury joint osteoarthritis. Sex hormones may make a significant contribution to this injury disparity: injury rate differences are not evident until puberty, and injuries occur disproportionately in the first half of the menstrual cycle. While most research has focused on passive components of the musculoskeletal system, arguing that female fluctuating hormone concentrations may change mechanical properties of the ligament itself, a direct link between ligament laxity and ACL injury has not been proven. The goal of this proposal is to test our central hypothesis that changes in sex hormone concentration result in changes to the basic elements of motor control ? at multiple levels, from the musculotendinous unit to motor control circuitry. In our preliminary data, at the muscle level, we have shown that the muscle reflex response is lowest when estradiol concentrations are highest, with no change in anterior knee laxity. At the spinal circuitry level, we have shown that while day-to-day changes in hormone concentration do not modulate spinal motor neuronal excitability, a lower overall level of excitability exists in women who take oral contraceptives. Finally, at the level of the brain, we have shown the excitability of intra-cortical interneuronal circuits is increased when estradiol concentrations are highest. In Aims 1 & 2 of our proposal, daily testing will allow, as never-before, a detailed assessment of the time-specific relationship between hormone concentration and changes at the muscle and spinal level during both relaxed and active states. In Aim 3, daily hormone concentrations will specifically determine each subject's testing day, guiding targeted assessments into the role of fluctuating hormone concentrations on cortical excitability. In Aim 1 we will determine the influence of sex hormone fluctuations on the muscle stretch reflex during active and passive states, and the time-lag between hormone concentration changes and the reflex response. We will use a technically simple assessment that could be implemented in the field. In Aim 2 we will determine the influence of sex hormone fluctuations on spinal motor neuron excitability using H-reflex as a probe and the simultaneous change in the muscle mechanics using muscle twitch response. Aims 1 & 2 will include a focus on the differential role of oral contraceptives. In Aim 3 we will use paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation during active contraction to determine the influence of sex hormone fluctuations on cortical excitability in naturally cycling women. Our findings have the potential to guide future research in injury prevention strategies, including targeted neuromuscular training. This knowledge will enable clinicians to educate female patients on neuromuscular effects of sex hormones during times of high fluctuations, including puberty, pregnancy, and menopause."
"9521760","Abstract As the 6th leading chronic disease in the U.S., allergies affect 30% of adults and 40% of children. Adverse drug reactions occur in 1 in 4 outpatients and 1 in 5 inpatients. Many allergies and adverse reactions warrant documentation in the electronic health record (EHR) allergy section to inform future medical care and prescribing. It is critical to obtain a complete and accurate allergy history for each patient and to provide clinicians with an efficient allergy-alerting clinical decision support (CDS) tool. However, the allergy modules in most existing EHRs have serious limitations in how allergies are documented and drug allergy alerts are fired. These include: frequently missing documentation of reaction mechanism and type, lack of a comprehensive terminology subset for encoding diverse reactions, insufficient tools for reconciling allergy information, and physician alert fatigue resulting from an alert override rate of greater than 90%. In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) improve reaction documentation by developing a comprehensive and interactive value set; 2) develop an innovative allergy reconciliation module within the EHR; 3) redesign drug allergy alerting mechanisms; and 4) distribute our methods and tools to healthcare institutions and the research community."
"9431944","Project Summary  Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells are a type of immune cell that is numerally small but immunologically important to our health. Numerous studies in humans and mice have suggested that if you do not have a normal population of iNKT cells, you have an increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases and cancers.  In the mouse, two genes with 95% sequence homology are encoding for the CD1d molecules. Recognition of lipid antigens presented by CD1d molecules is absolutely required for the development and functions of iNKT cells. Early findings argued that the second CD1d-encoding gene, CD1D2, does not play any role in iNKT cells biology. However, in complete departure from the current dogma, our preliminary data show that the CD1D2 gene is expressed in certain mouse strains. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the CD1d2 protein and our preliminary functional data, show that the antigen-binding groove of CD1d2 is restricted in size compared to CD1d1 and does not accommodate presentation of antigens with long acyl-chains. Although the lipid portions of antigens are buried in the CD1d groove, several reports have shown that the composition of the fatty acids, including the length, the degree of insaturation and the presence of other modifications, strongly influence antigenic potency.  The proposed studies aim at examining how CD1d1 molecules engineered to mimic antigen presentation of CD1d2 molecules affect the development of iNKT cells in vivo. These studies will open up substantial new possibilities for understanding iNKT cell development and effector programming so that it can be exploited for therapeutic usage to improve human health."
"9486909","Project Summary/Abstract Multimodular polyketide synthases (PKSs) catalyze the biosynthesis of many structurally and pharmacologically diverse antibiotics via an assembly line mechanism. Recently, genomic sequencing has revealed large numbers ? far surpassing known PKS biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) ? of cryptic or ?orphan? PKS BGCs associated with no known polyketide products. Therefore, the analysis of orphan PKSs should reveal intriguing novel biosynthetic strategies and new structures with new therapeutic properties as well as reveal paths to pathogenicity in microorganisms. In particular, the NOCAP (NOCardiosis-Associated Polyketide) synthase is an orphan PKS expressed in nine clinical strains of the Nocardia isolated from nocardiosis-affected patients. The NOCAP synthase has been partially reconstituted in vitro. However, because the remainder of the BGC encoding NOCAP and its set of tailoring enzymes was not reconstituted, this approach precludes identification and elucidation of the natural product(s). This proposed research training plan seeks to understand the biosynthetic repertoire of the NOCAP synthase, and also seeks to understand its role in the pathogenicity of Nocardia. Accordingly, the plan is divided into three specific aims: 1) direct cloning, refactoring and heterologous expression of the complete NOCAP BGC in the model expression host Streptomyces coelicolor for the efficient production, discovery and characterization of this synthase?s natural product(s), 2) deletion analysis of the tailoring enzymes accompanying the NOCAP synthase and characterization of their biosynthesis and transfer of different deoxysugars onto the aglycone, and 3) using co-cultures of wild-type and mutant Nocardia and human lung cell lines, investigation of how the NOCAP BGC natural product(s) provides a selective advantage during Nocardia infections. The recent surge in genomic sequencing has exposed many orphan PKSs and may provide a vast resource for pharmaceutical and agrochemical natural products research. Thus, this proposed research training plan represents an important next step: analysis of orphan PKSs and their roles in organism fitness. The results of the proposed study will contribute important tools and strategies for discovering and rationally engineering not only novel polyketides but also products derived from NRPSs. Further, the proposed plan will elucidate how these remarkable enzymes contributes to the biological fitness of microorganisms.  "
"9478297","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The racial and ethnic minority population in Texas surpassed the Anglo population in 2004, and is projected to increase substantially in the coming years. Projections for educational attainment for minorities, historically low because of socioeconomic and other factors, suggest continued disparity for college, graduate and professional school enrollment. Admission of minority students into doctoral study in the biomedical sciences in Texas, and indeed in the nation, remains low despite population changes in Texas, the second most populous in the country. Thus, there is a critical need to train a large number of health professionals to serve minority populations, not only in Texas but also at the national level. To address this critical need, we propose the Promoting Diversity in Research Training for Health Professionals (PDRT) program. University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) is a leader among the health science centers in Texas in training minority biomedical scientists. We have developed an integrated plan to increase the number of minorities in biomedical research, incorporating education at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral levels. The overall goal of PRDT is to provide underrepresented minority individuals, who are enrolled in a health professional program, a challenging and focused research experience in health disparities related to cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and sleep disorders.. The specific aims of the PRDT are: Aim 1. Generate a pool of applicants from the health professional programs at UNTHSC (Osteopathy, Pharmacy, Public Health and Physician Assistants) as well as regional health professional programs (UT-Southwestern Medical Center, Texas A&M College of Medicine, Texas Women's University), and recruit 15 participants each year for the PDRT program. Aim 2. Provide a 10-week research program that combines research in cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and sleep disorders, with a special emphasis on health disparities. Aim 3. Provide workshops in responsible conduct of research, experimental design, interprofessional education and health disparities. These aims will be accomplished by the following activities: (1) Recruitment, (2) Research Training and Education, (3) Training Scholar to improve their skills to succeed, (4) Evaluation and (5) Tracking. Our expectation is that continued focus on the aims in meeting our objective will directly impact eventual achievement of our goal of obtaining a diverse population comprised of underrepresented populations in health disparity research related to cardiovascular diseases.

"9513073","This is a fundamental basic research proposal that is focused on understanding the role of Bcl- 2-associated anthogene 3 (BAG3) in mediating selective autophagy and the turnover of tau in neurons and how these processes change during aging. Selective autophagy is part of a cell's protein quality control (PQC) system, which is the collection of cellular pathways that sense damaged proteins and facilitate their removal. PQC is essential for the maintenance of the appropriate, functional complement of proteins in a cell. Tau is a neuronally enriched multifunctional protein. Given the importance of tau in neuronal function, understanding the PQC processes which regulate phospho-tau species, as well as total tau levels, is of critical importance. There is a growing awareness that selective autophagy, i.e., the specific recognition and targeting of client proteins to the developing autophagosome is essential for effective PQC. Chaperones and co-chaperones, along with the autophagic machinery, are key PQC players in the process of recognizing and removing damaged proteins. The co-chaperone BAG3 is an important player in selective autophagy and thus a pivotal player in the PQC system. Recently we made the exciting discovery that in neurons BAG3 plays a significant role in facilitating autophagy and directing endogenous, soluble tau to autophagy. This is of fundamental importance because in healthy neurons autophagy is constitutively active and plays a significant role in maintaining a functional proteome. BAG3 is a stress-induced protein that increases during normal aging. It has been suggested that during aging the change in cellular demands increases the use of autophagy to maintain protein homeostasis, and that BAG3 plays an essential role in this process. Indeed, it has been documented that during aging BAG3 levels increase in the rodent brain concurrent with an increased dependence on autophagy for proteostasis. Therefore, understanding the role of BAG3 in autophagy and how it functions to facilitate the clearance of soluble tau species is of fundamental significance. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that BAG3 is a key mediator of selective autophagy in neurons and plays a significant role in mediating the clearance of tau. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To test the hypothesis that BAG3 modulates autophagy and tau turnover in situ and in vivo, and that during aging the dependence on BAG3 to facilitate autophagy and tau clearance increases, (2) To identify essential features of the BAG3- chaperone complex that mediate tau clearance, and (3) To characterize the mechanisms that regulate BAG3 expression and tests their role in autophagy-based clearance of tau in neurons. Currently little is known about the role of BAG3 in mediating autophagy in neurons, as well as how it facilitates the turnover of tau; this application addresses these gaps in our knowledge."
"9424946","The development of new methods to treat cancer is greatly needed. The Hsp90 protein folding machinery has been the target of significant interest for the development of anti-cancer agents. However, Hsp90 is responsible for the folding of ~300 protein folding substrates, which may lead to undesired on-target toxicity and may be responsible for many of the Hsp90-targeted drugs that have failed in clinical trials. Through a structure-based approach, an isoform-selective inhibitor of Hsp90 has been identified and shown to exhibit good selectivity and affinity against particular cancers. Consequently, the goal of this application is to optimize this new inhibitory scaffold for great affinity/efficacy, to evaluate the role of a specific Hsp90 isoform in cancer, and to validate this isoform as a target for the treatment of bladder cancer."
"9519339","Despite the wealth of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies supporting the dysconnectivity model of schizophrenia, our understanding of the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remains limited. Abnormalities in myelination are a plausible candidate as myelination is essential for the coordinated activity of neural networks that support cognitive function and behaviour. Moreover, myelin-related pathology has long been postulated in schizophrenia on the basis of post-mortem and gene expression evidence. Dys-myelination is also a key component of neurodevelopment theories of schizophrenia because myelination of cortical association areas in late adolescence and early adulthood coincides with the peak period of risk for disease onset. This application will harness the power of ultra-high-field MRI coupled with advanced analyses algorithms to detect and quantify cortical myelin in a way that has never been possible before and test the relevance of myelination for schizophrenia-related dysconnectivity. We provide initial evidence for intracortical myelin abnormalities in patients with recent onset schizophrenia and demonstrate their impact on connectivity and disease severity. In this application, we propose a series of experiments with three specific aims. First, we aim to demonstrate the reproducibility of our initial findings on schizophrenia-related intracortical myelin changes in an independent sample of patients with recent onset psychosis and relate these changes to the topological properties of the functional and structural connectome; we will also examine the functional correlates of compromised myelin integrity on clinical features and cognition (Aim 1). Second, we plan to test for longitudinal changes in myelination in patients with schizophrenia over a 2-year follow-up period and investigate their relevance to disease severity and course (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether abnormalities in myelination are related to familial risk of schizophrenia by investigating intracortical myelin and its effect on the functional and structural connectome and cognition in unaffected siblings of patients, both cross-sectionally and over a 2-year follow-up period (Aim 3). The inclusion of unaffected siblings will also allow for the investigation of myelin-related abnormalities relevant to schizophrenia without the confounding effect of medication. The results of this study will provide novel evidence for unlocking the mechanistic ?black box? in schizophrenia and will open new avenues for treatment using interventions that may target myelin pathology."
"9478332","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multi-parameter patient monitoring in intensive care units (ICU) remains unsatisfactory as evidenced by the well-known alarm fatigue problem. It has been reported that a critical care patient could generate 700 alarms per day. At UCSF, a daily average of 187 audible alarms per bed occurred in ICUs during one month of assessment. Improving signal processing algorithms, fine-tuning alarm thresholds, and downgrading some alarms to an inaudible category are some ways to address alarm fatigue. However, these interventions attempt to solve the problem within the context of conventional patient monitoring practice (i.e., the focus is on an individual alarm while ignoring the relationships among alarms, the contextual information established by other data available in electronic health record (EHR), and the sequential patterns of all of these variables). In fact, we argue that alarm fatigue reflecs a deeper challenge for critical care clinicians who are overloaded with increasingly available raw data but do not have appropriate tools to leverage the potential of these data to treat their patients. As a first step to support clinicians to overcome data overload, our goal is to precisely detect gross patient state changes by recognizing combinatorial and sequential patterns among individual alarms, physiological variables, and EHR data. Achieving this goal will lead to developing additional decision support tools to understand the causes and select potential interventions for the detected patient state changes.  Our group has done preliminary studies that demonstrate the feasibility of achieving this goal. In particular, we have evolved a specific algorithm to identify co-occurring monitor alarms, which frequently precede in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrests (CPA) but rarely occur among control patients, to a data fusion framework. This framework is capable of recognizing predictive combinations of a much richer set of variables including lab tests and additional physiological variables not available from monitors. We term these combinations SuperAlarm patterns. By construction, SuperAlarm triggers will occur much less frequently than monitor alarms, yet be more precise in detecting patient state changes. Thus, the objective of this application is to develop and validate further algorithm improvement under this SuperAlarm data fusion framework using prospective data. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To enrich SuperAlarm patterns by novel analysis of Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals; 2) To develop sequential pattern recognition methods for sequences of SuperAlarm triggers. 3) To conduct prospective data collection to develop and validate SuperAlarm model."
"9507672","Project Summary. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by retinal degeneration (RD), obesity, polydactyly, renal defects, and genital defects. This proposal focuses on one BBS-associated gene, Centrosomal protein of 290 kDa (CEP290), with the goal of understanding the role of CEP290 in the normal structure and function of the rod sensory cilium, and the mechanisms of pathophysiology in RD caused by CEP290 deficiency. CEP290 was chosen because depending on the allele and background, CEP290 defects cause an array of diverse defects, all involving RD. In contrast to most other BBS gene products, CEP290 protein does not form a stable part of the BBSome membrane coat complex, but it interacts functionally and physically with other BBS proteins. While CEP290 has been proposed to be a ciliary gate-keeper or a structural scaffold within the connecting cilium (CC), the field is currently divided on the localization and the structural and functional roles of CEP290 within the CC, and the mechanism for CEP290 regulation of ciliary trafficking is not well understood. The Specific Aims are: 1. Chronology of CEP290 (BBS14) Subcellular Localization and BBS Protein Localization in CEP290- or BBS4-Mediated Retinal Degeneration To test the hypothesis that CEP290 localizes peripherally to microtubule doublets and elucidate the structural role of CEP290, the superresolution imaging techniques, Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) and Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) will be used. To assess the hypothesis that mislocalization of interacting proteins such as BBS4 and BBS8,in CEP290-mediated RD is the direct result of the absence of CEP290, the localization of BBS4 over the course of RD will be tracked as well as CEP290 localization in BBS4-mediated RD. To correlate mislocalization with disease progression over time, histology, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and electroretinography (ERG) will be used. 2. Identification of the BBSome Interacting Domains of CEP290. BBS4 and BBS8 are BBSome subunits that both depend on the presence of CEP290 for proper localization. To test the hypotheses that CEP290 interacts with BBS4 and BBS8 through its N-terminal SMC homology domain, and that BBS4 and BBS8 interact with CEP290 through their tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) domains, the proposed domains, or full length proteins with and without mutations within the proposed interaction domains, will be expressed in hRPE1 cells and tests for both proper co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation will be performed. 3. Functional Rescue of Retinal Degeneration with In Vivo CEP290 domain Expression. To determine the in vivo role of CEP290 and its domains in protein mislocalization, CEP290 mutant mice will receive sub-retinal injections and electroporation of expression constructs for rescue domains and full-length CEP290 protein. Understanding the functions and disease mechanisms of CEP290 is essential for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of BBS and other retinal ciliopathies, and designing new therapies. "
"9486361","Summary Our project address fundamental problems of structures and mechanisms of protein molecules and their interaction networks. At the protein level, we will continue our NIGMS supported studies and focus on A) ?-Barrel Membrane Proteins (?MPs). We will develop models and computational tools for predicting their structure, understanding their mechanism, and formulating design of novel ?MPs. At the network level, we will explore a new research direction. We will B) develop models and exact algorithms by solving the discrete chemical master equation (dCME) to compute exact probability landscape and discrete probability flux of networks for studying stochastic control of cellular behavior. Furthermore, we will examine how phenotype switching arise in networks, starting from commonly occurring network motifs and comprehensively characterize the universe of their multistabilities. In Project A), we will focus on ?MPs found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, eukaryotic mitochondria, and in exotoxins. ?MPs are involved in fundamental processes such as transport, translocation, energy metabolism, and apoptosis induction. They are also important therapeutic targets against infectious diseases. In addition, there are significant engineering interests in developing ?MPs as bionanopores for single molecule detection and other biotech applications. Despite recent progress, our knowledge of ?MPs is limited: only a few dozens of structures of non-homologous ?MPs are known. Importantly, we lack general understanding of the organizing principles of ?MPs and their functioning mechanism. We propose to develop models and algorithms for A1) predicting structures of ?MPs, A2) deciphering the mechanism of gating in OmpG, and A3) designing novel ?MPs with desired geometry and stability towards broad biotech applications. Our approach will be based on the reduced state model we developed, the MHIP empirical potential function we obtained through extensive combinatorial analysis, the (m)DiSGro loop structure prediction and sampling algorithms, with significant new development. In Project B), we will focus on the fundamental problem of constructing exact stochastic probability landscape of networks of interacting molecules. Many important biological reactions involve only a small copy number of molecules. Stochasticity arising from such low copy events as well as rare events are important for fundamental processes such as embryonic development, stem cell differentiation and nongenetic heterogeneity. While the discrete chemical master equation (dCME) provides a generate framework for understanding stochasticity in mesocopic systems, many foundational problems remain. Despite significant progress, the exact time- evolving probability landscapes for many networks of interests are computationally inaccessible, except for a few simple toy problems (e.g. those with <4 nodes). One has to rely on Gillespie simulation or approximation of Langevin/Fokker-Planck formulations, with errors largely unexamined. We propose to develop B1) theoretical model and tools for computing probability fluxes on discrete state space at arbitrary microstate and for arbitrary reactions, so passageways, transient states, and critical paths important for characterizing phenotypical switches can be identified. We will also carried out computational analysis to decipher B2) common mechanisms of stochastic switching, as well as comprehensive mapping of phase diagrams of emerging multistabilities in the most widely encountered common biological motifs. Our approach will be based on our recent algorithm and theoretical development of multi-finite buffer network structure analysis, the corner simplex optimal state enumeration algorithm, and the ACME method for exact computation of time-evolving probability landscape, as well as error-bound analysis based our quotient matrix and the technique of stochastic ordering."
"9495790","Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers."
"9478272","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs), a generally asymptomatic process, develop as a consequence to abnormal remodeling of the aortic extracellular matrix (ECM) which weakens the aortic wall and leads to gross dilation that typically progresses to rupture. Currently, the treatment options consist of surgical reconstruction or endovascular intervention; neither of which addresses the underlying pathways which drive this devastating disease. TAAs are influenced by both intracellular and extracellular mechanisms that function to regulate matrix deposition and degradation, in part through the activation of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Previously, we identified membrane type-1 MMP (MT1-MMP) as a key mediator of TAA formation, through its role in both pericellular proteolysis and intracellular signaling. Utilizing murine model of TAA, protein levels of MT1-MMP increased during TAA development and localized to aortic fibroblasts. Moreover, MT1- MMP activity displayed a direct relationship with aortic dilatation. Importantly, when TAAs were induced in MT1-MMP heterozygous deficient mice, aortic dilatation was attenuated, suggesting it is required for TAA progression. Nevertheless, little is known in regards to the mechanisms that regulate the temporal expression, abundance, and activity of MT1-MMP during TAA development. MicroRNAs (miRs) have recently been identified as upstream mediators involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of protein production. We have demonstrated a loss in miR-133a expression, a validated miR that targets MT1-MMP translation, during TAA development. This loss of miR-133a displayed an inverse relationship with aortic size and coincided with an increase in MT1-MMP protein. Furthermore, several studies have suggested that MT1-MMP may be phosphorylated by protein kinase C and may play a role in regulating MT1-MMP activity through endocytosis. However, whether or not this phosphorylation may differentiate the multiple roles of MT1-MMP in regards to pericellular proteolysis and intracellular signaling remains to be defined. Accordingly, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that modulation of the dynamic regulation of MT1-MMP protein abundance, activity, and localization mediates TAA formation and progression, which will be examined with the following specific aims: (1) Demonstrate that MT1-MMP abundance and TAA development are regulated by changes in aortic fibroblast phenotype, mediated by changes in miR133a expression; (2) Demonstrate that pericellular proteolysis and intracellular signaling are mediated by changes in MT1- MMP cellular localization, regulated by phosphorylation of C-terminal residues. These studies will provide evidence for mechanistic changes that occur during TAA development, and will focus on both post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms that may reveal potential therapeutic targets."
"9544305","Project Summary/ Abstract Female surgical sterilization is the second most commonly used contraceptive method in the US and is disproportionately used by low-income women and women of color. Whether the higher use of sterilization in these populations reflects inappropriate overutilization is unclear. On one hand, low-income and racial minority women frequently misunderstand the permanent nature of sterilization, are often unaware of reversible contraceptive alternatives, and commonly experience regret after the procedure? suggesting suboptimal decision making. On the other hand, there is evidence of substantial unmet demand for sterilization among low-income women, due to unique access barriers posed by Medicaid sterilization regulations, putting them at high risk for unintended pregnancy and the adverse health and social consequences associated with unintended pregnancy. Medicaid sterilization policy currently requires that all women requesting a federally-funded procedure complete a standardized consent form at least 30 days prior to sterilization. This policy was originally instituted in the 1970s to protect vulnerable women from coercive sterilization practices by attempting to ensure informed and voluntary consent. However, there is growing consensus that the policy is incapable of ensuring informed consent, and that the mandatory 30-waiting period impedes access to desired sterilization for many low-income women. The lack of a process that can ensure both informed consent and timely access for sterilization procedures hampers progress toward reproductive health equity for low-income women. The proposed project seeks to build and test a novel, web-based decision support tool to optimize low-income women's ability to make informed and value-concordant decisions about surgical sterilization. A decision support tool may be particularly useful in the context of sterilization decisions because this is a preference- sensitive decision with permanent implications and because there is a high level of misunderstanding about sterilization and limited awareness of alternative options among women who have undergone the surgery, indicating critical gaps in the quality of pre-sterilization counseling. Furthermore, patient-provider interactions may be complicated by a broader social and historical context in which poor and minority women's reproductive choices have not always been valued. Thus, the specific aims of this proposal are to qualitatively determine low-income women's decision support needs and preferences as well as providers' perspectives on the role of decision support around surgical sterilization (Aim 1); build a patient-directed, web-based decision aid to support women's sterilization decision making (Aim 2); and conduct a 3-site, randomized controlled trial to test the effect of the decision aid plus usual care compared to usual care alone on decision quality among 350 racially-diverse, low-income women requesting post-partum sterilization (Aim 3)."

"9507852","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the data coordinating center's grant proposal for the Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial- Attention and Reading Trial (CITT-ART). The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will be housed in the College of Optometry at The Ohio State University. The CITT-ART is a multi-center randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the effects of treatment for symptomatic convergence insufficiency (Cl) on reading performance and attention in children. In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic convergence insufficiency will be randomly assigned to: 1) office-based vergence/ accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy with home reinforcement. After 16 weeks of treatment, examiners masked to treatment group assignment will administer the primary outcome measures for: 1) reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-III]) reading comprehension subtest and 2) attention (Strengths & Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]). The Gates MacGinitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Other secondary outcome measures include: a test of reading fluency (WIATT III), the SNAP test of attention, the CI Symptom Survey, clinical measures of CI (i.e., near point of convergence and positive fusional vergence at near), and assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading comprehension (pseudo word decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension). Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention will be assessed 1-year post treatment. This application provides the rationale for the design of the clinical trial ad a description of the goals and responsibilities of the DCC. This proposal also includes some results from previous studies performed by the core members of the CITT planning committee including personnel from the DCC.  Symptomatic CI is a common vision disorder in children that is commonly associated with symptoms while reading (e.g. loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading slowly, and trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of CI treatment on reading and attention is unknown. The results of the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and have important implications for educators, psychologists, and physicians who care for children with reading and attention problems. The findings will guide hypothesis development for future scientific investigations in children with vision disorders."

"9475092","PROJECT SUMMARY Callous-unemotional (CU) traits predict socially debilitating outcomes including Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) and violent crime in adulthood. Despite significant research, the etiology of CU traits is not well understood. The current project incorporates genetic, physiological, neuroanatomical and self-report measures to investigate the etiology of CU traits within the National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). Psychopathic/CU traits have long been proposed to reflect an underlying fear-deficit, and therefore this project focuses on measures corresponding with the acute fear construct within the RDoC matrix. Specifically, the physiological measures of facial eyeblink EMG in response to startle and fear-potentiated startle probes, as well as the neuroanatomical volumetric measures of regions of interest (ROIs; anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and amygdala) will be investigated as potential endophenotypes for CU traits. To be considered a putative endophenotype for CU traits a measure must display three characteristics: 1) association with CU traits, 2) heritability, and 3) genetic covariation with CU traits. While startle and neuroanatomy have been shown to meet the first two criteria, little to no research has investigated the third criteria. We hypothesize that startle response and neuroanatomical ROIs will meet all three criteria for endophenotypes of CU traits. Furthermore, we hypothesize that there are specific developmental periods that are most salient for the genetic and environmental factors influencing the progression of CU traits. We will address these hypotheses through the following Specific Aims: 1) investigate the phenotypic relationship between CU traits and startle, 2) examine the genetic influence on the variation and covariation of CU traits and startle throughout childhood and adolescence, and 3) investigate potential neuroanatomical ROIs associated with CU traits, and the genetic influence on the variation and covariation of ROIs and CU traits. We will accomplish these aims using a large, genetically informative, general population sample of juvenile (ages 9-20) twins (N=1696, 848 twin pairs). Biometrical structural equation modeling (i.e., `twin modeling') will be used to decompose the variance and covariance of CU traits and potential endophenotypes proposed here into latent factors reflecting the effects of 1) additive genetics, 2) unique environment and 3) dominant genetic or shared environment. Additionally, how these influences change over the important developmental period of childhood and adolescence also will be examined. This proposal directly corresponds with the NIMH strategic plan for research, which emphasizes the need for research on 1) defining the mechanisms associated with complex behaviors and 2) determining the developmental trajectories of mental illness. The results from this study have the potential to a) confirm the use of specific measures as endophenotypes in future research on CU traits, and b) inform future developmentally-based intervention strategies."
"9468447","Project Summary Parkinson?s disease (PD) is a progressive, debilitating neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure. While the cause of PD is unknown, oxidative stress, gliosis, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction and protein misfolding are all known to play a role in disease pathogenesis. Activation of the Nrf2 pathway is a promising therapeutic approach for PD. Unfortunately, Nrf2-based drugs have relied on electrophilic pharmacophores, which are not tolerated well in patients. A critical barrier to progress in developing more effective Nrf2-based therapies is the current lack of understanding of mechanisms that can safely activate this pathway. Bach1 is a transcription factor that represses Nrf2 gene expression. Our goal is to validate Bach1 inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy for PD pathogenesis, and to identify new target(s) for intervention. Our central hypothesis is that Bach1 inhibition is neuroprotective in PD due to both Nrf2-dependent and Nrf2-independent mechanisms. This hypothesis is based on the knowledge that genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of Bach1 in mice results in constitutive activation of neuroprotective Nrf2-dependent as well as Nrf2-independent genes, and protects against the parkinsonian neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Our objectives are to 1) determine the cell-specific roles of Bach1 in MPTP neurotoxicity in vivo, 2) delineate the role of Bach1 inhibition in mediating ?-synuclein-induced PD, 3) differentiate between Bach1- and Nrf2- dependent pathways in neuroprotection, and 4) identity novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Our expected outcomes include finding that 1) genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of Bach1 ameliorates ?-synucleinopathy and MPTP-neurotoxicity in mice; 2) Bach1-mediated neuroprotective mechanisms involve distinct cell types; 3) Bach1 inhibition or deletion protects Nrf2-null mice against MPTP- neurotoxicity; 4) Bach1-dependent mechanisms of neuroprotection involve upregulation of Nrf2-dependent as well as Nrf2-independent neuroprotective genes, whereas Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response element (ARE)-containing genes are critical for Nrf2-dependent mechanisms. Our studies will impact the field by: 1) improving understanding of Bach1 modulation of signaling pathways and downstream neuroprotective events relevant to pre-clinical models of PD; 2) validating a set of novel, non-electrophilic Bach1 inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for PD and synucleinopathies; and 3) identifying novel targets for therapeutic intervention. AIM 1: will test the hypothesis that genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of Bach1 protects against different modes of nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration. AIM 2: will test the hypothesis that Bach1 inhibition attenuates disease development in a mouse model of ?-synucleinopathy. AIM 3: will test the hypothesis that Bach1 inhibition confers neuroprotection via Nrf2-dependent and Nrf2-independent mechanisms."
"9481345","Project Summary/Abstract Individuals suffering from body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) experience peculiar misperceptions of their appearance, most often of the face or head. With convictions of disfigurement and ugliness, they typically have poor insight or even delusional beliefs, as well as obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, anxiety, and depression. These combine to result in significant difficulties in functioning, as well as depression, suicide attempts (25%), and psychiatric hospitalization (50%). Despite this severity, relatively few studies of the neurobiology, or even treatment studies, have been conducted in BDD. This underscores a critical need for research seeking to identify targets for intervention based on pathophysiological mechanisms. To-date, background research conducted by our group has provided early insights into neurobiological mechanisms that may contribute to these perceptual distortions, including prominent abnormalities in visual processing systems. These, along with evidence from neuropsychological and psychophysical tests of visuospatial and visual processing, have contributed to the development of a model of diminished global/holistic processing and enhanced detail processing, attributed to both ?top-down? and ?bottom-up? disturbances in perception. However, there remain gaps in the understanding of the neurobiology that may hinder the rational development of novel and effective treatment strategies. Studies thus far have primarily been cross-sectional and few have explored the effects of visual manipulation in order to probe for dynamic abnormalities. Accordingly, this study aims to illuminate the pathophysiology underlying perceptual distortions in BDD using two novel visual modulation techniques: a) attention modulation (?top-down?) and brief image presentation (?bottom-up?) to probe the visual system. We will enroll 34 individuals with BDD and 34 healthy controls, who will undergo two experiments involving viewing photographs of their face while being scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the attention modulation experiment, they will be given instructions and training to hold their gaze constant in order to increase fixation duration and decrease scanning of appearance details, which we hypothesize will increase dorsal visual stream (global/holistic processing) and decrease ventral visual stream (local/detail processing) activation in the brain. In the second experiment we will test whether brief face viewing time increases activity in dorsal visual areas. Results from this study will advance our understanding of the neurobiological basis of perceptual distortions in BDD and identify neurobiological treatment targets for future testing of novel, translational perceptual retraining treatments."
"9476252","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Small molecule drugs are the cornerstone of modern medical practice. However, their use is plagued by the onset of unexpected side effects, often seen only in late-stage clinical trials or after release to the market. As a result, there have bee a number of high profile drug withdrawals and a dearth of new drug development. Characterizing the combinatorial effects of drug treatment is of particular concern. It is very difficult to empirically study these interactions before drugs enter the market because of the small samples of co- prescribed drugs in most late stage clinical drug (Phase III) studies. Some interactions can be predicted based on knowledge of shared pathways of metabolism, but many are idiosyncratic and difficult to predict. Thus, we must create surveillance methods to detect unexpected drug effects and interactions that leverage the power of large-scale clinical databases such as the electronic health records. Mining of electronic health record data for the purpose of identifying adverse drug effects is an increasingly important research challenge. For example, in response to a congressional mandate the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established the mini-sentinel initiative in 2009 -- a pilot study that links claims and administratve data from over 31 institutions for the purpose of monitoring drug safety surveillance. In addition, public-private partnerships (e.g. the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) have sprouted to establish data management and analysis standards for safety surveillance. However, the potential of the EHR for drug surveillance is paralleled by an equal number of challenges. Many of these challenges are in the quality (or rather lack thereof) of data when used for secondary analyses. Data stored in the EHR are often dirty, noisy, and missing. In addition to issues regarding data capture, these data also suffer from bias which confounds analysis and makes data mining results difficult to interpret. These issues become especially acute in the context of combination therapies where the exposed patient cohorts are often small and suffer from unknown (i.e. unstudied) biases. In this proposal we present a drug safety surveillance strategy which integrates state-of-the-art signal detection algorithms with chemical systems biology data for the purpose of identifying unexpected effects of combination therapies. We present an integrative methodology which combines quantitative signal detection and chemical systems biology to mine drug effects from a large clinical database. This will require innovations in observational statistical data mining, network analysis, and integrative chemical systems biology. The result will be a set of tools for discovering drug effects and linking them to molecular interaction networks. These resources will aid federal regulators to better monitor the safety of drugs at the population level, pharmacologists who wish to understand the effects of drugs at the physiological level, and drug development researchers to explore new treatments of human disease."
"9553713","Project Summary: Hypertension, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease among US citizens and causes significant endo organ damage due to inflammation, and tissue injury. Exquisite autoregulatory control of renal vascular resistance is essential to protect against hyperbaric trauma and glomerular injury. Loss of autoregulatory control, as occurs in hypertension, increases glomerular capillary pressure and promotes renal injury. Hypertension activates inflammatory cascades that sustain the hypertensive state and accelerate renal injury progression. Anti-inflammatory treatment prevents autoregulatory impairment but a critical barrier to progress with hypertensive renal injury is identification of the inflammatory mechanisms involved. We now provide compelling new evidence identifying toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules as mechanistic links between inflammation and autoregulatory dysfunction. The studies proposed address the central hypothesis the TLR4 on renal microvascular cells and on resident MHC-II bearing cells is activated in hypertension, leading to afferent arteriole autoregulatory dysfunction and kidney injury. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that chronic TLR4 activation with low dose LPS treatment blunts afferent arteriole autoregulatory behavior. We will use the blood-perfused juxtamedullary nephron preparation to investigate the role of TLR4 signaling on autoregulatory function. Chronic administration of the TLR4 agonist, LPS, anti-TLR4 antibodies or TLR4 antagonists will reveal the role of TLR4 in intact renal microvessels of normotensive rats. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that AngII hypertension blunts autoregulatory behavior through mechanisms linked to TLR4 activation. Autoregulatory behavior will be assessed in vitro and in vivo in AngII-infused hypertensive rats with and without chronic administration of LPS, anti-TLR4 antibody or a TLR4 antagonist to establish the role of TLR4 in the renal microvascular dysfunction that occurs in AngII hypertension. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that TLR4-mediated loss of autoregulation in AngII hypertension is prevented by targeting MHC-II. A novel CLIP antagonist that ameliorates TLR4-mediated loss of autoregulation will test the efficacy of targeting MHC-II in AngII hypertension. Upon completion of these aims, we will have established that chronic TLR4 activation leads to a decline in renal microvascular autoregulatory capability and that this process is linked to MHC-II immune activation. We further expect that TLR4 activation underlies the renal autoregulatory dysfunction in AngII-induced hypertension through this MHC-II mechanism and contributes to hypertensive renal injury."
"9479140","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The gene products of the major forms of human polycystic kidney disease, polycystin-1, polycystin-2 and fibrocystin/polyductin all localize to th primary cilium. The primary cilium appears to be the major functional site for these proteins as mutations that affect ciliary structure also cause cystic disease. The mechanism by which membrane proteins like the polycystins and fibrocystin are trafficked to the cilium is largely unknown. Our long term goal is to understand how the cilium is assembled and how ciliary dysfunction leads to diseases like polycystic kidney disease. The hypothesis that drives our work is that the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system is critical for the assembly of both the cytoskeleton and the delivery of membrane proteins to the cilium. In particular, we focus our studies on the function of IFT20, which is localized to both the Golgi and ciliary compartments and is trafficked between the two organelles. IFT20 is absolutely required for ciliary assembly and its deletion from the kidney leads to severe polycystic kidney disease. This protein functions with a golgin protein GMAP210 in the delivery of polycystin-2 to cilia. It is likely that IFT20 functions in the context of membrane protein transport and a number of general trafficking proteins have been proposed to be involved in the movement of membrane proteins to cilia. In this proposal we seek to understand how the ciliary membrane proteins like the polycystins and fibrocystin are trafficked to the cilium. This will be carried by a combination of in vitro studiesof trafficking using a SNAP-tag based pulse-chase assay and in vivo studies of mutant mice."
"9590197","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory, the temporary storage of information for future manipulation to guide actions, is an essential component of nearly all cognitive processes. Deficits in working memory contribute to a variety of mental health disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Working memory is thought to be an emergent property of neurons acting in groups to form microcircuits. However, due in large part to technical limitations, working memory has been studied nearly exclusively at the scales of entire brain regions or individual neurons, both of which fail to reveal interactions in neuronal populations. A major challenge in understanding the neural mechanisms for working memory is to develop tools to measure, analyze, and model working memory at the scale of the neuronal microcircuit. In this application, we present approaches to solve this challenge using two-photon imaging of activity in neuronal populations in mice performing working memory tasks in virtual reality. We will combine our large imaging data sets with theoretical modeling approaches to develop new computational models of how working memory is generated in microcircuits. First, we will examine how working memory representations are encoded in neuronal populations by examining the stability of representations over long timescales, using chronic two- photon imaging of the same neurons over weeks during working memory behaviors. Second, we will perform imaging experiments during novel working memory tasks to test competing, long-standing theoretical models of working memory, including models based on attractor dynamics and sequence dynamics. Third, we will develop a new theoretical modeling framework in conjunction with rapid experiment-model iterations to generate and test new microcircuit-scale hypotheses for the neural mechanisms underlying working memory. Together the proposed work is expected to establish new approaches to measure, analyze, and model microcircuit function during working memory in the mouse, leading toward mechanistic studies of how working memory and its underlying microcircuits are disrupted in mental illness."
"9513601","Variability in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) clinical manifestation is primarily determined by modifier genes, which are poorly understood. Discovering of the genetic basis of differential vulnerability is critical in predictive and personalized care for patients with HCM and will enabling more comprehensive genetic and genomic screening with an aim to intervene as early as possible and eliminate risk of sudden death. The discovery of modifier genes that contribute to variation and incomplete penetrance of HCM has proven difficult in human cohorts. Large murine genetic reference populations (GRPs) now finally provide a effective solution. The BXD family of strains?currently the largest and best characterized mouse GRP?is made up of 160 highly diverse lines that descend from crosses between C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) parental strains. The BXDs have been bred specifically for systems genetics studies using both classic forward genetic methods and for reverse genetic studies. We have shown that the D2?father of the BXD cross?is an excellent murine HCM model. D2 contains mutations of Mybpc3 and Myh7, the major causal genes of HCM and the key features of human HCM. In contrast, the B6 (mother of the BXDs) has wild type alleles and normal hearts. The objective of our proposal is to identify modifier genes that affect the severity of HCM phenotypes. Our hypothesis is that interactions of modifier and causal genes govern HCM severity and related phenotypes. The research here involves multi-scale genetic, transcriptomic, molecular and cellular profiling of B6, D2, and up to 100 BXDs. This work will be transformative and lead to the identification of strong candidate genes and networks underlying individual differences in HCM phenotypes. Aim 1: Systematically quantify HCM-associated traits and their variability and heritability across 100 BXD genotypes of isogenic mice. The purpose of Aim 1 is to determine the clinical, laboratory and molecular HCM phenotypes in 100 BXD strains, setting the stage for us to explore genetic variation, cofactors, and mechanisms of HCM in Aims 2 and 3. Aim 2: Define genes that modulate the severity of HCM. Building upon the phenotype data generated in Aim 1, as well as the already acquired sequence and transcriptome data for B6 and D2, and BXDs, we will identify strong gene variants that modulate variability of HCM phenotypes using state-of-the-art system genetic strategies and conventional molecular and cellular assays. Aim 3: Test the translational validity of mouse HCM modifier gene candidates. We will justify candidate genes identified in Aim 2 with established HCM human GWAS data. In reciprocal reverse translation, we will evaluate candidate HCM genes from human cohorts and determine whether these variants are associated with HCM-associated traits in BXDs. Combining the top priority gene candidates from both mouse and human HCM studies, we will generate molecular and statistical models of susceptible candidate genes, linked phenotypes, and relevant mechanisms. We will finally validate genes modulating HCM phenotype severity using loss-off function strategy."
"9623747","PROJECT SUMMARY The opportunistic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans causes a meningoencephalitis that kills hundreds of thousands of people each year worldwide. The long-term goal of our research is to understand the pathogenesis of this devastating disease. This application focuses on a central aspect of cryptococcal infection, the interactions of this facultative intracellular pathogen with the phagocytic cells of its mammalian host. These interactions determine the outcome of infection, yet major gaps remain in our understanding of how they occur and influence downstream events. We propose a genome-wide strategy to discover C. neoformans factors that mediate or influence these interactions, and to explore a subset of them. In Aim 1 we propose to identify, on a whole-genome scale, mutations that cause altered fungal uptake by primary host cells. We will do this by using a powerful image-based assay to screen a newly available C. neoformans deletion collection. Deletion strains that show significant phenotypic alterations with both mouse and human primary cells will advance to Aim 2, in which we propose to test mutants in a mouse model of infection, construct strains to confirm and complement mutant phenotypes, and assess fungal fate within host cells. Together, these studies will yield a prioritized group of mutants that demonstrate aberrant interactions with both mouse and human phagocytes and also exhibit altered virulence in a mouse model. This information will serve as a springboard to future mechanistic studies in this critical area of fungal pathogenesis. Our strong relevant expertise makes it feasible to perform rigorous studies on a whole genome scale in the timeframe of an R21 application. Completing the proposed experiments will identify cryptococcal factors that influence crucial events of pathogenesis, either by directly mediating interactions with host cells or by indirectly influencing them. This exciting step forward in knowledge will position us and other investigators to pursue these factors mechanistically. It will likely lead to the discovery of novel factors that influence pathogenesis, open new directions for the study of C. neoformans and other microbial pathogens, and potentially suggest points of intervention to advance antifungal therapy and improve the outcome of a devastating disease."
"9671615","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 diabetes Mellitus is a devastating disease of epidemic proportions, which is threatening individual lives as well as sovereign economies worldwide. Defective function and death of insulin-producing pancreatic ß-cells is a hallmark of diabetes mellitus. In this proposal we aim to elucidate molecular mechanism(s) underlying ß-cell dysfunction and demise, which are mediated by a thus far unrecognized hormone released by the liver: kisspeptin1. In preliminary findings, we observe in mouse models which mimic human diabetes mellitus, the liver produces and releases into the circulation excessive amounts of kisspeptin1. Kisspeptin1 reaches the pancreatic ß-cells and acts through its receptor Kiss1R, which is located on ß-cells to inhibit cyclic AMP production. Reduction in ß-cell cyclic AMP levels has several potential consequences which are observed in humans with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 1) it reduces glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from ß-cells; 2) it reduces the response to incretin hormones in potentiating glucose simulated insulin secretion; 3) by reducing cyclic AMP levels, it renders ß-cells susceptible to programmed cell death (apoptosis) as a consequence of increased cellular stress (endoplasmic reticulum stress, unfolded protein response and oxidative stress). The proposed studies aim to further elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of our preliminary findings and to test whether the findings apply to humans with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The proposed studies are significant because they may lead to identification of molecular targets and therapeutic approaches for treating humans with diabetes mellitus and preventing or reversing ß-cell dysfunction and -death."

Program members investigate the roles of hematopoietic processes in health and disease, including the evolution of hematologic neoplasms from normal hematopoiesis and the roles of cellular immunity in cancer immune responses, especially toward developing new treatments for hematological malignancies. The program is organized around 3 scientific aims: (1) Discover novel molecular features of hematologic neoplasms to improve diagnosis, prognostication, and develop a new generation of rationally-targeted therapeutic approaches, (2) Interrogate mechanisms of tumor immune surveillance and evasion to develop and apply new anti-tumor cell- based immune therapies, and (3) Develop and administer an innovative portfolio of clinical trials based on rationally-targeted molecular, cellular and immune cancer therapeutics. These aims reflect major working groups and initiatives that coalesces program members with other Cancer Center investigators through inter- programmatic collaborations that result in preclinical and clinical research efforts, grants, and trial protocols.

"9539701","Project Summary  While mucus barriers provide natural protection from pathogens and allow for passage of nutrients, loss of homeostasis in diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) results in abnormal mucus secretions with dysfunctional clearance mechanisms. As a result, most morbidity and mortality in CF patients from advanced lung disease is in part due to the altered mucus microenvironment. In CF, the local mucus environment not only promotes the development of chronic bacterial infections, but it is hyperconcentrated and viscous, preventing effective penetration of therapeutics through the barrier to correct the affected epithelia or infections. To improve delivery and efficacy of therapeutics, it is critical to enhance therapeutic penetration through the mucus barrier. Current strategies have focused on hydrophilic, net-neutral charge polymers to improve transport and minimize interactions with mucus. However, current technology may be immunogenic after repeated dosing and may demonstrate suboptimal cellular uptake. Also, it is unclear if current technology achieves maximum transport, and studies have been limited to a small number of testable formulations with uniform surface chemistries, which may not be optimal interfaces for mucus penetration. Using bacterial viruses, i.e. bacteriophage, we have identified phage-presenting peptides from a large combination of random peptides (107-109) that are mucus-inert and facilitate transport through the mucus barrier.  From this finding, the objective of this proposal is to develop chitosan nanoparticles that mimic mucus- penetrating bacteriophage and deliver CRISPR/Cas9 targeting defective CFTR mutations to treat cell culture and animal models of cystic fibrosis. We hypothesize that our chitosan nanoparticles will achieve effective complexation of CRISPR/Cas9 nucleic acids, and functionalization of these nanoparticles with mucus-inert peptides will successfully overcome the mucus barrier for effective gene delivery into the diseased epithelia. We further propose that the composition and distribution of penetrating peptides will change transport behavior in mucus. To test these hypotheses, the specific aims of this work will focus on the following: (1) develop chitosan CRISPR/Cas9 complexes coated with mucus penetrating peptides; (2) validate rapid transport of these nanoparticles by particle tracking microscopy and perform mutagenesis studies to dissect the amino acids responsible for facilitating mucus penetration; and (3) confirm delivery and gene correction of defective CF bronchial epithelium cell lines and animal model of CF. The proposed work is innovative because by mimicking mucus-penetrating bacteriophage, we will have developed a new class of synthetic chitosan nanoparticles capable of targeted genomic editing for therapy. The significance of the proposed work is bacterial viruses provided the inspiration for design of new gene targeting delivery systems, and from this work, we can begin to understand physicochemical properties impacts transport, and thus, will provide comprehensive design principles to develop more effective gene and drug delivery through mucus barriers.     "
"9481721","Cell signaling actions mediated by reduction-oxidation (redox)-dependent post-translational modifications include oxidation, glutathionylation, S-nitrosation, and alkylation reactions. These reactions intimately link metabolic and inflammatory status with changes in cell and organ function, since many enzymes, receptors and transcriptional regulatory proteins mediating metabolic and inflammatory responses contain functionally- significant hyperreactive Cys moieties. We now know that nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) are metabolized by commensal bacteria, metalloproteins, and digestive processes, yielding nitric oxide (NO) and secondary nitrogen oxides that elicit unique redox signaling responses via nitrosation, nitration and oxidation reactions. The nature and amounts of various nitrogen oxides are dependent on inflammatory status, diet, acidic microenvironments and NO3--reducing enterosalivary bacterial populations. Many of these products are chemically reactive and generate protein NO-heme complexes, protein Cys-NO adducts (RSNO), and electrophilic fatty acid nitroalkenes (NO2-FA) that readily and reversibly alkylate susceptible protein thiols. The cGMP-independent pleiotropic signaling actions of NO2-FAs induce adaptive tissue responses that include beneficial shifts in adipokine and cytokine expression, restoration of insulin sensitivity and the attenuation of right ventricular end systolic pressure (RVESP). This motivated us to hypothesize that the promotion of nitro- fatty acid signaling alleviates metabolic syndrome-induced hypertension and its pulmonary complications. To test this concept, a de-risked new drug strategy is evaluated by pursuing two mechanistically-revealing model system and clinically-based specific aims: 1. Define the molecular targets, biochemical responses and physiological actions of a) the dietary NO2-FA precursors (NO2-, NO3-, conjugated linoleic acid) and b) pure NO2-FA in rodent models of obesity-induced pulmonary hypertension. 2. Evaluate the clinical responses of Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension patients to the orally administered NO2-FA, 10-nitro-octadec-9-enoic acid (NO2-OA). Preliminary studies reveal that NO2-FA-mediated PTMs will promote salutary responses, as NO2-FA have already undergone extensive preclinical toxicology and pharmacokinetics evaluation and are in FDA-approved Phase 1 testing of both IV and oral formulations in humans. The pulmonary vascular responses to NO2-FA are anticipated to be more efficacious than many single-target drugs, because of the pleiotropic signaling actions of NO2-FA."
"9478533","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The global objective of this research is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying tissue homeostasis and regeneration in mammalian skin and to understand how this process goes awry in human disorders, including cancers. Central to achieving this goal is the purification and characterization of the different stem cell (SC) populations within skin and determination of their relative contributions to tissue homeostasis and wound- repair. Past AR050452 research led to purification of hair follicle (HF) bulge cells, and established them as self- renewing SCs that function in hair cycling and wound-repair. These HF-SCs also displayed more robust self- renewing and broader tissue regenerative potential than interfollicular epidermal (IFE)-SCs. Several differences might account for this. One is that like human IFE-SCs, mouse HF-SCs exist in a quiescent state for prolonged periods. Another is that they uniquely express transcription factors such as Nfatc1, which when absent, causes HF-SCs to lose quiescence and cycle HFs continuously. Past AR050452 research has set the foundations to tackle the following key questions: (1). Is HF-SC quiescence critical to their long-term maintenance? What happens when HFs cycle continuously? Do they expend their SCs over time? Can they heal wounds faster? (2) What are the molecular mechanisms governing the resting phase of the HF-SC niche? How do Nfatc1 and its associated transcriptional regulators function to maintain HF-SC quiescence? What are its direct targets and how do they regulate the balance between quiescence and long-term self-renewal? (3) What molecular changes define the difference between stemness and the transit amplifying state? Do stem cell progeny influence this transition and if so how? (4) What are the relative contributions of IFE and HF SCs to wound-repair? Does this differ in superficial vs deep wounds? In young vs adult mice. (5) How do IFE and HF SCs alter gene expression in response to injury? How fast these changes and what are controls the process? To answer these questions, we'll use FACS, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, conditional gene knockout and RNAi screens in vivo and employ these methods to explore skin stem cells in their native, mutant and wound-induced environments."
"9458587","Project Summary/Abstract  Latino adolescents in the United States face a number of mental health disparities. In particular, this group appears to experience an excessive disease burden due to social anxiety. In line with National Institute of Mental Health research initiatives, the present study seeks to examine how cultural factors relevant to Latinos are related to neural correlates thought to be associated with clinical dimensions of social anxiety, in an effort to inform the design of tailored prevention and intervention efforts aimed at mitigating mental health inequalities. Specifically, the present study plans to investigate the association of collectivism (an attitudinal cultural value in which group cohesion and interpersonal relationships are given great value and priority) and two event-related brain potential (ERP) components, the error-related negativity (ERN) and the feedback negativity (FN). The ERN and FN are negative deflections in the ERP that occur following error detection and receipt of feedback. Extensive literature links them to cognitive processes (exaggerated error-monitoring and feedback response) that contribute to social anxiety symptomatology. These electrophysiological measures have also been conceptualized as reflections of individual variance in threat sensitivity. Specifically, the meaning of a certain context to an individual can enhance the neural response to errors or feedback. In line with this understanding, for individuals who endorse adherence to collectivism, the social context is thought to have especially high importance. Thus, errors and negative feedback that take place in a social context are more salient, which is manifested in enhanced ERN and FN. We aim to test three manipulations of social context in samples of Latino (n = 37) and non-Latino Caucasian (n = 37) adolescents using electrophysiological research methods (ERPs). Each task will include an ecologically valid manipulation of social environment that reflects facets of the cultural and developmental group under study. The three experimental tasks are complementary in their ability to address the notion that culture interacts with neural mechanisms associated with cognitive processes that contribute to social anxiety symptoms. Consistent with a cultural neuroscience perspective, this research intends to explore how an individual?s view of themselves and their connections to others play a critical role in determining the implicit meaning and value of the social context and of one?s neural response to social stimuli. Findings may have translational implications and inform the science that guides the development of culturally appropriate anxiety treatment for underserved youth. The long-term goal of this project is to provide the applicant with training that will set the stage for a career in the field of pediatric cultural clinical neuroscience. Thus, the proposed fellowship is designed to promote acquisition of new knowledge and skills related to psychophysiological research methods, as well as to integrate training in cultural and developmental frameworks."
"9429204","Project Summary/Abstract Approximately half of patients with malignant melanoma and papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) have a tumor that harbors a BRAFV600 mutation. Mutation detection is the critical branch-point in determining whether BRAF-targeted therapy is an option for patients with advanced (unresectable Stage III and IV) melanoma. Also, knowing a PTC patient's BRAF status may be clinically actionable, since it may guide the extent of initial surgery (lobectomy versus total thyroidectomy and consideration of central lymphadenectomy), the approach to surveillance imaging (radioactive iodine scan versus PET-CT), and adjuvant therapy. Currently, commercial BRAF mutational analysis assays are limited by sensitivity and lack robust clinical validation in large numbers of patients treated with a BRAF inhibitor or following tumor resection in the high-risk setting. With BRAF targeted therapy now established as a standard therapy for patients with BRAF mutant malignancies, we feel that the development of highly-sensitive, blood-based assays have the potential to greatly improve the care of patients. We have formerly described testing with a highly sensitive assay that has the ability to detect BRAFV600 mutations in the blood of patients with BRAF mutant melanoma, and now have shown that this assay has excellent sensitivity and specificity vis-à-vis tissue based analysis in both melanoma and PTC patients. In this proposal, we aim to optimize our assay in the research laboratory at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where all the previous work with the assay has been performed, during the UH2 portion of the grant and harmonize the assay in a CLIA-approved laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Once the assay has been optimized, harmonized and successfully transferred to the CLIA- approved laboratory at MGH, we plan to clinically validate our assay in patients with Stage III and Stage IV melanoma and resectable and metastatic PTC through the analysis of samples obtained from several different clinical trials. These include a neoadjuvant trial of dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with Stage III BRAF-mutant melanoma (NCT02231775), a randomized Phase III study of the sequence of dabrafenib plus trametinib followed by ipilimumab plus nivolumab compared with the other sequence in treatment naïve patients with advanced melanoma (NCT02224781), a Phase III randomized double blind study comparing the complete remission rate following a 4-week course of the MEK inhibitor, selumetinib, or placebo and a single dose adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy in patients  two phase II targeted therapies, one with the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor lenvatinib (NCT02657369) and the other with the mTOR inhibitor MLN0128 (NCT02244463). with differentiated thyroid cancer (NCT02393690), and"

"9514974","Naturally occurring mutations in two separate genes, PKD1 and PKD2, are responsible for the vast majority (~99%) of all cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), one of the most common genetic diseases affecting 1 in 1000 Americans. The hallmark of ADPKD is the development of epithelial cysts in the kidney, liver, and pancreas. Currently, there is no effective treatment for ADPKD. PKD1 encodes a large plasma membrane protein (PKD1 or Polycystin 1) with a long extracellular domain and has been speculated that it can function as an atypical G protein coupled receptor. PKD2 encodes an ion channel of the Transient Receptor Potential superfamily (TRPP2, PKD2, or Polycystin 2). However, the molecular function of these proteins and the mechanism(s) by which mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 cause ADPKD have been elusive. We have shown recently that PKD1 and TRPP2 form a complex at the plasma membrane that is activated by secreted WNT ligands. WNT proteins bind directly to the extracellular domain of PKD1 and induce Ca2+ influx and whole cell currents that are dependent on TRPP2. The PKD1/TRPP2 complex contains Dishevelleds (DVLs), which are cytoplasmic proteins that mediate Wnt signaling. The PKD1/TRPP2 complex has an essential role in directed cell migration and chemotaxis in response to a WNT ligand. In frog embryos pkd1 works together with wnt9a and dvl2 to control kidney tubular diameter. Therefore, we hypothesize that PKD1 and TRPP2 mediate WNT-induced Ca2+ signaling that is essential for directed cell migration and contributes to the determination of kidney tubule diameter. In this proposal, we will determine the mechanism of WNT- induced activation of PKD1/TRPP2 (Specific Aim 1). Determine the step(s) in WNT-induced directed cell migration specifically affected by PKD1 and TRPP2 (Specific Aim 2). Determine whether DVLs alone or in association with other cytosolic proteins linked to Wnt signaling function downstream of PKD1 and TRPP2 in WNT-induced cell migration (Specific Aim 3). This proposal is expected to shed light onto the mechanisms of WNT-induced activation of the PKD1/TRPP2, the mechanisms by which these proteins regulate directed cell migration, and cellular pathways activated immediately downstream of WNT-induced PKD1/TRPP2-mediated Ca2+ signaling. Knowledge of these pathways can be used as the springboard for the discovery of new druggable targets for ADPKD."
"9478541","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: Dr. Sparks is an Instructor of Medicine in the Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS), Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) where he has 88% of his full-time professional effort committed to his research projects. He has 12% of his time devoted to clinical care at BWH and teaching at Harvard Medical School (HMS). He has received a Master of Medical Sciences degree in patient-oriented research from HMS, and a career development award from the Rheumatology Research Foundation. His dedication to clinical investigation is evident by 9 total and 6 first-author original research publications, presentations at national and international scientific meetings, and service on scientific committees. He has an experienced team of senior mentors and strong institutional support in an environment that fosters training in patient-oriented research. In line with his career development plan for this award, his immediate career goals are to expand his prior findings on increased risk of respiratory mortality for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using two prospective cohorts that will serve as the foundation for future independent research endeavors linking RA pathogenesis with subsequent respiratory outcomes. With the assistance of his expert mentoring team, led by Dr. Elizabeth Karlson, he will obtain training in advanced statistical methods in outcomes research, pulmonary evaluation and phenotyping, and integration of biomarkers in his studies to complete the aims of this proposal. The research training, mentorship, and results that arise from this project will lay the groundwork so that he can achieve his long-term goal to become an independent scientist in the field of RA epidemiology. Ultimately, he plans to develop interventions that prevent or decrease the respiratory burden of RA patients while informing the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases. Environment: Dr. Sparks has a commitment from his Department and Division at BWH that ensures at least 75% protected time for the research and career development activities detailed in this K23 proposal. He has institutional support from a recruitment package as well as supplemental salary support though his primary mentor's funding. He has access to subjects with RA for recruitment in the Brigham RA Sequential Study (BRASS), an ongoing 13-year longitudinal cohort, as well as >2,500 RA patients seen annually at the BWH Arthritis Center. Since BWH is a leading academic hospital for rheumatic and pulmonary diseases, he will have access to recruit adequate numbers of subjects for this project and future studies. He will obtain training in pulmonary phenotyping at the BWH Pulmonary Physiology Center and RA/Interstitial Lung Disease Clinic. In addition, he has full access to data in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), through the BWH Channing Division of Network Medicine. The NHS is composed of 121,700 women followed since 1976 with data on RA, respiratory outcomes, and covariates such as smoking. He has access to data on biomarkers from banked samples in a subset of women in the NHS who later developed RA. He has full access to data already collected and biospecimens in BRASS through the Division and SCS at BWH. Translational and patient-oriented research expertise is available at HMS, the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center, and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. At the latter, he will take courses in causal inference, programming, biomarkers, and longitudinal analysis to acquire skills for this proposal. Dr. Sparks will have access to the larger BWH and Harvard research communities for presentations and feedback. In addition to protected time and financial support, Dr. Sparks has an office, computer with word processing and statistical software, telephone, copy/fax machine, and administrative support provided by the Division and SCS that will be extended during this award. Research: The overall hypothesis of this project is that inflammation and autoimmunity contribute to the respiratory burden of RA. This hypothesis is based on prior data demonstrating increased respiratory mortality among women with seropositive RA independent of smoking. In addition, preliminary data suggest that serum inflammatory markers and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies are associated with increased respiratory burden among patients with RA. In this K23 proposal, Dr. Sparks will build upon these findings using two prospective cohorts, the NHS and BRASS. He will utilize the strengths of both cohorts to examine complementary hypotheses. The NHS is comprised of detailed and lengthy data on a large cohort of women in the United States. Follow-up data before and after RA diagnosis in the NHS are available for examining how pre-RA factors affect outcomes occurring after RA diagnosis. BRASS has detailed data on clinical and RA-specific measures including disease activity, medications, and functional status in a large cohort of RA patients. First, this proposal will determine whether women with RA in the NHS are at increased risk for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and respiratory mortality. Second, this proposal will examine whether inflammatory biomarkers are associated with dyspnea and pulmonary comorbidities in BRASS. In this aim, the candidate will recruit subjects to prospectively receive additional respiratory measures. Finally, this proposal will examine whether anti-citrullinated protein antibodies are associated with respiratory outcomes when measured in the pre-clinical RA phase and patients with RA. By investigating the roles of inflammation and autoimmunity in respiratory outcomes in RA, Dr. Sparks will obtain training in statistical analysis, recruitment, pulmonary phenotyping, and biomarkers that position him to become a leader in clinical investigation."

"9444379","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background. Over half of Veterans report musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, often with mental health comorbidities. Complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies are important non-pharmacologic treatment options for these conditions. However, CIH is not widely available at the VA. Also, practitioner-delivered therapies (i.e., acupuncture or chiropractic) are promising, but providers would like patients to be more active in their pain management by using self-care (i.e., meditation, tai chi, yoga) instead of relying on practitioner-delivered care. A critical question for the field is whether adding self-care CIH to practitioner-delivered CIH is a more effective approach than either strategy alone. However, we are unaware of anyone examining this. Also, to-date, studying CIH in large VA samples has been difficult because few facilities capture CIH use with codes in their electronic health records, and very few use the VA's standardized codes, preventing multi-site studies. In 2016, Congress passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act mandating expansion of CIH therapies in VA. In response, 18 VA regional networks committed $5 million/yr to implement CIH therapies at 18 sites beginning in 2018, focusing on five evidence-based therapies: acupuncture, chiropractic, Tai Chi, mindfulness, and yoga. The VA's Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation (OPCC&CT) will oversee this effort, including the data collection efforts targeting 1,000 CIH users from each of the 18 sites. We propose addressing the above gaps by continue our longstanding collaboration with OPCC&CT to capitalize on 1) the 2018 rollout of CIH in 18 VA sites and 2) our two current national/multisite studies of the effects of CIH, one on MSK pain and the other which integrates CIH patient reported outcomes (PROs) measurement into clinical care. We propose a large-scale pragmatic comparative effectiveness clinical trial to assess CIH. In the UG3 Planning Phase, as the 18 sites begin implementing CIH, we will develop and implement data collection instruments and processes that we are currently piloting to capture CIH use and PROs: 1) pain and its intensity and interference, 2) global physical and mental health and 3) fatigue. We also will examine opioid use. To inform that measurement, we will use multiple strategies, including an Advisory Board. In the UH3 Implementation Phase, we will conduct a 3-arm pragmatic trial using an encouragement design to assess the longitudinal comparative effectiveness of: 1) practitioner-delivered care (acupuncture or chiropractic care) combined with self-care (Tai Chi, meditation/mindfulness or yoga) compared to 2) practitioner-delivered care alone or 3) self-care alone. We will examine outcomes at 3 and 6 months for OPCC&CT's target sample of 18,000 CIH users. We will use randomized ?nudges? (e.g., educational brochures with class listings) tailored to each site to encourage Veterans who use one type of CIH to consider a combination of therapies."

"9598506","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite decades of research, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) remains a major threat in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), as the second leading cause of bloodstream infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and surgical site infections. Rates of invasive S. aureus infection in neonates far exceed rates of infection in older children and adults. Novel strategies are needed to prevent S. aureus disease in this population. Some neonates that are exposed to S. aureus become colonized, whereas others do not become colonized. Prior, mostly cross-sectional, studies have suggested that cultured commensal skin bacteria, including coagulase- negative Staphylococci and Corynebacterium spp. may compete with and exclude S. aureus from the nasal microbiota. 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing techniques can provide a better understanding of the nasal microbiota, including the interactions and functional characteristics of bacterial communities, to inform new strategies for the prevention of neonatal S. aureus colonization and disease. For example, a single species may not be sufficient to resist S. aureus colonization, but a community of organisms may exist that protects against colonization. Our long-term goal is to further understand the nasal microbiota and develop novel interventions for prevention of neonatal S. aureus infections. We propose to characterize the dynamic nasal microbiota of neonates in the NICU using 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing techniques using stored specimens from a federally-funded randomized controlled trial. The Specific Aim is to characterize the dynamic nasal microbiota in our existing cohort of hospitalized neonates at risk for S. aureus colonization and to identify bacterial communities that may provide resistance to S. aureus colonization, and the Sub Aim is to identify clinical characteristics, such as antibiotic exposure and parental S. aureus colonization status, which may impact the dynamic nasal microbiota and reduce resistance to S. aureus colonization. A matched case- control study will be conducted using clinical data and stored weekly nasal swabs from 50 hospitalized neonates who acquired S. aureus and 100 hospitalized neonates who did not acquire S. aureus colonization. By combining 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing techniques with our unique patient cohort and stored samples, we will characterize the nasal microbiota and offer insights into how bacterial communities interact to promote colonization resistance against S. aureus. This proposal builds on our previous work to develop novel strategies to prevent S. aureus disease in vulnerable neonates. The proposed work will lay the foundation for targeted microbiome studies as a potential preventive strategy in a high-risk, minority, population."

Specifically, lower level of participation in shared decision-making (SDM) among racial and ethnic minority patients and providers? lower level of empathy towards minority patients contribute to racial and ethnic differences in patient-provider communication. Despite robust evidence documenting the important role of poor communication in healthcare disparities, few interventions have been developed to improve patient-provider communication among minority groups. Moreover, interventions to reduce mental healthcare disparities are lacking. This study seeks to improve patient-provider communication, specifically minority Veterans? participation in SDM to reduce mental health disparities. SDM is a patient-provider communication strategy, widely recognized for engaging patients in their own healthcare and is associated to positive patients? health outcomes. Current efforts to improve patients? participation in SDM, especially in mental healthcare, are limited by lack of understanding and integration of patients? social contexts in their treatment, such as their lived experiences ? an important barrier to address, and inadequate attention to precursors to SDM such as patient engagement. Therefore, the primary objectives of this study are to 1) (Aim 1) adapt the George Washington University (GWU) patient navigation intervention, a health disparity evidence-based intervention in cancer care, to increase minority Veterans? participation in SDM; 2) (Aim 2) refine and evaluate the intervention; and 3) (Aim 3) use systems redesign methods to conduct pre-implementation planning to facilitate effective intervention implementation in VA mental health settings. We will use an ecological framework that emphasizes sociocultural contexts in health communication and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to guide the development and implementation of the proposed intervention. To accomplish Aim 1, we will elicit iterative feedback from Veterans, providers, peers, and other stakeholders from multiple VA facilities within VISN 10, in conjunction with an ethnographic study of Veterans and peers in mental health services. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the intervention at one site on a sample of (N=50) Veterans and using a randomized controlled trial design that will consist of an experimental (intervention) and control (treatment as usual) groups. We will refine the intervention based on this pilot study, and lay the foundation for a multi-sited, hybrid I randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine its effectiveness in improving patient activation, patient engagement, and SDM. In Aim 3, we will use system redesign methods, guided by CFIR, to conduct pre-implementation planning. We will assess systems- level processes that could impact the future implementation of the proposed intervention. Qualitative data from the study will be coded and analyzed using an inductive/deductive approach, informed by our ecological and CFIR frameworks. Statistical analyses of the self-reported measures will provide patient outcomes data. Findings from this study will contribute to the VA?s efforts to improve patient-provider communication and reduce VA mental healthcare disparities. This study could affect the delivery of mental healthcare to minority Veterans in the VA."

In response to PAR 10-257, NCD Lifespan Award and the South African Governmental Report, Revitalizing Clinical Research, which calls for the training of master's-level students to improve their capacit to conduct addiction mental health research and provide additional clinical services, we propose to develop the Tirisano Training Project, or TTP (Tirisano means working together in Tswana). A collaborative training program between UCLA and several South African Universities and Institutions including faculty from the University of Cape Town (UCT), the University of Stellenbosch, the Human Sciences Research Council, and North West University will increase the clinical and research skills of South African post-bachelor, master's and doctoral-level students and early career mental health professionals. Expanding upon the infrastructure and lessons learned from our Fogarty-funded Phodiso trauma and health disparities research training program for South Africa scholars, TTP focuses on chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders including substance abuse, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across the life course. TTP addresses the dearth of South African researchers by targeting the pipeline challenge and training scholars at diverse points of the academic career path. Guided by a multi-dimensional conceptual model of risks and resilience resources over the lifespan, trainees will be provided the tools to develop and test novel models and methods to implement effective substance abuse and mental health interventions within the South African context. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Implement a short-, medium-, and long-term multidisciplinary training program at UCLA and in South Africa for master's and doctoral-level students and early career mental health professionals drawn from clinical staff working in nursing, social work, psychiatry and public health to enhance their knowledge and skills in the areas of chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders (Track A Scholars; cumulative n=16); 2) Implement a short-term multidisciplinary training program in South Africa for post-bachelor, master's and doctoral-level students in nursing, social work, and public health to enhance their knowledge and skills in the area of chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders (Track B Scholars; cumulative n=100); 3) Evaluate the TTP processes, including the mentoring, research skills, and career support provided, as well as the career trajectories and accomplishments of the Track A Scholars over 10 years; and 4) Assess the sustainability and integration of TTP into academic, private, and government agencies that provide substance abuse and mental health research and services. Future goals will include encouraging the South African government to support, endorse, and adopt TTP as a successful and replicable model of cross-cultural clinical research training."
"9528210","PROJECT SUMMARY Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite with the ability to infect virtually any nucleated cell from any mammalian or avian species. Most infections in humans are asymptomatic but as to evade the immune response the parasite converts to an encysted form, thus establishing a chronic infection. These cysts, which mostly form in neural and muscular tissues, are not static latent structures and parasites continue to divide within the cyst wall and cysts can rupture releasing parasites that go on to invade other cells. Thus, an inflammatory response is likely present during chronic Toxoplasma infection, which has been confirmed in the brain of infected mice. Whether chronic or intermittent inflammation and ensuing pathogenesis occurs in other organs during a Toxoplasma infection has not been fully explored. Of particular interest is the prostate, in which inflammation is associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. We have recently discovered that both tachyzoites and bradyzoites are present in the prostate of infected mice. Importantly, Toxoplasma infection in mice results in chronic prostate inflammation lasting beyond 60 days. Remarkably, infected prostates exhibit severe reactive hyperplasia and a histological pattern of ?microglandular? hyperplasia, two pathological features of human BPH not normally observed in murine models of prostate inflammation. Thus, it is our overall hypothesis that Toxoplasma infection contributes to prostate pathogenesis in humans. Pilot experiments indicate that markers of Toxoplasma infection are present in human BPH specimens and that men seropositive for Toxoplasma are more likely to have an elevated prostate serum antigen (PSA), a marker of prostate inflammation, than seronegative individuals. These preliminary results provide strong rationale to investigate a possible co-relation between Toxoplasma and prostatic disease. Accordingly, we will perform a retrospective analysis of serum, cDNA and tissue from men with symptomatic BPH compared to non- diseased men, correlating Toxoplasma exposure with inflammation, hyperplasia, cytokine and growth factor expression. Additionally, we will use our mouse infection model to study the mechanisms of Toxoplasma's propagation and pathogenesis in the prostate. Specifically, we will test whether Toxoplasma can infect the prostate through a natural infectious route, whether the parasite persists in the prostate as either a chronic or acute infection, and whether the effects of infection are global or constrained to invaded cells. Finally, we will perform transcriptomic analysis of infected prostate cells to determine the molecular effects of infection in these particular cells. By focusing on an unexplored aspect of Toxoplasma infection, the proposed work will reveal novel mechanistic information about Toxoplasma's interaction with its host and potentially uncover a possible connection between one of the most common parasites of humans and prostate disease."
"9476206","Accumulation of A? peptide in the brain appears to initiate disease onset and causes of many of the cognitive and behavioral symptoms related to Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Other pathologies such as hyperphosphorylated tau as neurofibrillary tangles and ?-synuclein (?-syn) as Lewy Bodies are also detrimental in AD. While Lewy Bodies are best known for accumulation within the striatum in Parkinson?s disease, similar structures also composed of ?-syn are present in 60% of AD cases. Given that A? and ?-syn pathologies often co-exist, our goal is to understand the complex biology of both peptides and how they interact to influence the development and progression of AD. A? is normally produced in neurons and secreted into the brain extracellular fluid, or interstitial fluid (ISF), which is one source of A? that forms oligomers and plaques. Conversion of A? from its normal soluble form into these toxic conformations is concentrationdependent; high levels of A? are much more prone to aggregate than lower concentrations of A?. A balance between A? generation and elimination determines the steady-state concentration of A? in the brain. A? levels rise dramatically in AD, suggesting that at least one of these metabolic processes is disrupted in the diseased brain. Recent studies strongly suggests that a key factor leading to A? accumulation in the AD brain is a defect in clearing the peptide from the brain. Several mechanisms involved in active A? clearance from the brain have been identified, such as 1) proteolytic degradation, 2) cellular uptake, and 3) active transport across the bloodbrain barrier. While these clearance pathways work simultaneously to remove A? from the brain, the degree to which each mechanism works independently, competes, or cooperates remains unclear. Many studies have focused on how each of these mechanisms individually clear A?, however few have determined how these mechanisms work in synergy. Interestingly, some of these clearance pathways appear to act on A? as well as ?-synuclein. Overall, we hypothesize that clearance of A? and ?-syn does not occur in isolation, but instead is influenced by an array of mechanisms as well as by each other. We will identify how these pathways interact to clear A? from the brain by blocking one or more mechanism at a time and measuring the rate of A? clearance from the ISF. We will also determine differences in function of these clearance pathways in settings of combined pathology (?-syn and A?)."
"9486416","Genetic variation is the primary source of evolutionary innovation and a major factor responsible for phenotypic variation. Consequently, understanding such variation has great importance in both basic biology and evolution, and ultimately Mendelian and complex disease. We will study the origin of genetic variation through spontaneous mutational processes. Computational analysis of sequencing datasets will shed light on the mechanistic forces underlying germ-line and somatic cancer mutations in human. We will design new statistical models of de novo mutation that will have applications in population genetics, cancer genomics and genetics of neuropsychiatric disease. Next, we will improve computational methods for interpreting and predicting the effect of mutation on molecular function, including both coding and non-coding variation. Our methods integrate data from evolutionary genetics and biophysics and rely on comparative, functional and structural data. The newly developed methods will have applications in both medical and population genetics. We will study the population dynamics of alleles to estimate the forces that shape genetic variation within populations. We will rely on population genetics models to analyze evolutionary maintenance and genetic architecture of human phenotypes. Fascinated by the relationship between genotype and phenotype, we will combine theoretical models and statistical analysis of large-scale sequencing datasets to infer properties of the allelic architecture of complex traits. We will design new approaches to characterize and predict the genetic component of common disease risk. !"

She has served as primary or secondary research mentor for 33 pre- and post-doctoral trainees. Along with her position as Co-Director of the Brigham and Women's Hospital Lupus Center, Dr. Costenbader's mentoring is facilitated by her affiliations with several Harvard teaching and training programs. Moreover, the candidate's multiple ongoing patient-oriented research projects and collaborations, commitment to mentoring, and exceptional institutional resources provide an outstanding environment for the development of junior investigators in patient-oriented rheumatic disease research. This K24 grant would preserve Dr. Costenbader's protected time and relieve future clinical and administrative responsibilities.  The new research aims proposed will build upon past work in a large, nationwide lupus population with Medicaid data from 2000-2010. With data on over 66,000 lupus patients in the U.S., these studies will address key unanswered questions about cardiovascular disease risks, medical and surgical care, and outcomes. These important questions include whether cardiovascular disease risks are changing over time in this population, how post-cardiac event and intervention risks compare to those of the general population, whether lupus patients receive optimal cardiac care, and whether hydroxychloroquine reduces cardiovascular disease risks. The inherent sociodemographic variation and high medical risk of this vulnerable population make these studies extremely relevant for ongoing policy discussions about improving healthcare and outcomes. The findings of these powerful studies will inform future . Moreover, the proposed research studies will provide excellent mentoring opportunities. Dr. Costenbader will continue to recruit two to three new trainees into her rheumatic disease epidemiology and outcomes research program each year, and to expand and refine her formal mentoring program using feedback received from trainees, medical care and prescribing practices and seminars and lectures at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Based on institutional commitment and resources and Dr. Costenbader's successful record in research and mentoring, this K24 grant would greatly augment her ability to expand her existing research mentoring program and to develop the next generation of patient-oriented rheumatic disease investigators."
"9696111","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of high-throughput technologies has made it feasible to measure the activities of thousands of genes simultaneously, which provides scientists a major opportunity to infer global gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Accurate inference of GRNs is very important, which allows people to gain a systematic understanding of the molecular mechanism, to shed light on the mechanism of diseases that occur when cellular processed are dysregulated, and furthermore to identify potential therapeutic targets for diseases. Given the high dimensionality and high complexity of high-throughput data, inference of global GRNs largely relies on the advance of computational methods.  However, the current computational methods for inference of global GRNs are either inaccurate or computationally infeasible. How to infer global GRNs has put a great challenge on the current statistical methodology.  The investigators propose an equivalent measure of partial correlation coefficients, and based on which develop an innovative computational framework for inference of global GRNs. The new measure of partial correlation coefficients can be evaluated with a reduced conditional set and thus feasible for high dimensional problems. Under the new framework, the investigators develop a series of algorithms which are able to provide a comprehensive inference for global GRNs by integrating various types of high-throughput molecular profiling data, e.g., mRNA expression, copy number variation, methylation, microRNA, and protein expression, and adjusting with various clinical covariates, e.g., age, gender, and disease stage. The proposed algorithms are applied to infer the global GRNs for various types of cancer with a special focus on lung cancer, while they are applicable to all other types of diseases. Statistically, this project proposes an innovative framework for inference of global GRNs, and the algorithms developed under which are not only computationally efficient, but also very flexible in data integration, covariate adjustment, prior knowledge integration, and network comparison. Biomedically, this is the first study to integrate such comprehensive and complementary information using rigorous statistical methods to study the global GRNs for various types of cancer."
"9461598","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To compete in today's global, high-tech economy, we are becoming more dependent on workers and leaders prepared in STEM fields; however, national studies indicate that too few American students have the requisite knowledge and skills in science and mathematics to participate fully in today's economy. We are falling behind in the global race for human capital development. The United States trails sixteen countries in Europe and Asia in the proportion of each country's college population who earn degrees in science and engineering (PCAST, 2010). This proposal seeks funding to support The Scripps Research Institute's Health-Related Research Experiences for Undergraduates (H-REU Program) - a program that creates a dynamic and stimulating educational and research environment, provides undergraduate students with the opportunity to conduct cutting-edge research in a laboratory, and inspires them to choose STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) careers. The specific aims of the program parallel the goals articulated in the NHLBI Short-Term Research Education Program to Increase Diversity in Health-Related Research (R25) announcement. We seek to: (1) develop a partnership with schools and organizations that target underrepresented and underserved students; (2) increase the number of students who consider careers in the biomedical research field; (2) provide research opportunities in cutting-edge health-related laboratories and mentoring opportunities with world-renowned scientists; and (3) increase the interns' proficiency in communicating scientific concepts and comfort level in the laboratory setting. The H-REU Program offers its participants an academic structure that integrates hands-on laboratory research with professional skills development and mentoring. The program consists of a ten-week enriched summer research experience and a mentorship with Scripps Research faculty and scientists. Each of the major program components, curriculum and professional development workshops and research experiences is made up of several elements that work together and provide a stepwise, scaffolding approach to improving interns' critical thinking skills, scientific preparation, knowledge base, and research expertise. By providing this experience, we hope to create a feeder pipeline and encourage the most talented students to pursue careers in biomedical research; however, those who do not become researchers will benefit by applying learned perspectives and honed professional skills to their future educational endeavors. Given its importance, STEM literacy must be a part of the educational foundation of all students no matter their future educational endeavors. (End of Abstract)"
"9482757","PROJECT SUMMARY Matrix stiffening is a defining feature of lung and liver fibrosis. While traditionally viewed as an endpoint, matrix stiffening is now recognized to develop early during fibrosis initiation, and to contribute prominently to disease progression through mechano-activation of myofibroblasts derived from lung fibroblasts (LFs) or hepatic stellate cell (HSCs). Recent studies by our group and others have identified the transcriptional effectors YAP and TAZ as key mediators of LF and HSC mechano-activation, demonstrating that a common molecular mechanism underlies myofibroblast activation in these two organs. Here we propose to dramatically expand our focus on YAP and TAZ not just as responders to matrix stiffness, but as central effectors that initiate, amplify, and maintain the matrix stiffening driven by LFs and HSCs, and thus highlight their potential as targets for therapy directed at matrix stiffening itself. In our first aim we will elucidate the mechanistic roles that YAP and TAZ play in initiation, maintenance and propagation of LF- and HSC-mediated lung and liver stiffening, using xenografting to study cell-mediated stiffening of the intact organ, and cellular remodeling of a model ECM to elucidate specific contributions of YAP and TAZ to matrix stiffening via extracellular matrix contraction, synthesis, crosslinking and breakdown. Recognizing that YAP and TAZ play prominent roles in a multitude of cell types and contexts, in our second aim we seek to identify mechanisms by which LF/HSC-specific pro- fibrotic activation of YAP and TAZ can be selectively ablated. We focus on a mechanistic approach to target G protein coupled receptor signaling through a Gs/cAMP pathway as a cell-specific mechanism to inactivate YAP and TAZ and ablate LF and HSC activation even in the face of pro-fibrotic stiff matrix conditions. Invasive atomic force microscopy (AFM) and non-invasive magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) approaches will be employed to test the efficacy of targeting these pathways in preventing or reversing matrix stiffening in pre- clinical models of lung and liver fibrosis. The proposed studies will elucidate novel molecular mechanisms linking cellular activation to matrix stiffening in vitro and in vivo, and identify new approaches to ablate LF and HSC activation in a cell-specific manner, important first steps toward new therapies targeting matrix stiffness and fibrosis. Validation of MRE as a metric to evaluate therapeutic targeting and clinical progression of matrix stiffening will position us to translate this approach to the clinic for patients with fibrotic diseases of the lung and liver."

We will use whole genome sequencing (WGS) and whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify rare and predicted pathogenic de novo and inherited sequence, copy number, and structural variants in sporadic CDH cases, and inherited variants in families containing more than one affected individual. A challenge in studying CDH, like most birth defects, has been its genetic heterogeneity. To overcome this obstacle, we have maximized our sample size by combining two well-established CDH research studies, generating one of the largest and most well-characterized cohorts of patients with CDH in the world. We have recruited 1500 patients to date, with WES or WGS data completed or in the pipeline for approximately 800 proband-parent trios. We show that this will provide sufficient power to identify multiple CDH genes with statistical significance. These data will be analyzed using novel and well- established bioinformatics tools to prioritize variants and identify molecular pathways that are likely to be disease-associated. In addition, the DHREAMS consortium has collected diaphragm specimens from a large number of patients, allowing for the study of somatic mutations and tissue-specific gene expression changes that may be associated with genetic subtypes of CDH. Together, the data derived from these large-scale genomic experiments have already identified key candidate genes that are being pursued in functional experiments in Projects II and III, and will continue to provide novel candidates that will allow identification of genotype-phenotype associations, help inform and refine prognosis for patients with CDH, and will elucidate molecular pathways that could be targets for future therapeutic strategies."
"9509289","Project Summary/Abstract There are around 50 known viruses in the Arenavirus family. These include Lassa (LASV), Lujo (LUJV), Machupo (MACV), and Junín (JUNV), which cause hemorrhagic fever in Africa and South America. The prototypic arenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), also causes encephalitis and birth defects in humans worldwide. Arenaviruses express one glycoprotein on their surface, termed GPC, which is responsible for receptor engagement, cell tropism, and entry. Understanding the structure of GPC, particularly in its trimeric, prefusion conformation, is key to understanding why the different arenaviruses recognize distinct receptors and in designing therapeutics and vaccines against them. However, the GPC is metastable: it easily disassembles into its component subunits and then springs into its more stable, post-fusion conformation. This metastability hindered structural biology efforts for years. Indeed, there has been no structure of any trimeric, prefusion arenavirus GP until this year. A ten-year protein engineering effort in the lab recently culminated in the crystal structure of LASV GP in its trimeric, prefusion complex, the first such structure for any arenavirus. This landmark structure illuminated new findings: that the properly assembled prefusion trimer is essential for recognition by the most effective neutralizing antibodies and for recognition by the LASV and LCMV cell surface receptor matriglycan. In the absence of stably engineered prefusion GP, such potently protective antibodies would have been difficult to identify and characterize. There remains, however, no trimeric prefusion GP structure for any other arenavirus. Fortunately, the model built for LASV GP provides the blueprints we need to propel this effort forward. The premise of this proposal is that the correct quaternary assembly of GP can be engineered for other arenaviruses using the LASV GP structure as a template and the foundation of knowledge laid by this structure. We will combine strong preliminary results and state-of the-art biophysical techniques, with bio-layer interferometry and ELISA to analyze the interaction of engineered MACV, JUNV, LCMV and LUJV GPs with their distinct receptors and with unique panels of antibodies from human survivors (JUNV and LUJV) and mice (MACV and LCMV). In aim 1 we will develop the stable prefusion GPs necessary to determine if MACV and JUNV, like LASV, also elicit quaternary-epitope antibodies and the stoichiometry by which these viruses bind their TfR1 receptor. In aim 2 we will develop the GPs necessary to solve an LCMV-matriglycan complex, map the epitopes of LCMV-binding antibodies and identify and characterize LUJV GP antibodies and the LUJV GP structure involved in its atypical mechanism of entry. Multiple lines of inquiry will be launched by the innovative research effort proposed here."
"9459345","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease, diabetes, and obesity remain major clinical problems worldwide and elevated plasma triglyceride (TG) levels constitute an independent risk factor. Discovered in 2001, apolipoprotein AV (apoAV) is a protein synthesized and secreted by the liver and is found to be inversely proportional to plasma TG levels. Mice and humans lacking functional apoAV have markedly elevated plasma TG while mice with high expression of human apoAV have dramatically decreased plasma TG. Curiously, plasma concentrations of apoAV are extremely low compared with other apolipoproteins such as apoB and apoAI. It has fascinated investigators for years that such a low circulating apolipoprotein can exert such a profound effect on plasma TG. We believe we have some novel insight to this question and this involves apoAV's action on the formation and secretion of chylomicrons (CM) by the enterocytes. Our preliminary data show that: 1) apoAV knockout (KO) animals were significantly more efficient in the absorption and lymphatic transport of both triglyceride (TG) an cholesterol than WT animals; 2) apoAV-KO animals have shorter CM appearance time than WT animals; 3) apoAV-KO animals release more pre-CM transport vesicles (PCTV) from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) than WT animals; 4) apoAV-KO animals secrete more apoB48 (therefore more CM particles since there is one apoB48 per particle) into lymph than WT animals; 5) apoAV is associated with CM in lymph during active fat absorption; and 6) apoAV is present in bile. We hypothesize that apoAV secreted by the liver regulates the intracellular formation and secretion of chylomicrons by the enterocytes and this regulation is mediated via biliary delivery and uptake of apoAV from the intestinal lumen. We will test these hypotheses in two specific aims. AIM 1: To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased lymphatic transport of TG and cholesterol by apoAV-KO mice. There are four subaims to investigate the molecular mechanism of how apoAV modulates the formation and secretion of CM by the small intestine. The role of apoAV in CM and VLDL pathways for the transport of esterified FA will be determined. Taking advantage of our ability to label and isolate intestinal CM, the role of apoAV on CM metabolism will also be studied. AIM 2: Using recombinant apoAV in apoAV-KO animals, we will determine the effect of restoring apoAV in the circulation on intestinal CM transport. We will determine the effect of restoring hepatic production of apoAV to knockout animals (thus restoring both circulating and biliary apoAV) on intestinal CM transport. Lastly, we will determine directly the role of biliary apoAV in the lumen of apoAV-KO animals on lipid and apolipoprotein secretion by the gut, and study the uptake and lymphatic transport of 35S methionine labeled apoAV by the intestine will be studied."

"9551662","PROJECT III: FUNCTIONAL EVALUATION OF CDH PATIENT GENE VARIANTS IN VITRO AND IN SELECT ANIMAL MODELS ABSTRACT  Significant progress has been made in the care of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) patients in the past two decades. Survival rates have been steadily improving, in part because of gentle ventilation techniques, high-frequency ventilation, cardiovascular pharmacologic support, and ECMO.  Currently, the main therapeutic goal is to stabilize the cardiac and respiratory systems in CDH infants, while attempting to minimize iatrogenic (therapy-induced) injury to the delicate pulmonary tissue, before undergoing surgical repair of the diaphragm. Lengthy stays in the neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU) are often necessary. Despite these successes, a large number of infants still succumb to the pulmonary complications of CDH, with late deaths mostly due to pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary insufficiency.  A major pulmonary defect associated with CDH is insufficient gas exchange, and pathology sections indicate that this is likely due to reduced number of alveolar septa. At the same time, a major contribution to lethality of infants with CDH is severe pulmonary hypertension due to abnormal vascular and vascular smooth muscle development, as well as failure of the vascular smooth muscle to relax normally after birth.  Using a complementary set of mammalian genetic, genomic, physiological, and three-dimensional morphological approaches, we propose to characterize in vitro and in vivo the pulmonary defects of CDH model organisms focusing on postnatal timing and cell types, including myofibroblasts and extracellular matrix constituents such as elastin. By identifying molecular mechanisms affected by different genetic mutations, we will design molecular assays that could eventually provide new paradigms for therapy, and reduce the economic, societal, and personal burden of CDH."
"9485991","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a common condition in the older population and associated with worse morbidity and mortality compared to younger individuals. Various self-management behaviors (SMB), medication adherence in particular, are key for achieving good asthma control. Unfortunately, less than half of older asthmatics regularly adhere to their controller medications and to other SMB. Several observations suggest that symptom perception may be a major determinant of asthma SMB and outcomes in older adults. First, experimental studies consistently demonstrate that many older adults are substantially less aware of their level of airway obstruction. Second, under-perception of asthma symptoms is linked to elevated risk of near-fatal and fatal asthma attacks and increased morbidity among younger adults. Third, cognitive impairment, commonly associated with aging, has been identified as a key determinant of under-perception of symptoms in younger asthmatics. Fourth, interventions to correct symptom under-perception in children have been shown to improve asthma medication adherence. Despite the greater vulnerability of older asthmatics to poor asthma outcomes and their diminished ability to perceive the severity of their airway obstruction, the association of symptom perception with asthma SMB and outcomes has not been studied in this population. The goal of this project is to determine how symptom perception influences the management and outcomes of older asthmatics and to pilot test an intervention to correct under-perception. The Specific Aims are: 1) Prospectively assess the association between symptom perception and asthma morbidity among older adults; 2) Examine the association between symptom perception and asthma SMB among older adults and identify the pathways (via illness and medication beliefs) linking them; 3) Determine the influence of cognition on symptom perception among older adults with asthma; 4) Pilot test an intervention to correct under-perceptions of asthma symptoms in older adults. We will conduct a prospective cohort study of 400 asthmatics ?60 years of age recruited from East Harlem and the Bronx in New York City. We will measure symptom perception in naturalistic settings using an innovative and validated methodology and repeatedly collect data on illness and medication beliefs, cognitive functioning, SMB (including objective measures of medication adherence), and asthma morbidity over 12 months. At the end of the observation period, we will pilot test an intervention to improve symptom perception on a random sample of 80 participants. The proposed study is significant for its potential to greatly advance understanding of the mechanisms related to low adherence to SMB and worse outcomes in older asthmatics, a vulnerable and understudied population."

"9459328","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Between 2000 and 2012 cigar, cigarillo, and little cigar (CCLC) use has increased 124%. Adolescents and young adults are the most prevalent users. For some states and urban school districts, including Cleveland, Ohio, the use of CCLC among adolescents now exceeds the use of cigarettes. Despite the increase in CCLC use among youth, attention to potential nicotine dependence (ND) among users of these products has been largely ignored. Recent evidence shows that users of CCLC do inhale when smoking and that, when compared to cigarettes, CCLC products contain as much if not more of the highly addictive chemical nicotine. Therefore, assessing ND among CCLC users is an important step to inform the extent to which these products are causing harm among users and thus, should be subjected to the same regulations as cigarettes. Patterns of use and the speed and method with which nicotine is physically received differ by tobacco product; because of this Fagerstrom and colleagues suggest that product-specific measures are needed to more precisely assess the level of ND among users. To our knowledge no measure of ND has been adapted for CCLC users nor has there been a new measure created for this purpose. This represents a significant gap in research we aim to address by establishing a measure of ND symptoms that is relevant, valid and reliable for adolescents and young adult CCLC users. Using an array of rigorous methods including qualitative in-depth interviews, Rasch modeling for measure development, and survey and biomarker data, the proposed project will contribute to the reliable and valid measurement of ND among CCLC users. The final CCLC ND measure will be administered to large samples of adolescents using the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) to assess the prevalence of ND symptoms among CCLC users. The findings from this study will guide decisions regarding the appropriate implementation and scope of CCLC product regulation that is parallel to cigarettes with regard to warning labels, harmful constituent reporting, and regulation of other aspects that have been shown to influence youth access to and consumption of tobacco projects including packaging and product placement for sale."
"9454498","Neuroplasticity is a key mechanism underlying post-stroke recovery of motor function. Brain imaging research provides evidence that these beneficial neural changes are experience-dependent and therefore related to rehabilitative interventions that target movement deficits. Recently, non-invasive brain stimulation has been identified as a means to improve the neurophysiological conditions for neuroplasticity to occur in ways that enhance, support and accelerate the rehabilitation process. The Pi's previous work has demonstrated the therapeutic potential of lesioned-hemisphere repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (LH-rTMS) as a therapy-adjuvant to improve paretic upper extremity (UE) function post-stroke. Other groups have similarly shown that non-lesioned hemisphere rTMS (NLH-rTMS) also improves paretic UE movement. Thus, there is controversy over which hemisphere is the better target of rTMS. We have argued that LH-rTMS promotes increased motor cortex (MC) activation supporting motor re-learning, while others have argued that NLH-rTMS inhibits the negative influences that the NLH exerts on the LH via excessive transcallosal inhibition. To date, no study has tested LH-rTMS against NLH-rTMS in the chronic post-stroke recovery phase. Although we hypothesize that the LH is the better target to promote motor re-learning and recovery-related neuroplasticity, we must test this hypothesis before moving to a large clinical trial on LH-rTMS. The goal of the proposed project is to directly evaluate the differences in the efficacy of LH-rTMS vs. NLH-rTMS. This project will provide the first-ever evidence on the effects of LH-rTMS vs. NLH-rTMS through the integration of a comprehensive set of brain imaging, neurophysiological and motor performance outcome assessments. We hypothesize that LH-rTMS will produce significantly greater motor improvements and neurological changes than NLH-rTMS. This hypothesis will be tested in a prospective, stimulation+rehabilitation design in which 40 chronic stroke survivors will be randomized to 4 weeks of either LH-rTMS or NLH-rTMS, each of which will be combined with task-oriented rehabilitation that will immediately follow each daily dose of rTMS. The aims are to: 1) Determine the differential effects of LH-rTMS vs. NLH rTMS on a range of upper limb motor function outcomes in survivors of stroke, and 2) Determine the differential effects of LH-rTMS vs. NLH rTMS on neurophysiological and neuroimaging markers of neuroplasticity outcomes."
"9494232","PROJECT SUMMARY  In this application, we propose to acquire a Chirascan V100 combination circular dichroism spectropolarimeter and fluorescence spectrophotometer from Applied Photophysics that will be placed in a newly created shared instrumentation facility such that it will be available for use by the entire biomedical research community at Columbia University, thereby impacting the large number of current and future NIH-funded research programs at Columbia University. The Chirascan V100 instrument will be installed, housed, operated, and maintained in the Precision Biomolecular Characterization Facility (PBCF), a newly created, university-supported, staffed, shared instrumentation facility that will provide efficient, low-cost access for all Columbia University researchers. This state-of-the-art instrument will be equipped with fluorescence polarization anisotropy capabilities, Peltier thermal stage, auto-titrator, and stopped flow mixer to enable the broadest range of research to be accommodated. The only comparable instruments currently at Columbia University and neighboring institutions are all located in the laboratories of individual researchers, not shared instrumentation facilities. Consequently, these instruments are not available for routine use by the broader Columbia University research community. Moreover, all of these instruments either have limited capabilities, are approaching the end of their useable lifetimes, and/or have reached the end of their useable lifetimes. Successfully establishing this instrument in the PBCF is expected to advance the aims of more than 45 NIH-funded research programs spanning 10 departments and 3 schools at Columbia University that represent an extremely broad range of biochemical, biophysical, and biomedical research programs."
"9485577","Abstract The combination of metal ions with proteins offers unique chemical reactivities, which are at the heart of many of Nature's most amazing chemical transformations. My laboratory interrogates how metalloenzymes harness the reactivity of supernucleophiles and radical cofactors, while protecting themselves from potential damage. It is an incredibly exciting time to be studying metalloenzymes. Bioinformatics and genomic studies are identifying new putative metalloenzymes at a dizzying pace, with more than 100,000 unique sequences now associated with the Radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme family alone. Characterization of these enzymes is revealing unprecedented chemistry and new cofactor-binding structural motifs. Impressively, many of these Radical SAM (RS) enzymes are part of biosynthetic pathways that produce natural products with novel molecular scaffolds and promising pharmaceutical properties (including antibiotic, antiviral, and anti- tumor properties). My laboratory is employing our favorite technique of X-ray crystallography to probe sequence space within this family with the goal of understanding how RS enzymes harness radical-species to perform chemically challenging reactions. In the next five years, we will leverage recent success and continue to investigate the structure/function of cobalamin-dependent RS enzymes. This 7000-membered RS subgroup represents a new set of challenges and opportunities to understand how Nature tunes and controls both radical and supernucleophile reactivities. It is not only the RS enzyme family that has been in the spotlight recently; the glycyl radical enzyme (GRE) family is also receiving increased attention. In this latter case, the human microbiome project is providing new information as to the importance and abundance of GREs in the human gut and oral cavities. For example, the most abundant uncharacterized enzyme found in the gut is a GRE! In the next five years, we plan to investigate several newly discovered members of the GRE family that appear to be key players in human microbial communities. Our goal is to use our structural tools to interrogate the molecular basis for the radical-based chemistry that contributes to microbial metabolism, and potentially pathogenesis, in the human gut. A number of these GREs are found in common pathogens, like C. difficile, and are potential drug targets. Finally, it is a great period to be working on the ?great clusters of life,? which are responsible for the fixation of carbon (C-cluster/A-cluster), nitrogen (MoFe cluster) and hydrogen (H-cluster). My laboratory focuses on carbon fixation and the C- and A-clusters of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl- CoA synthase. Recent advances have afforded recombinant systems that are allowing us to probe cluster assembly, reaction mechanism, and oxygen-sensitivity in a manner that was not possible previously. Oxygen- sensitivity is the Achilles heel of a complex metalloprotein and we plan to use our structural toolbox to investigate the molecular basis of C-cluster oxygen-sensitivity."
"9585530","Abstract Differentiation of CD4 T cells into functionally distinct effector subsets has been intensively studied in vitro and the subset-specific roles of CD4 T cells have been also considered important in vivo. TH1 CD4 T cells, which express T-bet and IFN-?, are thought to be important for both adaptive and innate immune responses to infection by intracellular pathogens and cancers. However, since T-bet is expressed in both CD4 and CD8 T cells, and IFN-? is expressed by other cell populations, such as CD8 T cells and NK cells, the conventional conditional knockout or germline knockout approaches have failed to specifically demonstrate the requirement for TH1 cells in vivo. To address this fundamental question, we have developed a new genetic tool and will define the roles of TH1 cells in vivo using viral infection models."
"9465837","Abstract This project seeks to develop the next generation pro-CARs that are inactive in normal tissues but selectively activated in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The project is based on our previous development of a novel class of chimeric antigen receptors on the basis of single domain antibody mimics that recognize ErbB family members (SDAErbB) on the surface of cancer cells. We propose two specific aims in this project. The first aim is to develop a pro-SDAErbB-CAR that is inactive in normal tissues due to the blockade of the antigen-binding sites by an N-terminal prodomain, but selectively activated in TME through proteolytic cleavage of the prodomain by matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2/-9 highly expressed in TME or by fibroblast activation protein-? (FAP) abundant in the reactive tumor stromal fibroblasts. The second aim is to develop a novel class of CAR that integrates a chemotactic chemokine, which upon being delivered by CAR T-cells and locally released to TME, will attract endogenous cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) to the tumor site to provide higher and enduring antitumor efficacy in a TME-specific manner. The two complementary CAR T-cell platforms have significant advantages on high efficacy and specificity to tumor cells but very low side toxicity and improved safety to normal cells, and therefore the great potential to be applied to treat numerous solid tumors. Although we focus on EGFR- and HER3-specific CARs in this project, the same technology platform can be applied to develop numerous other CARs that target neoantigens, for the treatment of solid tumors of interest."
"9548773","While substantial progress have been made in the global HIV response, impact have been uneven. Uganda provides a prime case study. Uganda was an early epicenter of the epidemic, with the first report of ?slim disease? in East Africa published by our group in 1985. Over the next two decades, Uganda was a leader in efforts to control the epidemic. More recently, new HIV infections remain substantial, particularly in hard-to- reach subpopulations, and the modern Ugandan response to the HIV epidemic presents an improving but mixed picture. Despite moderate scale-up of HIV services, it is estimated that there are still approximately 28,000 yearly AIDS-related deaths and 83,000 new infections in the setting of suboptimal antiretroviral therapy and male circumcision coverage. High mobility, suboptimal linkage and retention in care, persistent high risky sexual behaviors, and an incomplete understanding of HIV transmission dynamics continue to compromise an optimal response. Adding to these challenges are the increasing identification of HIV ?hotspots? in Uganda, geographic areas of high HIV burden, where HIV services are often limited. Uganda, like most PEPFAR countries, has adopted more aggressive approaches, including Test and Treat All and introducing Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). However, the impact of these approaches is unclear and will need close monitoring to understand their implementation and impact. This complexities of HIV transmission dynamics and responses raise many critical research questions which impact both Ugandan and Sub-Saharan African policies and programs. In order to address these research areas, it is essential that local capacity be strengthened. In particular, we believe capacity must be built in a multidisciplinary fashion to better understand and reduce HIV incidence in Uganda and beyond, a high priority NIH research area. Our group has a long and successful legacy of training leaders in HIV research and are strongly positioned to build upon this foundation. We propose a multidisciplinary approach to developing scientific capacity in Uganda which will emphasize 3 synergistic areas: (1) Implementation Science, (2) Geospatial Analysis/Infectious Disease Dynamics and (3) Virology/Immunology/HIV Cure. These disciplines span the clinic, community, modeling, and the lab sciences and will ensure that we reach the long-term goals and objectives of the program, which are that Ugandan institutions will have the research capacity needed to understand, respond to, and eventually control the HIV epidemic. We will involve 22 trainees in multidisciplinary bachelor, master's, PhD, and post- graduate level training, mostly in Uganda. The primary beneficiaries of this training will be the Rakai Health Sciences Program and the Makerere University School of Public Health in Uganda with whom Johns Hopkins University, the applicant institution, has had a highly successful collaborative relationship for 30 years. Our anticipated outcome is to have developed a world-class cadre of Ugandan research capacity capable of leading Uganda to the end of its HIV epidemic."
"9475175","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT - PROJECT 1  Presently, there can be considerable uncertainty in the clinical diagnosis of the common neurodegenerative pathological dementia syndromes [AD, LBD and FTD] antemortem because of clinical heterogeneity (wherein the dementia underlying pathology does not match the clinical syndrome), subtle symptoms early in the disease process, and frequent occurrence of mixed dementias. The central aim of this proposal is to develop a methodology that uses the wealth of clinical, imaging and pathology data collected in past and current ADRC funding cycles to improve the antemortem prediction of the dementia pathology and long-term clinical outcomes in new incoming patients. Our working hypothesis is that an individual subject's cognitive performance can be approximately modeled based on the subjects multi-modal imaging scans which are surrogates of pathology, cognitive reserve, MRI evidence of CVD and demographics. Based on this hypothesis, we plan to integrate clinical, pathology and imaging information on about 370+ demented patients with autopsy diagnosis and at least one imaging exam available before death from the past and current ADRC cycles and use this information for diagnosis and prognosis of new incoming patients. The overall methodology which we will create will operate as follows: 1) identify the patients (matched subjects) in our database who match the new incoming patient based on the multi-modal images, cognitive reserve, vascular disease and demographics and 2) use the matched subjects to aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of the new patient."
"9470808","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapidly growing world population and the high rate of unintended pregnancies make contraception a need and a priority for any public health program. While several contraceptive methods for women are currently available, a more comprehensive approach to birth control requires extending contraception to males. However, a safe, effective and reversible contraceptive for men is still unavailable. An attractive approach t develop male contraceptives consists in targeting proteins that are specifically expressed in sperm and are required for sperm fertility. Evidence from our laboratory has shown that Na,K-ATPase ?4, a sperm specific plasma membrane transporter, which exchanges cytoplasmic Na+ for extracellular K+ is one of these attractive targets for male contraception. Na,K-ATPase ?4 is only expressed in male germ cells of the testis after meiosis and abundant in the sperm flagellum. Importantly, ?4 has functional characteristics that are highly unique and critical for sperm function. Activity of ?4 is essential for maintaining sperm intracellular Na+ levels ([Na+]i) and several vital sperm parameters, including membrane potential (Vm), intracellular Ca+2 ([Ca2+]i) and pH. Importantly, ?4 is crucial for sperm motility and hyperactivation, a key event associated with sperm capacitation. Accordingly, knockout of ?4 in mice results in complete male infertility. From a biochemical standpoint, ?4 has a particularly high affinity for the cardenolide ouabain. We have developed a series of synthetic compounds with steroidal and non-steroidal backbone structure, which, by targeting the ouabain binding site of ?4, selectively inhibit ?4 and affect sperm motility. These results provide strong evidence for the suitability of ?4 as a pharmacological target for the control of male fertility. The key to targeting Na,K-ATPase ?4 is that inhibition of this protein will allow to specifically interfere with sperm function, without affecting spermatogenesis and providing temporary and reversible contraception. In addition, the lack of ?4 in somatic cells reduces the chances that its inactivation will produce side effects. However, before the ?4 inhibitors can be moved forward into their application as male contraceptives, it is necessary that their efficacy, drug-target interaction, biomarkers for their in vitro and vivo specificity, side effects and mechanisms of action are identified and optimized for future clinical use. We will test this here by determining the efficacy and selectivity of action of our inhibitors on Na,K-ATPase ?4 activity, on sperm motility and on sperm parameters that are controlled by Na,K-ATPase ?4 activity, including sperm [Na+]i, [Ca2+]i, pH, Vm, sperm hyperactivation, motility and fertility. Finally, we will determine the pharmacokinetic parameters, safety and contraceptive effectiveness of Na,K-ATPase ?4 inhibitors in mating trials in mice. The rationale for the research is that once the suitability of cardenolides as targets of Na,K-ATPase ?4 is validated, both in vitro and in vivo, they can be advanced as agents for the reversible control of male fertility."
"9472557","Project Summary Toxoplasma gondii is a common food borne pathogen. It is estimated that 1.5 million people in the U.S. alone become infected with T. gondii annually and this protozoan parasite is the second most prevalent deadly foodborne pathogen in United States. Our studies comparing T. gondii infected gnotobiotic (germ-free) animals to conventional mice have established that the immunostimulatory signals induced by commensal bacteria have major effects on the outcomes of the parasitic infections. We also found that microbiota potentiates IFN-? responses and intestinal inflammation via the TLR adaptor protein MyD88. We hypothesize that synergistic innate sensing of microbiota and the parasite regulates the outcome of IFN-? dependent host resistance and immunopathology. We propose to build upon these findings to gain a mechanistic understanding of how innate recognition of microbiota influences IFN-? production during T. gondii infection, what cell types are involved in producing protective and immunopathological IFN-?, and the physiological consequences of T. gondii and microbiota-driven IFN-?. The proposed project is innovative because it examines a new way to think about host-parasite interactions in the presence of microbiota. It brings together a natural model for T. gondii infection, innate immune receptors involved in sensing parasite and microbiota, and mechanisms that regulate the production of IFN-? at the sites of infection. In Aim 1, we will use mouse models and in vitro screening assays to identify innate immune sensors that regulate microbiota-dependent IFN-? production during T. gondii infection. In Aim 2, we will determine cell type-specific contributions of innate and adaptive immune cells in IFN-?-dependent host defense and intestinal pathology. In Aim 3, we will determine the impact of Paneth cells on T. gondii-induced intestinal pathogenesis by define biochemical pathways for T. gondii-induced Paneth cell death, and by defining the effects of Paneth cell loss on T. gondii-triggered intestinal pathogenesis using novel Paneth cell reporter and Paneth cell-deficient mice generated in our lab. These studies will advance our understanding of the protective and pathological effects of IFN-? during T. gondii infection."
"9480847","PROJECT SUMMARY Health research using mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, is becoming more common. New hardware and software can transform a mobile device into a sophisticated data collection and analytical platform. These technologies are fundamentally changing health research because the recruitment, data collection, and data sharing are conducted online without any face-to-face interaction between researchers and research participants. Increasingly, this research also is being conducted by researchers who do not receive any federal funding and are not subject to the Common Rule, the FDA research regulations, and the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Yet, unregulated health research using mobile devices raises numerous important ethical issues including external review, recruitment, inclusion and exclusion criteria, informed consent, privacy and security, incidental findings, and data sharing. This project has the following three aims: Aim 1: Conduct in-depth qualitative interviews to elicit thought leaders' perspectives on the risks and appropriate protections for participants in unregulated health research using mobile devices. Aim 2: Develop a detailed analysis of the ELSI issues through a series of 4 meetings by a diverse, expert working group, and use a consensus-building methodology to develop recommendations. Aim 3: Devise and implement educational programs and translation of the consensus recommendations.  Sub-aim 3-1: Because app developers play a key role in mobile health innovations, we will hold 2  workshops exclusively for app developers on ethical issues in designing mobile health apps, with video  highlights posted on the internet.  Sub-aim 3-2: We will hold a conference in Washington, DC, on policy issues of interest to the NIH,  FDA, OHRP, FTC, Congressional staffs, state governments, professional organizations, researchers,  IRBs, patient groups, and other stakeholders.  Sub-aim 3-3: Members of the working group will draft 20 articles containing consensus policy  recommendations for publication in a special symposium issue of the Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics.  Sub-aim 3-4: We will present our findings and recommendations at meetings of consumers,  professionals, and policy makers."
"9424897","Project Summary Pain is a multidimensional experience that involves sensory, cognitive and affective factors. The constellation of interactions between these factors renders the treatment of chronic pain challenging and often a financial burden. In fact, chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans and costs the United States approximately $635 billion dollars a year. The widespread use of opioids to treat chronic pain has led to the so-called ?opioid epidemic? due to the exponential growth in opioid misuse and addiction. These staggering statistics highlight the importance of developing, testing and validating fast-acting, non-pharmacological approaches to treat pain. Mindfulness meditation is a technique that has been found to significantly reduce pain in experimental and clinical settings. However, lack of mechanistic data and the assumption that extensive meditation training is required to experience analgesia has limited the clinical deployment of this cost-effective and narcotic-free treatment. Recent findings from our laboratory determined that mindfulness meditation, after only four sessions (20 minutes/session) of training, dramatically reduces pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings. Across two functional neuroimaging studies, employing perfusion-based MRI (arterial spin labeling), we found that mindfulness meditation-induced pain relief was associated with greater activation of the right anterior insula (aINS), orbitofrontal (OFC) and subgenual anterior cingulate (sgACC) cortex. We have also found that meditation-related analgesia was associated with significant thalamic deactivation. These findings demonstrate that mindfulness meditation reduces pain through multiple brain mechanisms related to increased cognitive control, emotion regulation and attenuation of ascending nociceptive input. However, these results cannot be generalized to chronic pain because they were associated with healthy, pain-free participants and thermally induced pain. Importantly, the brain mechanisms supporting the modulation of chronic pain by mindfulness meditation remain unknown. Thus, the central aim of the proposed R01 study is to determine the specific mechanisms supporting the modulation of acutely exacerbated chronic low-back pain, the most prevalent and financially burdensome chronic pain condition, by acutely trained mindfulness meditation. We will determine if the neural mechanisms found to attenuate experimentally induced pain by mindfulness meditation (i.e., OFC, sgACC, thalamus) are also associated with modulating chronic low back pain. It is also unknown how much training is required to enhance the hypothesized relationship between the brain mechanisms supporting mindfulness meditation and chronic low-back pain relief. Thus, we will examine if meditation, after longer bouts of meditation training, will increase the hypothesized relationship between meditation-induced brain activation (i.e., OFC, sgACC, aINS) and chronic low back pain relief. The knowledge to be gained from the proposed study will provide novel mechanistic insight to better develop and tailor cognitive interventions to target multiple chronic pain conditions."
"9481673","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The discovery of modulators of bone remodeling is crucial to developing new treatments for osteoporosis. The transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8, a.k.a the cold and menthol receptor) is a voltage-gated cation channel that is open below 26°C. Neural TRPM8 is important for cold sensation, cold pain and cold analgesia, and thermogenesis. However, a non-neuronal role for TRPM8 is beginning to emerge. Adult Trpm8- /- mice have reduced trabecular bone volume fraction in the vertebrae and to a lesser extent in the long bones. This could be due to suppressed bone formation and/or increased bone resorption. In vitro, we found no difference in Trpm8-/- osteoclast differentiation compared to wildtype. Alternately, Trpm8-/- bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and calvarial osteoblasts (OB) have reduced differentiation. Consistent with the in vivo phenotype of reduced bone marrow adiposity, BMSCs and ear MSCs (eMSCs) fail to fully differentiate into adipocytes in vitro. This novel finding demonstrates there is a significant defect in differentiation into eiter OBs or adipocytes. However, the majority of TRPM8 expression in vivo is on sensory neurons and we have evidence that neurons expressing TRPM8 are present in the bone marrow cavity. These could influence osteoblasts through paracrine pathways. My overarching hypotheses are that TRPM8 supports osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation through its direct expression in MSC-derived precursors (Aim 1) and that neural TRPM8 supports osteoblast differentiation through paracrine mechanisms (Aim 2). Finally, I will utilize novel Trpm8fl/fl mice to selectively delete Trpm8 in mesenchymal cells versus sensory neurons (Aim 3), where I will be able to delineate the extent to which each cell type contributes to the reduced bone mass phenotype. SPECIFIC AIM 1: In this aim, I will test the hypothesis that TRPM8 signaling in mesenchymal cells activates PKA to promote adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation utilizing shRNA and calcium flux analyses. SPECIFIC AIM 2: Despite striking in vitro differences in MSC differentiation in the absence of TRPM8, the majority of TRPM8 expression in vivo is on sensory neurons. Aim 2a: Test the hypothesis that sensory neurons expressing TRPM8 are present in bone. Aim 2b: Test the hypothesis that TRPM8 activation in sensory neurons supports osteoblast differentiation through dendrite:osteoblast contact. SPECIFIC AIM 3: Trpm8fl/fl mice will be crossed with SynapsinCre/+ and Prrx1Cre/+ mice to test whether effects of in vivo Trpm8 deletion are mediated through neural or osteoblast TRPM8 expression, respectively. The proposed experiments will identify mechanisms though which TRPM8 regulates osteoblast and adipocyte lineage, generate novel data on neural- mesenchymal cell interactions, and set forth a foundation for future work examining sensory neuron control of bone remodeling."
"9537707","We have identified two independent ENU-induced mouse mutations in the nuclear export mediating factor (Nemf) causing a motor neuron disease with many phenotypic hallmarks of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). NEMF has recently been shown to be a key component of the stalled-ribosome quality control complex (RQC) that allows for ubiquitination, C-terminal addition of poly Ala/Thr tails (CAT-tails) and disposal of ribosome-stalled nascent polypeptide chains. Co-PI Joazeiro has previously characterized a mouse model of neurodegeneration caused by ENU mutation of another RQC complex member, Listerin (Ltn1). In several ways, the Ltn1-ENU phenotype resembles that of other mouse models of ALS including the newly discovered Nemf mouse models, thus solidifying the connection between RQC dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Preliminary work has identified human sporadic ALS patients with rare and potentially damaging NEMF polymorphisms. Thus, the identification of the novel NEMF mouse model provides a key resource for determining how defects in protein quality control mechanisms may lead to neurological disease. We hypothesize that misregulated ribosomal quality control can underlie motor neuron disease, and that NEMF is a putative new ALS-associated disease gene critical for regulating normal neuronal function. !"
"9467150","PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT The goal of the current Phase I project is to develop (to clinical trial readiness) and evaluate feasibility of a mobile ecological momentary intervention designed to improve social functioning in individuals with schizophrenia. While effective treatments such as group-based social skills training and computerized social cognition training are known to induce positive effects on lab-based measures of social, community and occupational functioning, no approaches currently monitor and facilitate the generalization of acquired skills in real-world settings. Mobile technology offers many advantages over clinic-based approaches, in that it enables real-time evaluation, interaction, and support within the individual's natural environment, thus facilitating skill transfer. Additionally, it improves access, expands reach, and targets underserved vulnerable individuals who are unable to access these specialized programs. In our preliminary work, we developed and demonstrated the feasibility of a newly designed mobile psychosocial intervention called CLIMB (Creating Live Interactions to Mitigate Barriers). CLIMB integrates computerized social cognition training with optimized remote social skills training, and is delivered entirely remotely using mobile platforms. Our preliminary data suggest that CLIMB resulted in good retention, engagement, and acceptability rates, and remediated social cognitive and quality of life impairments. In this proposal, we will first implement the current intervention with innovative features, including ecological momentary assessments, weekly self-reports, interactive training and evaluation modules, and a clinician dashboard. Next, we will evaluate the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the revised intervention with the target population. At the completion of this project we will have outcomes data sufficient to support a large scale randomized controlled trial in Phase II (medical device trial) designed to establish medical claims defining the efficacy of this intervention to enhance social functioning for schizophrenia. At the completion of Phase II, we expect to be able to complete the FDA regulatory pathway, clear the program as the first technology- based medical device intended for the enhancement of social functioning in schizophrenia, and have the opportunity to improve the lives of millions of people suffering from this condition."
"9477364","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the role of small non-coding RNAs, termed microRNAs (miRs), in the regulation of sodium (Na+) transport in the distal kidney nephron. We will investigate the hypothesis that the mineralocorticoid hormone, aldosterone regulates the expression of specific miR clusters in the distal kidney nephron cortical collecting duct (CCD), to alter Na+ transport by targeting the expression of the scaffold protein intersectin-2. Using in vivo mouse models we will establish the regulation of miRs in the principal cells of the CCD. The significantly regulated miRs that are altered by aldosterone and other signaling pathways linked to sodium regulation will be determined. We will alter the expression of the miR-23~24~27 clusters to demonstrate its importance in maintaining sodium balance in the kidney. Finally the mechanism of intersectin-2 regulation of the epithelial sodium channel will be determined, to characterize the involvement of this novel aldosterone-repressed protein in Na+ regulation in the kidney."
"9418599","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials."
"9504611","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for the SUNY College of Optometry to serve as a clinical center for the Convergence  Insufficiency Treatment Trial - Attention and Reading Trial (CITT-ART), a multicenter randomized, placebo  controlled, clinical trial designed to evaluate the effects of treatment for symptomatic convergence  insufficiency (CI) on measures of reading performance and attention in children.  In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic CI will be randomly assigned to 16 weeks of: 1) office-based vergence/ accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy. After 16 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome measures of reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-111]) reading comprehension subtest score and attention (Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]) will be assessed by examiners masked to treatment group. The Gates l\/lacGinitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Reading fluency, another test of attention, the CI Symptom Survey, and clinical measures of CI (i.e., the near point of convergence, and positive fusional vergence at near) are other secondary outcome measures; also included are assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading comprehension including pseudo word decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension. Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention are assessed 1-year post treatment.  This application documents our site's ability to recruit at least 36 subjects and to retain them for 1 year after completion of treatment. Documentation is provided that our site has the appropriate personnel, equipment, and facilities to conduct the study in accordance with the CITT-ART Manual of Procedures (MOP). Complete details of the study rationale, design, and methods are contained in the Manual of Procedures (submitted with the Study Chair and Data Coordinating Center [DCC] applications). In addition to our center, there are 8 other optometric or ophthalmologic centers, the Study Chair at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, and the DCC at The Ohio State University Optometry. Symptomatic CI is a common vision disorder in children that is commonly associated with symptoms while reading (e.g. loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading slowly, and trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of CI treatment on reading and attention is unknown. The results of the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and have important implications for educators, psychologists, and physicians who care for children with reading and attention problems. The findings will guide hypothesis development for future scientific investigations in children with vision disorders."
"9511518","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a lack of research on systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multisystem, chronic, autoimmune disease that shows clear patterns along racial and gender lines. African American women not only have a greater prevalence of SLE, but also experience greater severity and faster progression compared to their White counterparts, being more frequently affected by organ damage and comorbid conditions that emerge as a consequence of disease activity and disease-related chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Racial disparities in SLE complications and mortality are well documented; however, the reasons for these disparities are poorly understood. To address these gaps in knowledge, this study aims to: (1) examine the role that psychosocial stressors experienced by African American women have in exacerbating SLE in this population; (2) identify social factors and psychological resources that are protective or buffer the effects of stress on SLE-related health declines; and (3) explore the biological implications of psychosocial stressors and SLE, in relation to elevated systemic inflammation and accelerated aging at the cellular level.  The experiences of African American women with SLE are particularly challenging, and include psychosocial stressors related to disease management, as well as disproportionately greater poverty and living in disadvantaged communities; in addition to routine stressors such as those associated with work, family and relationship demands, parenting, and caregiving. Experiences of racial discrimination constitute a qualitatively distinct source of psychosocial stress, adding o existing everyday hassles. In this study, we will examine how these stressors impact SLE severity and progression through a longitudinal study design. We will collect three waves of data from 480 African American women, all with validated SLE. Participants will be recruited from the Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) cohort, a truly one-of-a-kind, population-based study of SLE in Atlanta, including a full spectrum of patients from all levels of socioeconomic strata, across a range of disease severity. We will examine the effects of racial discrimination, financial and neighborhood-related strains, and other stressors associated with various role strains. Potential protective factors, including those related to racial identity and social suppor will also be assessed. We will collect dried blood spots (DBS), a minimally invasive alternative to venipuncture, to examine indicators of biological dysregulation which we hypothesize will be impacted by psychosocial stress as well as SLE activity. This study will be the most in-depth investigation of the multifactorial nature of psychosocial stressors and their impact on SLE disease progression among African American women, and thus fills an important gap in the science on this understudied disease. This research is important in advancing knowledge of how aspects of the social environment and psychological processes impact health among African American women with SLE, and also contributes to scientific knowledge on the underpinnings of racial disparities in the progression of this disease."

"9500910","ABSTRACT ! Recent advances to decode the genetics underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have led to the discovery of numerous IBD-associated genetic variants in the human genome. Our work studying these variants using genomics, mouse models, systems biology, and human patient samples has revealed the central role of autophagy and intracellular antimicrobial defense in the pathogenesis of IBD. In particular, characterization of IBD-associated I231L variant in the G protein-coupled receptor GPR65 revealed a key role of GPR65 as an environmental sensor that maintains lysosomal pH and function. Regulatory mechanisms that maintain lysosome homeostasis are critical in phagocytes such as macrophages, which require a highly developed lysosome network for delivery of microbicidal machinery to the phagosome. Recently, we have found that GPR65 interacts with the transcription factor, TFEB, that controls lysosome biogenesis. Here, we investigate the mechanisms by which GPR65 acts as a sensor, interpreting environmental cues and eliciting adaptive responses to maintain lysosomal homeostasis through TFEB. In Aim 1, we examine the role of GPR65 in controlling lysosome homeostasis through signaling intermediates and TFEB transcriptional activity. In Aim 2, we investigate the mechanisms by which impaired GPR65 signaling, and particularly the GPR65 I231L variant, results in colitis and pathogen susceptibility. In Aim 3, we will define how endogenous metabolites regulate TFEB activity. These research aims will advance our understanding of how metabolic sensors and lysosomal homeostasis mediate intracellular pathogen defense and could reveal a widespread role for lysosome biology in innate immunity."
"9696305","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  To achieve optimal health outcomes for persons living with HIV, several steps along the HIV treatment continuum -- diagnosis, linkage to care, retention in care, use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and viral suppression -- must be fulfilled. This project, Cooperative Agreement Re-Engagement Controlled Trial (CoRECT) seeks to demonstrate a cost-effective model for improving retention in HIV medical care through Health Department-lead outreach efforts for persons who have fallen out of care. This model could be adopted by Health Departments throughout the United States as a public health program to improve HIV care and reduce HIV transmission. The Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH) will demonstrate over a 5-year period the feasibility of an active care re-engagement intervention jointly implemented by PDPH and six collaborating HIV clinics in the City of Philadelphia which include Ryan White-funded, private, FQHC (Federally Qualified Health Center), and Veterans Administration settings. Patients identified as recently out of care through combined clinic and HIV surveillance data will be randomized to either an active re-engagement intervention from the Health Department or standard of care clinic follow-up. An estimated 600 out of care patients will be identified (300 per arm) from among nearly 5,000 total HIV patients of the collaborating clinics. The primary outcome for CoRECT will evaluate whether patients in the active intervention arm are more likely to achieve viral load suppression within 12 months of the study intervention compared with those receiving usual services. The study's methods are innovative in its planned use of surveillance data, patient-level clinical data, and locating databases to develop rosters of out of care HIV-positive patients. In the active re- engagement arm, Health Department staff will locate clients lost to care and provide intensive re-engagement services. Standard of care clinic-level linkage and engagement services will be provided to all patients and include reminder calls to patients prior to their scheduled appointments, active follow up after missed appointments (i.e. phone calls, letters, etc.). Participating clinics must accept same-day or walk-in appointments referred from the Health Department through the intervention arm. Philadelphia will be one of three project areas conducting the CoRECT study. Philadelphia is the sixth most populous city in the US with an estimated HIV infection rate of 1.3%. Of the 19,832 persons diagnosed with HIV living in Philadelphia, an estimated 54% are not receiving regular HIV medical care. PDPH has developed a comprehensive HIV program to address the epidemic and high quality HIV surveillance, clinical care and partner services are highly coordinated both within the Health Department and in a continuum of contracted provider agencies. PDPH has successfully implemented similar projects and will implement CoRECT based on this experience. Findings from the project will be used in local HIV planning, submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals as well as professional meetings."
"9546353","Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) afflicts many men and women in both military and civilian populations. The early post-TBI period is characterized by neuroinflammation and oxidative stress followed by neurobehavioral changes that include sleep disturbances, neuroendocrine dysfunction, cognitive impairments, and behavioral impairments that include higher anxiety and depression, increased stress sensitivity, anhedonia, impulse control deficits, and higher pain sensitivity. All of these behavioral symptoms can promote escalated alcohol drinking in humans in an attempt to mitigate their symptoms, and this can eventually increase the likelihood of an alcohol use disorder (AUD) diagnosis. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying post-TBI escalation of alcohol drinking are not known. Critical from a healthcare burden perspective, our lab and others have shown that post-TBI alcohol exposure impairs recovery of neurobehavioral function, exacerbates gliosis, and prevents resolution of neuroinflammation. Preliminary data show increased glutamatergic signaling and synaptic hyperexcitability at the site of injury and in the basolateral amygdala, which we believe underlies previously observed post-TBI escalation of alcohol drinking and increased motivation to obtain alcohol. Moreover, our data show that a single post-injury administration of JZL184, a monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitor that prevents endocannabinoid degradation, attenuates neuroinflammation and improves neurobehavioral recovery post-TBI. In addition, JZL184 rescues excessive glutamatergic signaling and neuronal hyperexcitability at site of injury, and reduces motivation to obtain alcohol. Proposed studies will use male and female rats to test the hypothesis that synaptic hyperexcitability is associated with post-TBI increases in anxiety-like behavior and alcohol drinking. We predict that pharmacological (i.e., JZL184) and non-pharmacological (i.e., abstinence) therapeutic interventions will reduce post-TBI escalation of alcohol drinking and prevent post-TBI synaptic hyperexcitability in alcohol drinkers. Studies proposed will use an integrated experimental approach (behavior, immunohistochemistry, biochemistry, electrophysiology, pharmacology, and chemogenetics). An interdisciplinary team of investigators with established records of accomplishment on studies of TBI and inflammatory responses to alcohol (Molina); animal models of alcohol self-administration, dependence, and behavioral pharmacology (Gilpin); biochemical signaling mechanisms of alcohol dependence (Edwards); and electrophysiological investigations of neuronal synaptic circuitry (Middleton) will conduct them. The overarching goal of this project is to determine whether preventing pathological post-TBI synaptic plasticity in amygdala prevents post-TBI escalation of alcohol drinking and improves post-TBI outcomes. Studies will be supported by the outstanding scientific environment and Core analytical facilities supported by the NIAAA-funded LSUHSC Comprehensive Alcohol Research Center."
"9654805","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Robust systems to consent, screen, return results, and to evaluate processes and outcomes of incorporating genomic risk information in clinical care for common chronic diseases are missing and urgently needed. We propose that hypertension-associated CKD in African ancestry communities has emerged as a highly relevant and well-suited opportunity for a 'prototype' genomic medicine demonstration project that addresses common chronic illnesses managed in primary care settings. African ancestry populations with hypertension (HTN) have 2- to 3-fold higher risk of developing CKD, and a 5-fold increased risk to progress to end stage renal disease (ESRD) when compared with whites. Recent discoveries demonstrate that testable alleles of the APOL1 locus on chromosome 22 have a major effect on and explain almost all of the excess risk for hypertension-associated CKD and its progression to ESRD in African ancestry populations. In this genomic medicine demonstration pilot project, we plan to implement a cluster randomized trial at primary care facilities of a network of community health centers in Harlem and the Bronx and at Mount Sinai Medical Center. The trial will test whether the desperately low probabilities of correct renal care i.e. appropriate ordering of tests to evaluate CKD and CKD progression, appropriate prescription of renoprotective renin angiotensin blockade, appropriate control of blood pressure in hypertensive patients with albuminuria of African ancestry, will be improved significantly in those facilities that receive EMR-enabled renal care CDS incorporating APOL1 genomic risk information compared with those facilities that receive renal care CDS based on conventional risk information only.  The project will have three Specific Aims: 1) Understand knowledge, attitudes, beliefs about testing for APOL1, returning results, and engaging people of African ancestry and their clinicians into a process of testing, counseling and appropriate clinical care. 2) Develop systems and evidence-based advice messages to enable point of care Clinical Decision Support (CDS) for primary care providers advising renal care practice guidelines with our without genomic APOL1 risk information. 3) Conduct a cluster randomized trial assigning eight distinct primary care facilities to receive either renal care CDS with APOL1 genomic risk information (GENOMIC RENAL CARE FACILITY) or with conventional risk information (CONVENTIONAL RENAL CARE FACILITY) to guide primary care for non-diabetic African Americans with hypertension. In the long-term, the proposed genomic medicine demonstration pilot project is expected to generate essential new insights for sustainable adoption and large-scale dissemination of genomic medicine in diverse clinical settings providing care for common adult-onset diseases in general, and for underserved African Ancestry populations with large excess burden of non-diabetic kidney diseases specifically."
"9484342","Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor and has a median survival of less than 15 months, presenting an urgent clinical challenge. To overcome this challenge, our research has focused on Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP). MTAP deletion occurs in about half of GBM patients, suggesting any therapeutic strategy devised based on MTAP status will significantly impact the treatment landscape of this disease. Our preliminary study has demonstrated that MTAP deletion is associated with a worse clinical outcome. In studying the underlying mechanism, we have elucidated that the status of MTAP (presence or absence) affects GBM cells? DNA methylome and the expression of genes involved in GBM pathogenesis and in response to treatments. Furthermore, we have devised additional strategies of exploiting MTAP status for clinical benefit. Normally, MTAP functions in the salvage pathway for adenine and methionine. In MTAP-deficient tumor cells, the absence of this salvage pathway sensitizes cells to inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis, providing an opportunity to specifically target cancer cells. We have devised a novel purine starvation strategy that can effectively abrogate tumor growth. These exciting findings prompt us to further understand the molecular mechanism of MTAP deletion in GBM and refine the promising therapeutic approach we have developed. Our central hypothesis is that MTAP loss affects GBM progression via altering DNA methylation, and that MTAP deletion can be exploited for GBM treatment. Specific Aim 1: Determine the functional consequences of MTAP deletion in GBM. We will test the hypothesis that MTAP deletion affects GBM progression via altering cancer cells? DNA methylation patterns. Sub-Aim 1.1: Determine the mechanism underlying the effects of MTAP deletion on GBM cells; and Sub-Aim 1.2: Determine the clinical significance of MTAP deletion. Specific Aim 2: Develop a purine starvation-based therapeutic strategy for MTAP-null GBM. We will test the hypothesis that purine starvation can be an effective treatment for MTAP-null GBM. Sub-Aim 2.1: We will use xenograft models derived from primary GBM cultures and test their response to purine starvation; and Sub-Aim 2.2: We will determine the mechanism underlying GBM cells? response to purine starvation. This study will establish MTAP deletion as a direct therapeutic target in GBM, illuminate the mechanism underlying the consequences of MTAP deletion in GBM progression and response to treatment, generate novel in vitro and in vivo GBM models, and potentially lead to a new paradigm for clinical management of GBM."
"9544935","Uric acid (UA) is a terminal metabolite of the purine metabolic pathway in humans. Excess UA, the clinical disorder hyperuricemia, affects 43 million Americans causing gout and increasing risk for hypertension, stroke, metabolic syndrome, and chronic kidney disease. A genetic and physiological approach led to our identification of the multidrug transporter ABCG2 as a high capacity UA efflux transporter and that common ABCG2 variants make the largest genetic contribution to increased UA levels and gout risk. Although the genetic role of ABCG2 in hyperuricemia and gout risk is now well established, we know little of the physiological role of ABCG2 as a renal UA transporter. The process of UA homeostasis is by necessity a dynamic process as diet and metabolism produce highly variable UA loads. Thus, the overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a mechanistic explanation of how ABCG2 mediated renal UA excretion is physiologically regulated, and how dysfunction of the process leads to hyperuricemia and human disease. The AIMs of our proposal will address the following three questions: 1) Is ABCG2 physiologically regulated in vivo and a critical component of UA homeostasis? 2) What role does phosphorylation play in regulating ABCG2 and renal UA excretion? and 3) How does the common ABCG2 gout mutation Q141K alter ABCG2 regulation and the physiology of renal UA excretion? This work will provide a new understanding of the molecular mechanisms of urate homeostasis and illuminate both the consequences of dysregulated hyperuricemia on human health, and novel therapeutic targets for treatment."
"9476967","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related death in the United States. It is critically important to identify those at high risk for HCC and institute effective surveillance strategies for early diagnosis. Livr cirrhosis is the main risk factor for HCC. Ultrasound and ?-fetoprotein (AFP) every 6 months remains the surveillance modality most frequently used on cirrhosis patients but the sensitivity and specificity of the tests are low. Our extensive prior biomarker studies in HCC cases, cirrhosis controls and HCC pre-diagnosis samples identified novel markers for HCC risk prediction and surveillance. In this proposal, we will further evaluate the performance of these novel markers together with FDA-approved markers. The validation study will be performed in a large contrast MRI surveillance cohort that provides a unique opportunity to study biomarkers on clinical material from patients rigorously classified as having a very early disease in a surveillance setting. Longitudinal collection of blood samples will be particularly valuable in assessing how early biomarkers become positive during the period when lesions are observed to a confirmed diagnosis of HCC. Cirrhotic patients under contrast MRI surveillance (n=3500 patients) will be enrolled at Baylor-St. Luke's Medical Center and Houston Methodist Hospital. Data management, specimen repository and molecular assays will be performed at MD Anderson Cancer Center. It is anticipated that at least 150 HCCs will be detected during the study with most of them detected at an early stage. We will identify the panel of biomarkers that best distinguishes between early HCC and cirrhosis and that could therefore have utility in HCC surveillance. We will evaluate the capacity of the novel marker panel to detect preclinical disease and determine longitudinal changes in these biomarkers predictive of HCC development. Our prior studies also identified specific fatty acids that discriminate between patients with cirrhosis who developed HCC within 5 years and those who didn't progress to HCC. These fatty acids may therefore have utility in HCC risk assessment. We will determine using the same MRI surveillance cohort the fatty acid panel that best predicts HCC development. Finally, this study will evaluate the complementarity performance of ultrasound and the novel biomarker panel and determine whether contrast-enhanced ultrasound results in any significant improvement in the ability of ultrasound to detect small tumor foci. This proposal achieves in one study two major goals: early detection and characteristics of tumors when biomarker becomes positive. This study has a number of high-impact translational applications: spare patients from unnecessary imaging tests; identify at-risk patients and trigger the decision to perform MRI instead of ultrasound in patients under surveillance; detect lesions at an early stage allowing for curative treatment. Such clinical applications would significantly reduce the cost of HCC surveillance and improve survival of HCC patients."
"9541665","This project seeks to understand how mechanical forces shape cardiac development, and to use this knowledge to engineer human cardiac tissues with improved electromechanical function. I will combine two novel platforms, a protein-based nanomechanical biosensor for mapping in vivo tissue strain, and an iPSC- derived 3-D engineered cardiac tissue environment to evaluate tissue contractility and electrophysiology during tissue formation. In developing cardiac muscle, mechanical forces are integral to a range of processes including cell differentiation, tissue morphogenesis, electrophysiology and contractility, but exact roles remain unknown. When mechanical forces are perturbed by experimental intervention or developmental abnormalities, their disruption can lead to congenital heart defects and disease. With advances in regenerative medicine and the use of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) for tissue engineering, new approaches for repairing damaged heart tissue have emerged. However, there has been limited success bringing engineered cardiac systems to the clinic, and we remain far from generating an engineered heart. This suggests that the field lacks thorough understanding of the mechanical forces driving functional and structural maturation of engineered cardiac tissue. Here I propose that knowledge of the magnitudes, developmental timing, and directionality of cellular strain in developing cardiac tissue in vivo can be used to improve the construction of iPSC-derived 3-D engineered cardiac tissues, leading to increased tissue contractility and clinical utility. Aim 1 will elucidate the mechanical forces shaping cardiac tissue development via design, construction and experimental validation of a protein-based nanomechanical strain biosensor. Additionally, I will utilize this strain biosensor to map tissue strain throughout cardiac looping via in vivo and ex vivo Xenopus cardiac development models. Aim 2 will determine the biomechanical strains sufficient to improve human iPSC-derived cardiac tissue contractility and electrophysiology. By mapping the biomechanics of cardiac tissue development from Aim 1 and integrating the observed forces into the iPSC-derived 3-D cardiac tissue engineering process, I will determine the consequences of recapitulating in vivo strain fields on tissue structure, gene expression and contractility. While this proposal seeks to enhance our knowledge of biomechanical forces during tissue formation and improve engineered cardiac tissue models, the tools created will have wide utility in understanding the complex role between biomechanical forces and tissue development. By the end of the project, I will have developed and validated these technologies using coupled in vitro and in vivo systems, along with obtaining expertise in biomechanical and tissue engineering. Long-term, the knowledge gained should improve the engineering of human cardiac tissues for applications in heart regeneration."
"9455627","Abstract  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the US, in part due to the lack of effective therapies for advanced disease. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify molecules/pathways involved in oncogenic transformation and progression for cancer treatment.  LGR5 has been discovered as a proliferating adult stem cell marker in the small intestine. It has been reported that, after binding R-spondins, LGR5 forms a physical complex with the Wnt receptor Frizzled and its co-receptor LRP6 to amplify Wnt canonical signaling. In addition, LGR5 expression has been shown to be upregulated in colon cancer as compared to normal tissues. Therefore, LGR5 has been proposed to be a tumor promoter in the intestine and colon. However, our studies of patient samples indicate that although expression of LGR5 is higher in stage I/II adenocarcinomas than in normal crypts (* P < 0.05), its expression decreases in stage III/IV tumors as compared to stage I/II tumors (** P < 0.01). These results suggest that loss of LGR5 is associated with advanced stage cancer, which argues against a promoting role, especially at later stages. We showed that LGR5 inhibits clonogenecity and survival in colon cancer cells and that knockdown of LGR5 expression increases their metastatic potential in an orthotopic model. Mechanistically, LGR5 activates TGF? signaling, which occurs even in the absence of TGF? RII, and the presence of RII further enhances the activation by LGR5. In addition, LGR5 inhibits Wnt signaling in a Smad4-dependent manner. Our results point to a suppressive role of LGR5 in colon cancer progression/metastasis.  In this proposal, we will determine the mechanism(s) by which LGR5 activates TGF? signaling and inhibits Wnt activation. We will also determine the functional role of LGR5 in colon cancer development/progression using genetic mouse models, investigate whether restoration of LGR5 expression elicits metastasis regression and whether LGR5 functions through the activation of TGF??signaling and/or inhibition of Wnt signaling in an orthotopic mouse model and in patient specimens. The completion of these studies will identify RSPO/LGR5 /RI as a novel TGF? transduceome and a colon cancer metastasis suppressor and substantially advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of LGR5, an intestinal stem cell marker, in suppressing colon cancer progression and metastasis."
"9578793","ABSTRACT  Many bacterial pathogens attempt to adhere to or invade intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), often using virulence factors that manipulate cytosolic signaling pathways in the IEC. However, IECs are able to survey their cytosol by using innate immune sensors in the inflammasome family. We have shown that inflammasomes can detect the activity of bacterial secretion systems by detecting aberrant translocation of bacterial flagellin, rod, and needle proteins.  Inflammasomes have largely been studied in macrophages, where active caspase-1 was first shown to cleave pro-IL-1? and pro-IL-18 to their mature and released forms. Caspase-1 was recently shown to cleave a third protein, gasdermin D, which forms a pore in the plasma membrane that causes programmed lytic cell death, or pyroptosis. The function of caspase-1 in other cell types is now beginning to be studied, and these may be slightly different from its function in macrophages. In this regard, in IECs inflammasomes were recently shown to drive exfoliation of the compromised IEC, ejecting it into the gut lumen.  Caspase-1 is the founding member of the larger caspase family. Caspases are normally considered as either apoptotic or inflammatory, however in recent years many interactions across classes have been demonstrated. Here we examine how IECs are defended by caspase-1, but also that other normally apoptotic caspases are also involved in exfoliation. We will study the innate immune inflammasome sensors that drive exfoliation during bacterial infection, and also how different innate immune cells coordinate their activities to promote IEC exfoliation."
"9483456","ABSTRACT Circulating tumor cells drive metastasis when they travel from primary tumors to distant organs via the circulation. Multicellular clusters of circulating tumor cells though less frequently observed in blood, are much more likely to establish metastases than individual circulating tumor cells and the presence of tumor clusters in blood has been associated with dramatically worse prognoses in patients. Although there are many suspected explanations for their greater metastatic potentials, much is still unknown about the behavior of clusters, especially in the narrow vessels of the body. Recent evidence has demonstrated that cluster transiting through narrow constrictions experience dynamic changes to structure and organization. Forces in the microcirculation cause clusters to reversibly re-organize into single-file chains to enable transit through narrow capillary-sized vessels and nuclear envelopes are ruptured and rapidly repaired during migration events through narrow constrictions. Two biophysical parameters within clusters, cellular adhesion strengths and nuclear mechanics, are vital for these behaviors. Because of the important role that these parameters play in many aspects of metastatic progression, we hypothesize that these parameters modulate the biophysical responses of clusters to physical forces in the microcirculation, and that these interactions play a significant role in the competitive edge that clusters have edge over individual cancer cells for seeding metastases. To this end, we propose three specific aims. In aim 1, we will develop next generation models of the human microcirculation with rounded networks of endothelial cell coated microfluidic devices and geometry matched computational simulations. In aim 2, we will explore how intercellular adhesions affect the biophysical responses and metastasis-forming abilities of homogeneous versus heterogeneous clusters in the microcirculation through the use of our developed models. Finally, in aim 3 we will study the physical basis for nuclear envelope rupture, DNA-damage, genetic instability and other DNA-level affects that are involved in metastatic progression. Understanding the interplay between the biophysics and biology of clusters within the microcirculation will elucidate mechanisms that can be used to combat the progression of cluster-initiated metastases."
"9598095","Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), particularly those with activating KRAS mutations, are often unresponsive to targeted agents and have a poor prognosis. However, immunotherapeutic approaches, particularly PD-1/PD-L1 pathway blockade, have recently improved the treatment of these cancers, supporting the premise that evasion of immune destruction contributes to NSCLC pathogenesis. MUC1-C is an oncogenic protein that is overexpressed in >80% of NSCLCs and is linked to multiple immune signaling pathways. Work supported by this grant has demonstrated that EGFR mutant NSCLCs activate the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and increase production of proinflammatory cytokines. We have also shown that MUC1-C promotes (i) oncogenic signaling in NSCLCs via EGFR activation, and (ii) confers EMT, self-renewal and tumorigenicity in KRAS mutant NSCLCs. Based on these findings, we have generated novel antibodies against the non-shed MUC1-C extracellular domain and inhibitors of the cytoplasmic domain for therapeutic targeting of MUC1-C in NSCLC cells. Our preliminary observations indicate that targeting MUC1-C downregulates PD-L1 expression in EGFR and KRAS mutant NSCLC cells. We have also found that MUC1-C deficiency is associated with recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages and alterations in the infiltrating T-cell phenotype. Our hypothesis is that MUC1-C plays an important role in evading immune destruction, which will be addressed in studies of (i) human NSCLC cell lines, (ii) genetically engineered mouse models, and (iii) primary NSCLC tumors. The Specific Aims are: (1) To investigate the role of MUC1-C in PD-L1 pathway activation in EGFR and KRAS mutant NSCLC cells, (2) To define the role of MUC1-C in recruitment and function of macrophages and T-cells within the tumor microenvironment of KRAS and EGFR mutant NSCLC, (3) To evaluate the effects of targeting MUC1-C to circumvent immune evasion in mutant EGFR and KRAS NSCL tumors, and (4) To assess fresh resected/biopsied lung cancer specimens and correlate MUC1 expression with T-cell and other immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint gene expression, and cytokine secretion in the tumor microenvironment."
"9551659","ABSTRACT: BIOINFORMATICS CORE Current genetic and genomic technologies produce a large amount of data, and it is challenging to distinguish relevant from irrelevant genomic variants. There is a need for new, widely applicable, informatics methods that can integrate and interpret genome-scale information in the context of functional networks, thus providing insight into the specific molecular processes affected by mutations that drive human disease. This application is based on the hypothesis that [A] monogenic etiologies are responsible for CDH segregating in families, with varying degrees of penetrance, [B] de novo mutations with large effect sizes are responsible for a fraction of sporadic, mostly complex, CDH cases, and [C] rare risk variants contributing to CDH can be discovered in genetic data from singletons. Statistical genetics will inform our discovery of causative variants, for example by burden tests for de novo variants compared against a large control group of sequenced normal children ascertained from the unaffected siblings of children with sporadic autism, and made publicly available as the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). For this purpose, we have adapted analysis pipelines to identify and annotate variants, incorporating appropriate bioinformatics tools. Innovative network analyses based on Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) and gene co-expression are an essential complement to genetic studies of variants in humans with rare diseases such as CDH (Project I) and their optimal selection for analyses in model organisms (Projects II and III). Here we detail some of the specific tools, methods, and approaches the core will provide to interrogate various large data sets to be collected throughout the duration of the project."

"9537712","7. Project Summary/Abstract Numerous studies have consistently shown a remarkably large change in the transcriptome across sleep/wake states. Our preliminary evidence based on RNAseq technology suggests more than 2800 genes are differentially expressed in recovery sleep in response to four hours of sleep deprivation, compared to control conditions. These DEG's are enriched for genes related to synaptic function and for targets of a transcription factor, myocyte enhancing factor 2 (MEF2C), that controls synaptic strength. A leading proposal for the function of sleep posits an overall buildup of cortical synaptic strength during waking experience and a decrease of synaptic strength during ensuing sleep. Expression of the active form of Mef2 decreases synaptic strength. Our preliminary evidence suggests that four hours of sleep deprivation increases the MEF2 (the active form) to pMEF2 (the repressive form) ratio. This has lead us to the hypothesis that sleep- need modulates the activity of the transcription factor, MEF2C, to alter the expression of downstream mRNA to reduce glutamate synapse strength on forebrain cortical glutamate neurons. We plan to test this hypothesis by first establishing the differential transcriptome expression across behavioral state conditions in wildtype mice and then to compare it across these same conditions to the expression in conditional Mef2c knockout mutants (the ko will be restricted to glutamate forebrain neurons). We plan to characterize a sleep need/resolution phenotype in the Mef2c mutant using three indices of sleep need. Mutants and wildtype controls will be examined under baseline and sleep deprivation (SD) conditions. Our preliminary evidence shows that the homeostatic sleep response is lost in the mutants. The phosphorylation state of MEF2 determines its activity so we will assess the phosphorylation state of MEF2 in correlation with behavioral state condition. Additionally, since high noradrenergic activity can cause cleavage of the N-terminal of HDAC4 to inhibit MEF2 transcriptional activity, we will assess this N-terminal product across sleep wake states as well. We will characterize sleep-related, Mef2 dependent structural and functional changes of synapses, including morphologically defined spine number, dendritic structure and mEPSC frequency and amplitude recorded from layer 2-3 & 5-6 pyramidal neurons, in frontal cortical lobe (the anterior cingulate) in vitro. This proposal will provide one of the first comprehensive RNAseq based analyses across sleep/wake states that we be a useful resource for investigators to aid in the investigation and understanding of the large transcriptomic change that takes place in response to prolonged waking. It can provide an essential starting point for the identification of sleep related cell autonomous signaling cascades and molecular targets, important to brain health."
"9514306","Project Summary Title: Dual mechanism thiopeptide analogs for TB drug development Tuberculosis (TB) is a global pandemic: 10.4 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from TB in 2015. The TB health crisis is compounded by the rise in multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant (MDR and XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of TB. There is an urgent need to develop new drugs with novel mechanisms of action and improved efficacy. Thiopeptides are natural products discovered to have anti-Mtb activity over 60 years ago. Thiopeptides have potent activity and they act by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis through a novel mechanism that avoids cross-resistance with other antibiotics. However, because thiopeptides manifest extremely poor aqueous solubility, their development as anti-TB drugs was abandoned long ago. Recent data shows thiopeptides to also be able to induce autophagy in macrophages. Because autophagy can serve as a host defense to eliminate intracellular pathogens, such as Mtb, this thiopeptide activity could enhance host antimicrobial mechanisms (i.e. serve as a host directed therapeutic) to supplement the direct anti-Mtb effects of thiopeptides. Such a dual mode of action of a single compound (bacterial and host effects) has the exciting potential to provide two therapeutic effects with one drug. In this R21, we will revisit the therapeutic potential of thiopeptides. In Aim 1, we will use our innovative chemoenzymatic approach to thiopeptide synthesis to produce non-natural thiopeptide analogs with improved aqueous solubility. Analogs will be tested for activity against Mtb in vitro and for autophagy inducing activity on macrophages. Quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling will inform subsequent rounds of synthesis and improvement. In Aim 2, we will test the most tractable compounds for efficacy on Mtb infected macrophages and assess the contribution of the dual mechanisms of action to thiopeptide control of intracellular Mtb. The outcome of the proposed Aims, will be the identification of thiopeptide analogs with improved solubility, anti-Mtb activity and host directed activity that can serve as lead compounds for future preclinical testing in animal models. This study will advance ongoing efforts to develop new TB drugs with novel mechanisms of action, including host directed effects that could synergize with standard antibacterials. Because thiopeptides are also effective on several Gram-positive pathogens, our results may have additional implications for a wider array of infectious diseases."
"9454499","Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability, and motor impairment is the most common deficit post-stroke. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) shows promise in modulating cortical excitability to improve motor outcome in stroke patients. However, several questions about the parameters of this technique remain unclear, including the optimal current level and electrode montage for stroke patients. Determining these parameters is an important prerequisite for developing a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of this technique. This proposal aims to optimize these two parameters. We will first determine the optimal current between 1 mA to 4mA that balances the increase in cortical excitability and safety/tolerability. Once the optimal current level is determined, we will test 3 different types of electrode montages at that level to determine the optimal electrode montage that induces the maximal cortical excitability on the lesional motor cortex: 1) Anodal stimulation on the lesional motor cortex 2) Cathodal stimulation on the non-lesional motor cortex 3) Bi-hemispheric stimulation with anodal stimulation on the lesional motor cortex and cathodal stimulation on the non-lesional motor cortex This proposal serves as an important bridging step between the applicant's prior training and his next milestone - a Phase II single-center clinical trial (ROI application) to assess the efficacy of tDCS for stroke motor recovery utilizing the optimal current and stimulation montage determined by this proposal."
"9462855","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art deep learning models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner."

"9475879","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this career development award is to interrogate the relationship between prenatal stress, placental microbes, intrauterine inflammation and growth factors, and investigate their influence on the development of aberrant behavior in exposed offspring. The proposal is designed to facilitate the career development and transition to independence of Tamar L. Gur, M.D., Ph.D., a board certified, practicing psychiatrist, specializing in the treatment of perinatal depression and anxiety. At the conclusion of the award, Dr. Gur will be an independent investigator, leading a transdisciplinary research laboratory that will make substantial contributions to the understanding of the influence of prenatal stress on psychiatric disorders in offspring, by probing the interplay between stress, microbes, inflammation and growth factors in the intrauterine environment, using innovative methods. Dr. Gur will gain this expertise through the combined guidance of her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Bailey, PhD, a leader in stress and the microbiome, and co-mentor, Dr. Irina Buhimschi, MD, an expert in the molecular mechanisms underlying pathophysiology in pregnancy, and mouse models of pregnancy. Prenatal stress is a known contributor to the emergence of psychiatric illness in the offspring. The proposed research will examine basic mechanisms underlying the contribution of prenatal stress to psychiatric disorders by investigating the function of placental microbes, and to determine how alterations in these microbes contributes to inflammation and regulation of growth factors in the intrauterine environment. Dr. Gur has established a mouse model of prenatal stress, which induces alterations in placental microbes and concomitant changes in inflammation and brain derived neurotrophic factor in utero, resulting in increased anxiety and cognitive changes in females, decreased social behavior in males, and longstanding changes in microbiome in both sexes. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that prenatal stress alters microbes in utero. Our hypothesis is that dysbiosis in the placenta alters inflammation and BDNF, impacting the developing central nervous system, resulting in long-term microbiome and behavioral changes in the offspring. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing these aims: 1) Determine whether placental microbes are viable, their origin, and, utilizing a germ-free mouse model, whether they are sufficient to induce behavioral changes; 2) Determine whether maternal stress is associated with immune dysregulation in the intrauterine environment; 3) Determine how stress-induced changes in microbiota alter BDNF in utero. Dr. Gur has assembled an outstanding team of mentors, including pioneers in stress and inflammation, and microbiome and health. The extensive resources of the Ohio State University and deep commitment and support of her Department and Institute, together with her formal plan for didactics in statistics, will further support Dr. Gur's goal of elucidating the mechanisms underlying the impact of prenatal stress on the developing offspring."
"9540885","Project Summary/Abstract: The proposed project is a high-risk, high-impact effort to achieve the early steps demonstrating the use of low-temperature corona discharge generated inside the cardiovascular system as a less-invasive treatment of infectious bacterial biofilm growths on native tissue and implanted medical devices. The long-term impact of the successful project is the less-invasive treatment of biofilm infections such as infective endocarditis (IE), which has a 30% mortality rate at 1 year, through a catheterized low-temperature plasma (LTP) device to produce localized doses of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the vicinity of the bacterial colony. ROS produced through gas-phase LTP has been demonstrated to destroy bacteria associated with IE, including staphylococcus aureus, as well as bacterial biofilms. This is part of an exciting, emerging field known as plasma medicine, which, to date, is focused on external and in-vitro applications. This project will open up a new and rich area of investigation for plasma medicine, internal plasma medicine, which has the potential to impact a wide range of disease states in the human body through less invasive means than surgery or systemic drugs. The project consists of three Specific Aims to evaluate the effect of LTP generation in blood, the effects on bacterial cultures in the vicinity, and the miniaturization of the LTP system for future integration with catheters. The first Aim is to determine the effect of LTP generation in human whole blood on the blood constituents' structure and function and measurement of ROS generation in the liquid part of the blood. The second Aim applies the most favorable LTP conditions to bacterial cultures (S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae) in a blood environment and evaluates the destructive effects of the ROS generation on unprotected cultures and biofilm specimens. The third Aim will demonstrate the potential for future translation of these devices to clinical practice by miniaturizing them to fit on the end of a catheter. Successful completion of this project will open the door to wider investigations under the R01 mechanism of the effect of LTP generation on healthy adjacent tissue, understanding the transport of LTP-generated ROS in the cardiovascular system, and investigations of other internal disease states."
"9503732","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal is for the Akron Children's Hospital to serve as a clinical center for the Convergence  Insufficiency Treatment Trial - Attention and Reading Trial (CITT-ART), a multicenter randomized, placebo  controlled, clinical trial designed to evaluate the effects of treatment for symptomatic convergence  insufficiency (Cl) on measures of reading performance and attention in children.  In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic Cl will be randomly assigned to 16 weeks of: 1) office-based vergence/ accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy. After 16 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome measures of reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-III] reading comprehension subtest score) and attention (Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]) will be assessed by examiners masked to treatment group. The Gates MacGinitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Reading fluency, another test of attention, the 01 Symptom Survey, and clinical measures of 01 (i.e., the near point of convergence, and positive fusional vergence at near) are other secondary outcome measures; also included are assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading comprehension including pseudo word decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension. Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention are assessed 1-year post treatment.  This application documents our site's ability to recruit at least 36 subjects and to retain them for 1 year after completion of treatment. Documentation is provided that our site has the appropriate personnel, equipment, and facilities to conduct the study in accordance with the OITT-ART Manual of Procedures (MOP). Complete details of the study rationale, design, and methods are contained in the Manual of Procedures (submitted with the Study Chair and Data Coordinating Center [DOO] applications). In addition to our center, there are 8 other optometric or ophthalmologic centers, the Study Chair at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, and the DOO at The Ohio State University Optometry Coordinating Center.  Symptomatic Cl is a common vision disorder in children that is commonly associated with symptoms while reading (e.g.; loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading slowly, and trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of Cl treatment on reading and attention is unknown. The results of the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and-have important implications for educators, psychologists, and physicians who care for children with reading and attention problems. The findings will guide hypothesis development for future scientific investigations in children with vision disorders."
"9518164","Project Summary This proposal addresses Provocative Question 1 ?What molecular mechanisms influence disease penetrance in individuals who inherit a cancer susceptibility gene?? Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a rare, inherited disorder that leads to a higher risk of breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, brain tumor (including glioma), adrenal cortical carcinoma, and other cancers. TP53, encoding the p53 tumor suppressor, is mutated in ~75% of LFS families. TP53 mutations in LFS patients occur in the coding sequence (CDS) and produce mutant p53 proteins that lack most or all normal tumor-suppressive functions and often confer oncogenic properties. Beyond LFS mutants, over 200 naturally occurring germline mutants of TP53 are known, yet only a few of them cause measurable perturbation of p53 function. Recent reports demonstrate that a single nucleotide polymorphism in a TP53 noncoding region predisposes carriers to multiple types of cancer including glioma, neuroblastoma, skin basal cell carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, and colorectal adenoma. As such, cancer susceptibility of this p53 noncoding mutant does not strictly mirror that of p53 germline mutations in LFS patients. Specifically, this noncoding mutant confers no increased risk of breast cancer, the most common LFS tumor, whereas it shares similarity with LFS mutants in glioma predisposition. This p53 mutant is positioned uniquely among known cancer-susceptibility alleles in that it is noncoding and present at higher frequency (~1 in 50 in general populations, i.e., over 6 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide carry this mutant). We hypothesize that the moderate reduction of p53 activity by the noncoding mutant predisposes carriers to glioma but not breast cancer. In this study, we will employ mouse models and cell lines to ascertain the causative role of this p53 noncoding mutant in cancer by comparing it with an LFS coding sequence mutant. In Aim 1, we will determine whether the p53 mutant increases glioma development in mice. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of this mutant in mammary tumor development in mice and in human breast epithelial cell transformation. In Aim 3, we will dissect the mechanisms of the p53 PAS mutant in tumorigenesis in comparison with an LFS mutant using mammary stem cells and neural stem cells. Data generated from this study will reveal the biological and pathologic function of p53 germline mutants beyond its established role in LFS. This project has potentially broad and far-reaching significance in that our findings will reveal mechanistic causal connections between germline variation and tissue-specific cancer penetrance."
"9516210","Project Summary Most organisms have an internal circadian timing system that organizes physiological and behavioral processes with respect to one another and the external environment to maximize organismal fitness. In modern society, many people live in conflict with the dictates of their internal clock, and this circadian dysregulation is associated with increased incidence of cancer, metabolic disease, mood disorders, cardiovascular disease and cognitive deficits. The circadian system is made up of central clock cells in the brain, input pathways that synchronize the clock to external environmental cues, and output pathways that couple the clock to overt physiological and behavioral processes. The output pathways are the least understood aspect of circadian rhythms; thus, identification of the cells and molecules that make up output pathways is of outstanding interest. To that end, we recently showed that the Drosophila pars intercerebralis (PI) is a major component of the circadian output pathway controlling rest:activity rhythms. In this proposal we will extend on those findings to further delineate the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which circadian information is transmitted across output pathways to control behavior. In Aim 1a, we will induce PI- specific knockdown of genes isolated through single-cell transcriptome analysis of PI cells to identify novel circadian output molecules. In preliminary experiments, we identified the slowpoke potassium channel as a regulator of rest:activity rhythms, and in Aim 1b, we will use ex vivo calcium imaging to test the hypothesis that slowpoke contributes to the transmission of circadian information by producing rhythms of PI neuron excitability. In Aims 2-3, we will investigate how a single central clock regulates multiple circadian outputs through the use of a newly-developed assay that for the first time allows for extended, uninterrupted analysis of feeding behavior. In Aim 2, we will induce genetic manipulations that excite, inhibit, or ablate specific molecularly-defined subsets of PI cells to test the hypothesis that control of feeding and rest:activity rhythms diverges at the level of the PI output cell. In Aim 3, we will perform genetic manipulations that selectively alter circadian clock speed in the brain or fat body, a peripheral clock tissue that is functionally equivalent to the mammalian liver and adipose, to investigate the relative contribution of central and peripheral clocks to behavioral outputs. Together, these experiments will identify genes that contribute to circadian outputs, map the action of these genes to specific cellular components of the output pathway, determine how the central clock controls distinct behavioral outputs, and assess how central and peripheral clocks coordinately modulate behavior. This will address several longstanding questions in the field and contribute to our understanding of the negative consequences of circadian disruption."
"9620725","Project Summary The detailed mechanisms of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) assembly constitute a significant gap in our understanding of the infection cycle of this devastating pathogen. Specifically, the mechanisms by which the essential Envelope (Env) glycoprotein and structural Gag molecule efficiently coalesce to form an infectious HIV-1 particle are poorly understood, due to our inability to quantitatively measure the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual molecules at the nanoscale within infected host cells. This proposal aims to delineate the underpinnings of HIV-1 assembly on a single molecule basis and in a native cellular context. To accomplish these aims, we propose to utilize superresolution microscopy to visualize and quantify the stages of virus assembly in order to determine the role of key peptide motifs found in HIV-1 Env and Gag. Our preliminary data and analytics demonstrate our ability to quantitatively map the biogenesis of HIV-1 and strongly suggest that this approach will provide unequivocal insight in the mechanisms of particle assembly. These discoveries will provide new quantitative models to guide approaches aimed at thwarting HIV-1 assembly."

"9481312","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A collection of diverse and highly accurate primate genomes are critical to further our understanding of human variation and the evolutionary context of genetic disease. The main goal of this proposal is to generate high quality reference genomes that better represent the complexity of human diversity (i.e., continental human reference genomes) and that significantly improve the quality of index non-human primate (NHP) genomes, reaching a quality level more in line with the current human genome (GRCh38). We have selected 8 human genomes and 8 NHP for de novo sequencing and assembly using single molecule real-time sequencing followed by extensive higher-level resolution using experimental approaches. The end-result will be a set of NHP genomes that represent a >10-20 fold improvement in assembly continuity and representation of each and human genomes where >95% of euchromatic unique regions are fully sequenced, annotated, and phased. This project includes a special emphasis on gaps and gene-rich complex sequence structure, which have been the most intractable euchromatic regions of primate genomes. While there are many metrics of genome assembly completion and sequencing, ours is a practical one. The goal of this project is complete euchromatic sequence where >95% of the bases are ordered and oriented, and >95% of gene models are complete and annotated. Assemblies based on improved genome scaffolding or simple phasing of short read data using synthetic long reads add value but do not meet the needs of most researchers who are interested in studying gene models, gene regulation, and genetic variation. The community requires that sequence gaps are resolved and each genome is assembled at high contiguity. Our strategy is to deliver quality over quantity, and as such we are focused on a smaller subset of genomes delivered at the highest quality, building upon very recent advances in sequencing technology and assembly."
"9456708","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The vocal fold lamina propria extracellular matrix (ECM) is critical to vocal quality, but its poor healing ability and limitations of surgical repairhave motivated cell based strategies to engineer living tissue replacement. Paucity of human vocal fold fibroblasts (VFF) has necessitated the pursuit of surrogate cells that can be exploited alone, in combination with scaffolds and/or growth factors for optimal therapeutic application. The long-term goal of our research program is to engineer products that induce tissue regeneration for treatment vocal fold scarring and other ECM defects of the lamina propria. The overall objective of this competitive renewal application, which is a necessary step towards achieving our long term goal, is to identify and define vocal fold lamina propria pre-natal chemical and mechanical cues as well as their optimal combination that will be able to regulate guided differentiation of stem cells. Our working hypothesize is that knowledge of the embryonic microenvironment (biomechanical and biochemical composition) and its contributors (growth factors and mechanical loads) will provide VFF differentiation criterion and a unique set of tissue engineering design parameters that can guide candidate cell differentiation towards regeneration of new, normal tissue. In specific aim 1 we will identify and define dynamic gene expression signatures and lineages in the murine vocal fold as it progresses through embryonic to postnatal development. We anticipate that the gene mapping transcriptome data generated in this project will be highly valuable to other scientists and have included a data sharing plan to make our raw data available to the scientific community. In specific aim 2 we will define and characterize mechanobiology of murine vocal fold as it progresses through embryonic development. In specific aim 3 we will utilize a combinatorial approach to evaluate mechanical and biochemical cues measured in the embryonic tissue microenvironment on murine vocal fold progenitor and candidate stem cells. Our findings have the potential to regulate and enhance fibrogenesis of stem cells. Continued identification and optimization of synergistic factor combinations and a deeper understanding of their effects on stem cell function will inform scaffold- and bioreactor-based strategies and accelerate efforts to regenerate vocal fold lamina propria. The innovative use of developmental biology as a motivation in our research strategy will serve as a platform for exponentially reforming key tissue engineering specifications in laryngology."
"9461529","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Light chain amyloidosis (AL) is a devastating disease caused by the clonal expansion of a malignant plasma cell that secretes a destabilized, amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chain (LC).  Amyloidogenic LCs undergo misfolding and concentration-dependent aggregation into toxic oligomers and amyloid fibrils that deposit on distal tissues such as the heart.  Thus, AL patients suffer from both a plasma cell malignancy and a systemic amyloid disease.  Current AL treatments use chemotherapy and autologous stem cell replacement to decrease the clonal plasma cell population, only indirectly affecting AL amyloid pathology.  While this approach is efficient for 70% of patients, the remaining 30% of patients are too sick from LC proteotoxicity to tolerate this treatment.  In order to treat these patients, new therapies must be developed to treat the LC proteotoxicity in AL pathology.  A challenge in developing such strategies is the heterogeneity of AL-associated, amyloidogenic LC sequences.  Thus, any strategy to ameliorate AL amyloid pathology must target a fundamental biologic mechanism that mediates toxicity of heterogeneous amyloidogenic LCs, but does not globally compromise organismal immunity or secretion of the endogenous secreted proteome.  We hypothesize that the activity of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis pathways is a critical determinant in toxic LC aggregation that can be targeted to ameliorate AL amyloid pathology.  ER proteostasis pathways can facilitate secretion of destabilized, amyloidogenic proteins, increasing their serum concentrations available for toxic misfolding and aggregation.  Thus, modulating the activity of ER proteostasis pathways offers a unique opportunity to reduce serum concentrations of destabilized, amyloidogenic LCs and thus decrease proteotoxic LC aggregation.  We show that adapting ER proteostasis pathways through stress-independent activation of select Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)-associated transcription factors reduces the secretion and extracellular aggregation of a destabilized, amyloidogenic LC, without affecting secretion of a non-amyloidogenic LC, IgGs or the global endogenous secreted proteome.  Here, we define the contribution of ER proteostasis pathways in toxic LC aggregation by identifying pathways preferentially involved in the secretion, extracellular aggregation and subsequent toxicity of amyloidogenic LCs.  Furthermore, we will demonstrate that small molecule ER proteostasis regulators that alter the activity of these ER proteostasis pathways reduce secretion and toxic aggregation of destabilized, amyloidogenic LCs in AL patient-derived plasma cells.  Through these efforts, we will show that the activity of ER proteostasis pathways is a fundamental determinant in dictating AL amyloid pathology.  Furthermore, we will identify first-in-class small molecule ER proteostasis regulators that target these pathways to attenuate secretion and toxic aggregation of amyloidogenic LCs.  Our results will establish ER proteostasis regulation as the first strategy to ameliorate AL amyloid pathology that can then be used in combination with chemotherapeutics to treat the AL patient cohort suffering from severe LC proteotoxicity."
"9604151","Project Summary Coccidioidomycosis affects residents in the southwestern United States, northern Mexico and scattered areas of South America. An estimated 150,000 people in the United States become infected with Coccidioides annually. There is an urgent unmet need to develop better chemotherapies and a vaccine against Coccidioides infection. This proposed study is to optimize protective efficacy and delineate immune mechanisms of a newly developed multivalent vaccine against coccidioidomycosis. The vaccine consists of a recombinant chimeric polypeptide antigen (rCPA2) composed of the most immunogenic fragments of 4 previously identified Coccidioides antigens and 5 predicted T-cell epitopes. Preliminary studies demonstrate robust and long-lasting adaptive T-cell responses following vaccination of human MHC II-expressing HLA-DR4 transgenic mice with glucan-chitin particles (GCPs) ?loaded? with rCPA2. Furthermore, optimized GCP-rCPA2 vaccine affords the best protective efficacy among 5 tested adjuvant formations and comparable to a live, attenuated ?T vaccine. The rCPA+GCP vaccine is well processed by macrophages and dendritic cells at the vaccination sites and mediates differential immune gene expressions leading to enhanced antigen presentation and Th1- and Th17- mixed polarization. Th17 immunity has shown to be indispensable for vaccine immunity against coccidioidomycosis. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that an optimized rCPA2 antigen loaded in GCP adjuvant/delivery system with an FDA-approved carrier can elicit a broad spectrum of protective immunity for humanized mice against infection with both species of Coccidioides. The goal is to investigate the protective mechanisms of the optimized GCP-rCPA2 vaccine using humanized murine models of coccidioidomycosis and human immune cells. There are 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1 is to create an optimized rCPA2 that can induce a broad spectrum and durable protective immunity against both species of Coccidioides. Human T-cell epitopes on rCPA2 will be mapped for 3 common human MHC II alleles. There is considerable morphological and genomic diversity among different isolates of C. posadasii and C. immitis. The optimized antigen will include dominant epitopes derived from both species of Coccidioides for multiple HLA alleles. Protective efficacy of the optimized vaccine will be tested to against two selected isolates of each Coccidioides species that present with the least homology of the antigens. Aim 2 is to optimize the GCP adjuvant formulation for eliciting a protective Th1- and Th17-mixed response against Coccidioides infection using both human and mouse APCs and CD4+ T cells. An optimized GCP adjuvant/delivery system will be created to maximize protective efficacy. Aim 3 To study the vaccine induced protective mechanism that guides Th1 and Th17 responses using murine models of coccidioidomycosis. Upon completion of this project an optimized and protective GCP2-rCPA2 vaccine will be identified for advancement to clinical trials for assessment of it safety and protective efficacy against coccidioidomycosis."
"9480040","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) is an innovative surgical procedure to return function to patients with severely debilitated shoulders. In 10 years of use in the US there have been significant advancements in implant design and surgical technique, and this evolution continues today. Advancements aside, there is still wide variability in patient outcomes that arise from their pathology, selection/placement of the implant, and the degree to which patient physiology compensates for the non-anatomic joint design. To increase functional range of motion (ROM) and reduce complications like scapular notching we must study the origins of their variability and create a benchmark against which to gauge future improvements. Also, we must generate prospective tools for clinicians to improve rTSA outcomes through modified surgical technique and implant selection. To do this we propose to: 1) Perform the first longitudinal analysis of recovery time-dependent changes in rTSA shoulder kinematics, 2) Integrate the first accurate model of dynamic 3D scapulothoracic/ humeral motion in a shoulder simulator, 3) Quantify the effects of humeral lengthening on external rotation ROM, and 4) Validate a prospective clinical algorithm to predict post-operative ROM in rTSA patients. The unique techniques outlined in this proposal provide a powerful toolkit to assess the impact of surgical intervention on the shoulder. In Aim 1, the research will differentiate the characteristic shoulder kinematics and implant configurations of patients with high and low ROM outcomes. The data will also lend insight into the onset of scapular notching as it relates to changes in scapulohumeral kinematics after rTSA. In Aim 2, a modular rTSA and dynamic scapula shoulder simulator will allow a kinematically accurate laboratory model of the shoulder to be used to investigate the relationships between humeral lengthening, joint center of rotation, and external rotation ROM. These data will be used to create a clinical algorithm that predicts post-operative ROM, which will be validated by predicting the degree of post-operative ROM in patients from Aim 1. Together these findings will benefit future rTSA patients as the goal of reducing variability and increasing achievable ROM is realized. The clinical ROM algorithm will give clinicians a new tool to prospectively assess the impact of rTSA implant component selection and placement on post-operative ROM. Kinematic data can be used to develop targeted rehabilitation protocols that stabilize the scapula and increase ROM in rTSA patients, or improve the accuracy of musculoskeletal models that examine motion and muscle forces in normal, pathologic and repaired/replaced shoulders. High accuracy bone/implant motion profiles can also be used to study rTSA phenomena like implant impingement/levering and joint instability, and precisely quantify skin marker motion artefacts common in shoulder motion analysis. Finally, the dynamic scapula simulator will create a platform to study not only rTSA, but any soft tissue repair or joint replacement using the normal, pathology- and repair-dependent motion of the shoulder as a baseline for comparison."
"9431485","Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have given us many clues about the mutations that cause common genetic diseases, including autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, many of the mutations implicated in disease lie outside of the genes themselves and instead lie in the regions controlling expression of the genes, and so probably contribute to disease by producing the wrong amount of the gene in the wrong tissue or at the wrong time. Mutations in regulatory regions are thought to cause disease by altering the binding of regulatory proteins to the DNA, changing the DNA sequence from one that the protein can bind to one that it cannot (or vice versa). However, the ways in which these regulatory proteins control gene expression remains incompletely understood and so it is presently difficult to understand which regulatory protein binds differently to a mutated regulatory region, or how that change in binding affects expression of the regulated genes. In fact, we still do not even know where the regulatory regions are in the tissues we think are dysfunctional in disease. This project aims to better understand how these mutations contribute to autoimmune disease by first increasing our understanding of how regulatory proteins and regulatory regions work to control when and where genes are expressed, and then applying this knowledge to understand genetic disease. First, regulatory regions will be identified in immune cells and their effects on gene expression measured so that mutations that are likely to contribute to disease (those in regulatory regions) can be identified. The relationship between regulatory proteins, regulatory sequence, and gene expression will be learned by creating millions of synthetic regulatory regions and measuring their effect on gene expression, providing many examples of binding sites for each regulatory protein from which to learn. Finally, our new understanding of gene regulation will be applied to determine which genetic mutations change regulatory protein binding and cause disease. This will help us better understand the underlying causes of disease so that new treatments can be developed that target the mutations within each person. The candidate's long term career goals are to better understand how gene regulation works in humans so that we can better understand how the sequence of the genome controls the expression of our genes. The candidate currently works at the Broad Institute, a leading institute in human genetics and genomics with the resources and personnel required of this project. In order to continue to develop as a scientist, the candidate will gain more experience teaching, publish and present his existing findings, gain the necessary skills to work with human cells, and secure a faculty position and funding so that he can continue to make a positive impact on our knowledge of the genome."
"9584882","SUMMARY  Yersinia pestis, the etiologic agent of plague, has been responsible for high mortality in several epidemics throughout human history. Plague has been classified as a re-emerging disease by the World Health Organization since there are several thousand reported cases of the disease worldwide annually and Y. pestis strains resistant to multiple drugs have been detected in recent years. The plague bacillus began to be used as a biological weapon at least 800 years ago and is today one of the more likely biological threats. Currently, no licensed plague vaccines are available in Western world. Isolation of virulent F1-negative Y. pestis strains from natural sources and the existence of lcrV polymorphisms in Yersinia may result in Y. pestis variants that escape protective immunity induced by LcrV and F1 antigens. Therefore, vaccines solely based upon LcrV and F1 antigens may be insufficient to guarantee long-term defense against plague in humans. In order to overcome the drawbacks of vaccines composed of LcrV and F1 antigens, we propose to use Y. pestis OMVs as an acellular vaccine against plague: (1) Construct Y. pestis strains which robustly produce self-adjuvanted and highly immunogenic OMVs; (2) Evaluate protective immunities of OMVs in murine model. Finally, the success of this project will provide a rational strategy for designing highly effective and safe plague vaccines for human use."
"9532968","PROJECT SUMMARY  The overarching goal of the proposed research is to improve our understanding of the neurobiological basis of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In this project we will analyze sequencing data collected from tens of thousands of individuals with and without ASD, and examine the rate at which gene knockouts (mutations that disrupt both functional copies of a gene) occur. Gene knockouts, while rare, can reveal critical biological pathways that teach us about the basis of disease.  We will compare and contrast rates and patterns of these knockouts between cases and controls, study the effect of gender, and relate these patterns to the known preponderance of males with ASD. We will also use this data to generate a catalog of specific genes that are knocked out more frequently in individuals with ASD than in the general population. Finally, from this catalog, the strongest gene candidates will be chosen for neurobiological functional studies, to provide insight into how dysfunction may alter brain development and plasticity in autistic individuals."
"9585622","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coxiella burnetii is the causative agent of human Q fever, a zoonotic disease that can cause a debilitating, flu- like illness in acute cases, or a life-threatening endocarditis in chronically infected patients. Q fever patients present with few distinguishing clinical features, and chronic disease requires a minimum of 18 months of antibiotic treatment, highlighting the need for new therapeutics. An obligate intracellular pathogen, Coxiella survives inside a vacuole with characteristics of a functional phagolysosome, including active proteases and phosphatases and moderately acidic pH, a physicochemical parameter to which C. burnetii is exquisitely adapted. C. burnetii is a strict moderate acidophile capable of efficient nutrient transport and catabolism and replication only within a narrow pH range under both host cell-free and intracellular conditions. The objective of this application is to identify host and pathogen factors that maintain both CCV and bacterial cytoplasmic pH. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that C. burnetii manipulates host lysosomal biogenesis by blocking activation of the transcription factor TFEB. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that C. burnetii controls bacterial cytoplasmic pH via carbonic anhydrase-dependent generation of HCO3- and active uptake of K+. Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind C. burnetii survival within the moderately acidic environment of the CCV will allow identification of potential therapeutic targets."

For the ET-CTN to realize this opportunity, it needs to effectively navigate many scientific and operational issues in early phase drug development. To address these challenges, we propose a new strategic partnership in early oncology drug development across the Duke Cancer Institute, the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at UNC, and the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University. The Duke-UNC-Wash U Partnership creates an ET-CTN site composed of three of the nation's NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers and leverages their combined clinical and scientific expertise to advance drug development in cancer. This Partnership provides world class breadth and depth, both clinically and scientifically, to meet the goals of the ET-CTN. Combined, this partnership manages over 18,000 new cancer cases per year; in 2012, the three centers enrolled more than 3,200 new patients onto early phase clinical trials similar to the ones envisioned by the ET-CTN. Our site has both the clinical expertise and the clinical volumes needed for the study of novel agents targeting niche populations, and our site will connect the ET-CTN to our tremendous basic and translational cancer research communities from which new drugs and therapeutic approaches are likely to emerge. We also have particular expertise in the management of multi-center studies and the analysis of biomarkers on these studies, experience directly relevant to the ET-CTN. We also bring world class expertise in molecular genomic and proteomic profiling and biomarker development. The Duke-UNC-Wash U Partnership will help achieve ET-CTN goals through the following specific steps; (1) engaging world class disease and translational teams that are collaborative and team-science oriented; (2) developing innovative strategies and approaches for development of novel anti-cancer agents and combination regimens and participating in ET-CTN project teams to generate drug development plans for novel approaches; (3) efficiently developing high-quality formal proposals and protocols in response to requests from the NCI's Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP); (4) effectively managing trials and accruing rapidly to all ET-CTN trials; and (5) translating information gained from the trials and correlative studies, both bench-to-bedside and bedside-to-bench; and (6) mentoring new investigators and fellows in oncology drug development.

RELEVANCE:  The Duke-UNC-Wash U Partnership is committed and ideally suited to realizing the goals of the ET-CTN to rapidly translate novel science into more effective cancer therapies"
"9480046","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment tailored to specific patient characteristics (i.e. personalized medicine) will have a significant positive impact on the delivery of healthcare. Personalized medicine for musculoskeletal pain conditions is a high priority because these conditions are a heavy burden to society due their economic impact and suffering they cause. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this line of research is to develop personalized interventions for musculoskeletal pain that ameliorate musculoskeletal pain and lessen their burden on society. We study shoulder pain because it is a common musculoskeletal pain condition and in the initial funding period we identified combinations of genetic and psychological risk factors indicative of chronic shoulder pain. In particular, a combination of COMT genetic variants and pain catastrophizing formed a high risk subgroup predictive of heightened shoulder pain responses in a pre-clinical exercise-induced injury cohort and poor 12 month outcomes in a clinical post-operative shoulder pain cohort. This promising and robust finding provided the impetus to transition this line of research to an intervention phase. The renewal application will provide resources for this multidisciplinary research team to determine mechanisms and efficacy of personalized pharmaceutical and psychological pain interventions designed to target genetic and psychological factors that comprise the high risk subgroup. The pharmaceutical intervention will be propranolol as it counters the effects of decreased COMT enzyme. The psychological intervention will be cognitive restructuring that lessen the impact of pain catastrophizing. Our primary hypothesis is that subjects receiving the combined personalized pharmaceutical and personalized psychological intervention will have decreased shoulder pain duration, peak pain intensity, and peak upper-extremity disability following exercise-induced shoulder injury, when compared to the combined placebo condition. In addition, we will investigate psychological, molecular, and pain sensitivity regulation as mechanisms of pain relief. Successful completion of the proposed study will have a strong impact on the field as it has the potential to alter standard of care by discovering effective personalized pain treatments for individuals that, without the treatments, would go on to develop chronic shoulder pain. Completion of this study will also provide critical foundational data for designing a subsequent clinical trial in a post-operative shoulder pain cohort."
"9509357","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psoriasis is a cutaneous autoimmune disease that affects as many as 125 million people worldwide. Current therapeutics for psoriasis include systemic acting immuno-suppressive drugs for which the long-term effects remain a concern. Psoriasis is a cell-mediated disease dependent on T helper (Th) 17 effector cells that are biased by cutaneous DCs. Importantly, the stimuli that induce DCs and keratinocytes to secrete Th polarizing cytokines, particularly in psoriasis, are complex and not completely understood. In this context, ATP is a particularly appealing alarmin that, via P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) signaling, induces NF-¿B activation and the IL- 23/IL-17 axis, both of which have been shown to be psoriasis susceptibility pathways. Thus, P2X7R signaling links early inflammatory triggers with psoriasis susceptibility factors. Interestingly, NF-¿B also leads to the maintenance of P2X7R expression forming a positive feedback mechanism. Results from our ongoing studies support a currently unappreciated role for P2X7R signaling in psoriasis pathogenesis. Specifically, we provide evidence that in healthy human skin, P2X7R signaling induces innate immunity, stimulates DCs to express IL- 1ß, IL-6, IL-23, IL-15, and VEGF, and promotes a Th17 bias. Additionally, P2X7R expression is increased in lesional and non-lesional skin of psoriatic patients compared to healthy donors. This increased P2X7R expression in non-lesional skin represents a primary abnormality in the skin of patients with psoriasis, rather than a secondary effect of inflammation. Supported by this theoretical and experimental rationale, we hypothesize that within a genetically susceptible microenvironment cutaneous P2X7R signaling is a mechanism of psoriasis pathogenesis that can be a target for therapeutics. Thus, our goal in this preclinical proposal is to determine the involvement of P2X7R signaling in the development and maintenance of psoriatic lesions, and to elucidate novel P2X7R-dependent pathogenic mechanisms that can be exploited for novel psoriasis therapies. To test our novel and innovative hypothesis we have established the following specific aims: Aim 1 will define the inflammatory pathways induced by cutaneous P2X7R signaling. Aim 2 will establish the involvement of P2X7R signaling in psoriasis pathogenesis within a genetically susceptible microenvironment, and Aim 3 will examine the therapeutic capacity of P2X7R antagonist to diminish psoriatic lesions. The conserved nature of ATP and P2X7R signaling pathways in mice and humans supports the translational value of the studies we propose and provide an opportunity to utilize a unique and innovative approach by combing both human and murine models of psoriasis. At the conclusion of this proposal we will have determined that P2X7R signaling is pathogenic in genetically susceptible psoriatic microenvironments. Our results will lead to an increased scientific knowledge base, the development of a model to further examine P2X7R signaling mechanisms and psoriasis pathogenesis, and proof-of-principle studies for new therapeutic strategies for future proposals."

The core will leverage the outstanding expertise, equipment and other capabilities of the MUSC Center for Biomedical Imaging, which supports extensive human and animal imaging studies. COBRE funds will support a Bioengineer (shared with the BSTIM Core) who will oversee the technical aspects of the Core, and develop new methods to interface image acquisition with stimulation and rehabilitation techniques; a full-time Image Analyst who will provide the COBRE investigators training and assistance with data interpretation of fMRI, spectroscopy, and diffusion MRI measurements; and the dedicated effort of senior faculty who will provide mentoring and training as to the optimum imaging methods for both acquisition and analysis. The aims of the NI Core are to: (1) provide SCRCRS investigators with turnkey access to the tools of modern neuroimaging to study the interactions/correlations among recovery of function and changes in brain morphology, connectivity, metabolism and function; (2) develop a series of specific tools to observe the detailed neural responses, both short-term and long-term, to diverse rehabilitation regimens, and train SCRCRS investigators in their application and analysis; (3) mentor the SCRCRS Junior Investigators in the acquisition and analysis of complex neuroimaging data through the use of standard image analysis tools such as SPM and FSL as well as 'in-house' developed software; and (4) establish the Neuroimaging Core as a lead resource in the integration of neuroimaging into stroke rehabilitation studies at MUSC and beyond. The NI Core Director will facilitate investigator access to multiple modes of structural and functional imaging relevant to stroke recovery research, such as BOLD, DTI, DKI, fMRI, MRS and resting-state connectivity. Several categories of localized brain information generated via imaging will be collected and analyzed, e.g., tissue volume, stroke pathology, correlates of basal metabolism, local estimates of cellular complexity, regional responses to localized brain stimulation from TMS and their corresponding functional responses. An innovative feature of the Nl Core will be development of capabilities to capture multiple modes of data in conjunction with neuroimaging data, e.g., development of devices and algorithms for more accurate measurement of physical function/movement with the subject inside the scanner. Notably, MUSC investigators were the first in the world to image TMS in the scanner with fMRI. This technological skill provides a rare ability to observe in patients the brain regions most affected by the different stimulations and identify the most relevant areas involved in therapeutic response. In addition, the 7T small animal scanner provides a sensitive translational tool to investigate mechanisms underlying rehabilitation and cortical stimulation enhancement of neural plasticity and recovery from stroke in animal models. The NI Core and its users will benefit from a sound management plan, prescribed set of procedures for accessing core services, and a robust mentoring plan."

The course will be held the first week of September 2017 through 2021 on the MDI Biological Laboratory campus, in Bar Harbor, Maine. The proposed course provides renal fellows with hands-on research education in fundamental concepts of homeostasis and exposes them to the classical experiments that form the foundation of renal physiology and nephrology. Seven course modules are proposed: glomerular filtration, proximal tubule function, thick ascending limb cotransporters, salt secretion and balance, collecting duct sodium transport /ENaC, water homeostasis, and acid/base homeostasis. Each of the seven modules runs in three consecutive two-day rotations (Monday-Tuesday, Wednesday-Thursday, and Friday-Saturday), with the first day of each rotation involving intensive experimental work, and the second day involving analysis and presentation of the work to the entire course group. Each participant will complete three of the six planned modules during the three rotations. A case study-based Responsible Conduct in Research program will precede each rotation. Origins of Renal Physiology is entirely unique among national renal short courses. The course provides participants with research tools that give them a deeper understanding of concepts of physiological homeostasis which is difficult to attain during normal clinical training schedules. The course is open to renal fellows and, since 2010, on a space-available basis, medical residents entering nephrology.

"9636216","ABSTRACT To contain the HIV epidemic in Kenya and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, innovative strategies for identifying  and treating HIV-infected persons who inject drugs (PWID) are critically important. It is also essential that factors contributing to onward transmission are better understood if prevention and treatment programs are to be brought to scale for key affected populations. The study will be co-led by Dr. Carey Farquhar and Dr. Joshua Herbeck and is a collaborative effort between the University of Washington, Kenyatta National Hospital, the University of Kwa-Zulu-Natal, Kenya Ministry of Health and a local NGO, Support for Addiction Prevention and Treatment in Africa (SAPTA). The study will determine whether assisting HIV-infected PWID to notify their partners can be a successful strategy for HIV testing and linkage to care, and whether assisted partner  notification services (APS) can be leveraged to identify individuals at high risk for hepatitis C (HCV). The primary objective is to determine how many needle-sharing and sexual partners per HIV-infected PWID accessing HIV testing services can be tested, diagnosed HIV- or HCV-positive, linked to appropriate services, and engaged in care at 3 months post-testing. To achieve this, health advisors experienced in APS will recruit and enroll 1000 HIV-infected participants at 3 needle-syringe program clinics in the Mathare slum area of Nairobi. Together with peer educators from SAPTA, study health advisors will inform partners of the exposure to HIV and HCV and arrange for testing at the clinic or another venue. This strategy has not been used among PWID for HIV or HCV, however, it has recently been shown to be acceptable and feasible in the general population in Kenya. Our second and third aims leverage the ability of APS to identify new HIV and HCV cases and use phylogenetics to  characterize modes of transmission and risk factors for ongoing HIV and HCV transmission in this key population. Blood spots will be collected on filter paper from 1000 HIV-infected and 1000 HCV-infected PWID in the network and HIV and HCV will be sequenced at the University of KwaZulu-Natal research laboratory. This type of molecular epidemiology approach has not been used in this population for HIV or HCV and holds great promise when combined with collection of sociodemographic and behavioral data for defining population level factors contributing significantly to onward transmission of these two viruses. We anticipate that our results will shape the success of future prevention efforts in Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa by enabling public health programs to target high-risk clusters, and this will in turn pave the way for more in-depth research on effective screening and service delivery PWID."
"9477617","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder remodeling occurs as a result of diverse insults and injury to the lower urinary tract, including urethral obstruction, infection, inflammaton and neural injury, and is central to the development of fibrosis, loss of compliance and the voiding dysfunction that ensues. Despite study over several decades, the molecular signals underlying pathologic bladder remodeling remain poorly understood. Current treatments rely heavily on pharmacological modulation of the cholinergic and adrenergic axes. Although these interventions are effective for some patients, these agents only provide symptomatic relief and do not target underlying disease processes. Thus, the identification of novel pathways that actually drive pathologic remodeling is essential if fundamentally new strategies for therapy are to be developed. Evidence obtained during the current funding cycle has implicated the AP-1 and MYC transcriptional complexes as key drivers of bladder smooth muscle cell response to fibroproliferative signals, including mechanical stimulation in vitro and in vivo, and the mitogen, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). In the first global assessment of the PDGFR-regulated transcriptome and proteome in any organ or cell type, we used expression profiling, quantitative proteomics analysis, and state-of-the-art bioinformatics and identified MYC and JUN/AP-1 as the most significantly networked transcriptional regulators in PDGF-stimulated primary bladder smooth muscle cells (pBSMC). MYC emerged for the first time as a novel master regulator of PDGF- stimulated transcription. Upregulation of MYC and JUN/AP1, and their gene targets were confirmed in PDGF- treated pBSMC and in response to acute bladder outlet obstruction in vivo. Pharmacologic inhibition confirmed the involvement of MYC and JUN/AP-1 in regulation of pBSMC behaviors, such as proliferation and migration that contribute to pathologic remodeling. Based on these observations we hypothesize that AP-1 and MYC are key instigators of fibroproliferative remodeling in bladder smooth muscle and represent novel therapeutic targets in the setting of bladder fibrosis. This hypothesis will be tested with the following Specific Aims (1) Determine the functional significance of the MYC-centric network in bladder smooth muscle remodeling. (2) Determine the effect of pharmacologic inhibition of AP-1 on remodeling and fibrosis in the context of bladder outlet obstruction. We will employ rodent models of partial bladder outlet obstruction and spinal cord injury, together with morphological, functional and expression analyses to determine the consequences of MYC and AP-1 perturbation in vivo. At the end of the project period we will understand the biological significance of AP-1 and MYC in fibroproliferation and whether they represent `druggable' targets capable of attenuating the deleterious consequences of bladder wall remodeling."

The effects of ionizing radiation on the lineage commitment of skeletal stem cells (a subset of marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) also known as bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells) is poorly defined, and warrants further study. The experiments that are described in the proposal will determine how radiation impacts the development and cumulative bone forming activity of the osteoblast and its precursor cells. The proposed experiments are designed to test the hypothesis that radiation depletes the osteogenic potential of mesenchymal progenitor cells and promotes adipogenic differentiation as an alternate fate, and that reconstitution of BMSCs will mitigate the structural and metabolic deficits characteristic of irradiated bone. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) Examine depletion of BMSC-derived osteoprogenitors as a factor driving radiation-induced bone loss; (2) Assess P-PAR? as a therapeutic target in radiation-induced bone loss; and (3) Evaluate efficacy of BMSC as a mitigant of radiation-induced bone loss. These aims will be accomplished through the use of mouse models and cell culture experiments in combination with genetic, pharmacologic and cell-based therapeutic strategies. Greater understanding of the adverse effects of ionizing radiation on the multi-lineage differentiation capacity of BMSC may yield new therapeutic targets for the prevention and/or correction of bone loss that may be experienced following radiotherapy."
"9482734","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 award for Nirav Bhakta, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in pulmonary medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Bhakta is beginning a career as a young investigator in translational research in asthma. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways in the lungs that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, cough and shortness of breath. There has been a dramatic increase in the prevalence, morbidity, and economic burden associated with asthma over the past 40 years. This K23 award will provide Dr. Bhakta with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to develop an independent patient-centered translational research career focused on airway diseases; (2) to advance the application of multi-color flow cytometry to human tissue samples to quantitatively evaluate inflammatory pathways; (3) develop expertise in using airway epithelial cells in culture as a model system to interpret human data; and (4) to apply advanced biostatistical methods to the development of biomarkers to predict response to molecularly-targeted therapies. To achieve these goals, Dr. Bhakta has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Prescott Woodruff, an expert in translational asthma research and molecular phenotyping of asthma; a co-mentor, Dr. John Fahy, an expert in translational asthma research and airway epithelial cell biology; and 4 grant advisory committee members: Dr. Mark Ansel, an immunologist with expertise in immune cell subsets and multi-color flow-cytometry; Dr. Dean Sheppard, a senior researcher studying inflammatory pathways in mouse models of asthma; and Dr. David Erle, an expert in the application of high-throughput technologies and statistical methods to study gene networks in asthma; and Dr. Mark Segal, a senior biostatistician with extensive experience in high-throughput data analysis. There is growing recognition that asthma is not a single disease, but rather has many different forms leading to variability in severity and response to medications between patients. It is likely that these differences are driven by the predominance of distinct underlying pathways of inflammation, the discovery of which would inform the development of novel targeted therapies. Identification of one such pathway, inflammation driven by T helper 2 (Th2) cells, has led to a novel blood biomarker (periostin) which predicts response to Th2-targeted therapy, proving the concept that molecular phenotyping can guide cytokine-targeted therapies. However, Th2 inflammation explains only a subset of asthma, and there is a need to identify other pathways, especially for the 10% of asthmatics who are severe and do not respond to standard therapies. The proposed research will investigate the role of one such pathway, inflammation driven by IL-17 cytokines, which preliminary findings lead us to hypothesize is associated with heightened eosinophilic inflammation and two cardinal features of severe asthma: excessive airway narrowing and mucous overproduction. An ongoing bronchoscopy study in severe asthmatics will be leveraged to obtain airway washings and tissues to test these hypotheses. The numbers of IL-17 cytokine- expressing cells will be assessed in these tissues with flow cytometry and microscopic examination, and their association with inflammatory cells, clinical airway narrowing, and mucous overproduction determined. Importantly, the proposed study will combine this data with experiments on isolated cells to develop biomarkers in the blood and sputum that reflect IL-17-driven inflammation in the lung. These biomarkers have the potential to improve asthma care by providing a test to identify the individuals most likely to respond to IL-17-targeted drugs already in development by pharmaceutical companies."
"9506887","The vastly reduced life expectancy in schizophrenia is primarily due to medical comorbidities, yet these are often overlooked in a research context. Numerous psychiatric and somatic diagnoses have increased rates in schizophrenia, and the majority of schizophrenia patients have comorbid conditions. Since lifestyle factors and medication side-effects likely contribute to many of these increased medical problems, it has been difficult to resolve the extent to which shared biological underpinnings contribute to comorbid conditions. The aims for this proposal will be accomplished using data from the Genomic Aggregation Project in Sweden (GAPS) with >200k genotyped subjects and comprehensive medical and demographic information from the Swedish National Registers. This wealth of information allows for additional clinical risk from schizophrenia-associated variants to be captured. In Aim 1, carriers of previously identified schizophrenia risk variants without this diagnosis will be studied for increased risk of diagnoses across multiple psychiatric and somatic domains compared to non-carriers using logistic regression. Furthermore, comorbidities may offer clues to the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to different forms of schizophrenia. With this in mind, comorbid conditions will be leveraged to define schizophrenia subtypes in Aim 2 using the >5000 cases in the Swedish Schizophrenia Study within GAPS. Following cluster analysis using comorbidities, validity will be assessed by testing for group differences in genetic and clinical variation. These studies will yield new insights into the relationships between schizophrenia and other medical conditions, and identify subtypes of schizophrenia that will facilitate personalized medical care."
"9433602","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For unknown reasons, the incidence of allergies and asthma continues to increase in the US. It is increasingly clear that asthma is a heterogeneous disease with differing endotypes which suggest discrete pathophysiology. In humans, asthma exists in allergic and non-allergic forms. It is an unmet need in the field to better understand ho different mechanisms contribute to asthma endotypes. Genome wide array analysis has identified many asthma relevant genes. However, due to poor correlation between steady state mRNA levels and protein, transcriptomic approaches may overlook critical genes. Posttranscriptional gene regulation by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly recognized as important control mechanisms for proinflammatory genes. RBPs, such as HuR (elav1) which bind to AU-rich elements (AREs) play critical roles in coordinately regulating proinflammatory genes in asthma by stabilizing target gene mRNAs and increasing translatability. Methods used by our lab and others, called RNA immunoprecipitation applied to microarrays (RIP-Chip) have identified how RBPs are coordinately regulating inflammation. Posttranscriptional gene regulation plays an important role in CD4+ T differentiation, yet these processes are poorly understood. Our long term goal is to understand posttranscriptional gene regulation in airway inflammation. The objective of this application, which is our next step in pursuit of that goal, is to understand how HuR is regulating key molecules, such as Th2/Th17 cytokines and IL-2 during allergen challenge. The central esis is that the RBP, HuR, is permissive for development of CD4+ Th2 mediated allergic airway inflammation and required for normal IL-2 homeostatic expression. The rationale for this proposal is that our work has demonstrated that HuR controls both Th2 and Th17 differentiation. HuR KO mice do not develop airway inflammation due to suppression of Th2 cytokine production and do not have the ability to turn off IL-2 expression following T cell activation. Understanding posttranscriptional mechanisms of IL-2 and Th2/Th17 cytokine gene regulation will allow the field to modulate and affect outcomes of inflammatory responses in allergen driven asthma and also perhaps aid in better defining the heterogeneity amongst asthma endotypes. We plan to test the central esis and accomplish these objectives by the following four specific aims: 1) Does HuR ablation alter CD4+ Th subset differentiation?; 2) Determine whether HuR is required for allergic airway inflammation in vivo; 3) Mechanistic determinants of IL-2 and Th2 cytokine expression; 4) Determine whether human lymphocytes have dysregulated HuR expression. We believe our study is innovative, because such approaches will provide novel mechanistic insights into T cell posttranscriptional cytokine regulation. The proposed research is significant, because it will elucidate how airway responses connect at the molecular level with both adaptive and innate immunity to control lung inflammation."
"9482752","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is being submitted by Anna Zemke, MD PhD and entitled Nebulized Nitrite as a Novel Antimicrobial Therapy in Cystic Fibrosis. Dr. Zemke is a pulmonologist at the University of Pittsburgh and requires additional training in human subjects research to continue her professional development toward the long-term goal of conducting translational pulmonary research, with a focus on chronic bacterial infections. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to: (1) Gain an in-depth understanding of conducting pulmonary translational studies, (2) Become an expert in the biology of pulmonary bacterial infections, and (3) Become proficient at techniques used to study bacterial physiology. Integral to the training plan is the Certificate in Clinical Research Program, which includes needed statistical, ethical, and regulatory training. This work will be conducted within the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care at the University of Pittsburgh, which has a strong history of training physician- scientists and a superb infrastructure for both training Dr. Zemke and conducting the proposed translational research. The central objective of this research proposal is to develop nebulized sodium nitrite as an antimicrobial agent in cystic fibrosis (CF). Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal disease among Caucasian Americans and is marked by progressive respiratory failure and airway infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infects up to 80% of adults with CF, and grows in highly antibiotic resistant biofilms within the lung. Triggerin bacteria to disperse from biofilms may allow for improved clearance by the host and improved antibiotic efficacy. Sodium nitrite (AIR001) is an agent that combines antimicrobial activity, through the suppression of bacterial respiration, with the ability to disperse established biofilms When AIR001 is combined with colistimethate, it has additional activity against P. aeruginosa biofilms. AIR001 has not been tested in the CF population, but it has excellent safety data in pulmonary hypertension patients. The first research aim consists of proof-of-concept studies for developing nebulized nitrite and colistimethate combinations for treating P. aeruginosa airway infections in adults with CF. This aim tests the hypothesis that nebulization of nitrite and colistimethate is safe in subjects with CF and collects proof-of-concept efficacy data. The second aim will test the hypothesis that nitrite disperses biofilms in a nutritionally complex environment and then determine the mechanism of nitrite-induced biofilm dispersal. The combination of (1) formal human subjects research training;(2) hands-on, innovative research experience that includes both early phase safety protocols and further basic science; (3) an experienced, diverse mentorship team; and (4) the strong institutional environment of the Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Division at the University of Pittsburgh will equip Dr. Zemke for a career in translational pulmonary research."
"9530679","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Circulating blood cell counts represent important intermediate phenotypes for a variety of cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, and immunologic diseases. These traits differ by ethnicity and studying the genetics of these quantitative blood traits in African Americans (AAs) may reveal new biologic pathways that ultimately contribute to our understanding both of biology of blood cell production and of the relationship of blood counts with CVD and other chronic diseases that disproportionately impact AAs. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to date, performed mainly in European Americans, have implicated a number of genomic loci. Despite these successes, association signals for blood cell traits are often associated with uncertain effects on gene function or regulation, and therefore not readily translatable to clinical practice or treatment. Several recen advancements hold promise for translating genetic association findings for blood cell traits into mechanism-based therapeutic approaches for clinical disease. First, genome-wide mapping of blood cell type- and lineage-specific promoter and enhancer elements, transcription factor binding patterns and epigenetic profiling now provide a detailed picture of the cis- and trans- regulatory landscape during hematopoiesis. Second, experimental approaches utilizing genome engineering (RNA- guided CRISPR-Cas9) can characterize critical regulatory elements and functional variants of modest effect that are essential for stage-specific, lineage-restricted effects on gene expression. This proposal will utilize the wealth of newly available genetic data in multiple large AA cohorts, including exome array data on ~11,400 participants from the REasons for Geographical And Regional Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), the Jackson Heart (JHS) and Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies and high-coverage whole genome sequence (WGS) data available on ~3,500 JHS participants through a recent NHLBI-funded WGS initiative to discover and functionally characterize novel genetic associations. These data will be combined with existing GWAS and exome array data on thousands of additional AAs with measured blood cell traits to form the largest and most comprehensive genetic study of blood cell traits ever conducted in AAs. Our study will use novel and established analytic and experimental approaches, consistent with the goals and directives of this initiative, to identify important genetic variants affecting these important blood-based biomarkers."

"9477468","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1/STK11) signaling pathway has an established role in defining cellular responses to changes in energy homeostasis and metabolism. LKB1 signaling functions through a set of 14 kinase targets which provide distinct contributions and cell-type specific regulation of the LKB1 signaling axis. Beyond its role in energy homeostasis, metabolism, cell polarity and stress responses, LKB1 expression and activity has an important role as a tumor suppressor. Its role as a tumor suppressor is observed by its genomic loss in Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome which leads to increased lifetime risk of a number of malignancies as well as somatic mutation of LKB1 expression or function resulting in a number of solid tumor cancers. While more recent studies have begun to expand upon our understanding of LKB1 signaling and its mechanisms, there has been limited investigation into defining the individual contributions of its kinase targets in the regulation of the cancer phenotype. We have been investigating LKB1 signaling in breast cancer and have demonstrated a role for LKB1 in selective suppression of in vitro invasion and in vivo metastasis. We have further begun to define the kinase targets of LKB1 required for activity and demonstrated regulation of gene expression, transcription factor targeting and altered metabolism. The objective in this proposed project is to define the role of LKB1 and its downstream signaling and gene expression networks as potential therapeutic targets in the regulation of breast cancer invasion and metastasis. We have proposed the overall hypothesis that an LKB1 signaling axis, through downstream NUAK2 and SIK1, targets invasion and EMT related gene expression coordinate to suppression of metastasis in basal sub-type breast cancer. To accomplish this we proposal the following aims: Aim 1- To define the role for and mechanisms of LKB1 signaling in sub-type selective regulation of breast cancer cell tumorigenesis and metastasis, Aim 2- To test the requirement for downstream kinase targets of LKB1 signaling axis that selectively suppresses the invasive phenotype, Aim 3- To identify the role and mechanisms of direct NUAK2 and SIK1 signaling in suppression of breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis. This research will have an impact in several key areas. A- We are focusing on defining the breast cancer sub-type selective effects of LKB1 signaling. By defining the contribution of LKB1 and target kinases in basal versus Her2/neu or luminal sub-types we expect to define its unique role, mechanism of action and most importantly a translation of our findings into the clinical setting by sub-type selective targeted therapy for breast cancers. B- We seek to define the mechanisms by which the LKB1 axis suppresses invasion/metastasis in our breast cancer systems. By defining the kinome-transcriptome pathways that distinctly regulate the metastatic and metabolic phenotype of breast cancer we hope to define novel avenues of therapeutic targeting and earlier interventions that target the primary tumor preventing the metastatic spread of the disease."
"9475303","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Episodic memory is characterized by our ability to remember the spatial and temporal context in which events occur. There is substantial evidence that the hippocampal neuronal activity reflects a representation of space but, until recently, little was known about whether or how the hippocampal neurons encode time. However, recent studies by us have shown that hippocampal neuronal activity provides a temporal context signal that contributes to memory. In addition there is now evidence, substantially accumulated in this project, that hippocampal neurons - called time cells - fire during particular moments in a temporally extended experience, similar to hippocampal place cells that fire associated with particular locations in a spatially extended environment. The proposed studies will continue to explore the nature of temporal representation by the hippocampal system and associated brain areas. Experiments so far have focused on time cell activity during a gap between remembered events in order to identify an unambiguous timing signal in the absence of dynamic external events and while holding place and behavior constant. In the next phase of the project we will explore how time cells organize a sequence of events that compose specific episodes. Also, all recordings of hippocampal time cells have so far been examined only in area CA1. We will examine whether temporal coding is limited to CA1 or widespread in the hippocampus and other medial temporal and prefrontal areas. We will also explore whether temporal sequencing is created within intrinsic hippocampal circuits or whether temporal coding within the hippocampus depends on inputs from cortical areas. These studies will challenge the prevalent view that the hippocampal system is dedicated to spatial navigation and advance our understanding of how this system represents events in their spatiotemporal context."
"9478545","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Osteoporosis, a disease of low bone mineral density associated with increased risk of fracture, is both a significant health problem and a considerable socioeconomic burden and there remains an unmet need for new therapies that would reduce the incidence of osteoporosis in the US. Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling plays a prominent role in skeletal development and fracture repair, and there is increasing evidence positively linking BMP signaling to bone formation in the adult skeleton. Here, we focus on the cellular and molecular events that regulate BMP signaling in bone cells. We show, using a mouse model developed in our lab that changing the composition of the type 2 BMP receptor pool present on bone forming cells influences the amount of bone they produce in vivo. Surprisingly, when mice lack the type 2 BMP receptor, BMPR2, on bone forming cells, normal levels of BMP signaling in bone still occur, but there is an unexpected reduction in the level of Activin/TGF? signaling. In these mice, the cells that build bone work harder while the cells that destroy bone work at a normal pace, causing the animals to have high bone mass. We believe that our results are due to the fact that the remaining type 2 receptors present on bone forming cells, ACVR2A/B, are shared between BMPs and Activins, another group of signaling molecules that are known to negatively affect bone formation. BMPs and Activins now have to compete for the remaining type 2 receptors, and information suggests that this competition would favor BMPs. Collectively, this leads us to hypothesize that interplay between BMP and Activin/TGF? signaling regulates bone formation in the adult skeleton. In this proposal, we explore two interrelated ideas that impact how we view the interaction of BMP and Activin/TGF? signaling in the adult skeleton. First, we suggest that competition between BMPs and Activins for shared type 2 receptors is a physiological event that influences bone formation in vivo. Second, we suggest that signaling antagonism between the BMP and Activin/TGF? pathways occurring downstream of receptor engagement is another means by which the bone mass is regulated in the adult skeleton. In three specific aims, we ask: Why does removing BMPR2 from bone cells affect Activin signaling? What is the cellular mechanism leading to high bone mass in mice lacking BMPR2 expression in bones? And, does Activin signaling antagonize BMP signaling in the skeleton? These studies will add to our understanding of how bone formation is regulated by interactions between the BMP and Activin/TGF? pathways and could identify future therapeutic approaches to treat bone diseases."
"9416707","CORE SUMMARY Core C is Gene Delivery Scientific Core whose goal is to provide Program Investigators with complete in vitro and in vivo gene delivery solutions to facilitate completion of their specific aims. To accomplish this goal, the Core C will channel its activities into three principal areas: a) providing services; b) developing and acquiring new technologies, and c) building synergy with Projects and other Cores. Service component: The Core C will serve a resource for all genetic manipulation needs of Projects and Cores of this Program. Specifically, the Core C will a) achieve economy of scale and quality assurance through centralized generation of recombinant DNA, viral constructs, and genetically modified microorganisms by highly trained personnel; b) provide technical expertise, consultation and training in PCR, RT-PCR, qPCR, DNA sequencing, gene delivery to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, constitutive and regulated gene silencing; c) execute gene targeting and CRISPR/Cas and TALEN-mediated gene editing in cultured cells for the needs of PPG projects; d) provide PPG Projects with enabling technologies for the production of genetically modified laboratory animals, such as Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) modification, generation CRISPR/Cas constructs for genome editing and genotyping of genetically altered animals; e) provide PPG investigators with recombinant protein expression and purification expertise; f) Core C will provide training, experience and expertise in the field of mitochondrial biology, including generation of cells depleted of mitochondrial DNA and assays of bioenergetic status using Seahorse XF-24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Academic component: Throughout previous cycles of funding Gene Delivery Core responded to changing needs of the Projects by either acquiring new technologies or developing its own. This is exemplified by a spectrum of custom retro- and -lentiviral vectors developed by the Core C, development of a system for doxycycline-regulated gene expression, development of a system for regulated gene knockdown, by the development of the gene expression system with a two-tier regulation, etc. In the course of the proposed competitive renewal, Core C will fully implement, validate, and make available to a broad scientific community a system for endothelial segment-restricted gene expression. In addition, we plan to establish a system for point mutations knocking-in in endothelial cells. Synergy with Projects and Scientific Cores: The Core C is a convergence point for all Projects and Cores regarding genetic manipulation of pro- and eukaryotic organisms. The Core C also builds synergy with other Scientific Cores through, e.g. procurement of endothelial cell lines from Core B, modifying these cell lines for the expression of fluorescent reporters/sensors for the needs of Core D, and supplying these modified cell lines to Core D for the use and to Core B for distribution to scientific community."
"9478551","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Highly insoluble urate in the human body leads to both gouty arthritis and renal damage. Humans (and some other species) are uniquely susceptible to urate because we do not synthesize a functional uricase enzyme responsible for converting insoluble urate to more soluble molecules that can be easily excreted from the body. Crystallization during urate build- up causes both severe inflammation in the distal joints and kidney malfunction. Despite its clinical relevance, little is known about how or why the enzymes and transporters that produce and relocate urate in the body evolved in primates. For instance, why do humans not have an active uricase enzyme? Did other components of the urate pathway co-adapt to the loss of functional uricase? We will apply evolutionary analyses to reveal the molecular paths that shaped the evolution of gene families responsible for urate metabolism. Our research focuses on uricase, xanthine oxidoreductase and urate transporter-1 proteins from both modern and ancient organisms. Research will consist of sequencing these genes from modern organisms, inferring and synthesizing ancestral forms of these genes, and performing biochemical and cellular assays in order to reveal how the functions of these proteins have changed during evolutionary history. This multidisciplinary approach will expand our basic understanding of enzyme evolution and metabolic co-adaptation, and allow us to improve uricase therapeutics. Current uricase therapeutics are highly limiting due to poor solubility at plasma pH and strong immunogenicity when presented to human patients. Our preliminary data demonstrate that particular ancient uricases are substantially more soluble in rodent models and less immunogenic when presented to activated human T-cells. We are confident that our novel uricases will lead the development of next-generation therapeutics that treat gout and prevent tumor lysis syndrome."
"9693549","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will use quantitative genetic techniques to identify genes and alleles that influence a constellation of psychologically complex behavioral phenotypes that are associated with drug abuse. Our center capitalizes on a number of recent advances in study design, next-generation sequencing and statistical methods that together create an exceptional opportunity. Whereas the past two decades have seen enormous advances in both forward (phenotype to genotype) and reverse (genotype to phenotype) genetic studies in mice, there has been much less progress developing and applying the same techniques in rats. Although both forward and reverse genetic studies in mice have been extremely fruitful, many important but complex psychological processes are difficult or impossible to study in mice. For this reason we are proposing to adapt a variety of genetic techniques that we have already used successfully in mice, for behavioral studies in rats. In the current application, we propose to employ state-of-the-art tools to elucidate the genetic basis of a variety of behaviors that are relevant to drug abuse in 4,800 rats. A key strength of our center is that we utilize a unique rat heterogeneous stock (HS). These rats, sometimes referred to as N/NIH, are an HS that was created in 1984 by intercrossing 8 inbred rat strains and have been maintained as an outbred population for 65 generations. This has given rise to numerous accumulated recombinations that make them an ideal resource for performing studies that are analogous to human genome wide association studies (GWAS). Significantly, all 8 inbred founder strains have recently been re-sequenced, identifying 7.2 million SNPs. We will genotype these rats using an innovative next-generation sequencing-based method that provides ~100K SNPs at an extremely low cost. We will use these data to infer haplotypes, which will allow us to impute all 7.2 million SNPs in each rat. In addition to identifying associations between these SNPs and the behavioral traits, we will also examine gene expression in 72 behaviorally naive rats focusing on 4 key brain regions. We will use these data to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We will then integrate all of these data to identify specific genes that influece behavior. Many of the behavioral domains being studied are known to be sexually dimorphic; our study will use both male and female rats, which will allow us to identify sex differences and sex by genotype interactions. We will also identify co-heritability among these traits, as well as pleiotropic effects of individual loci on multiple putatively related behavioral domains.  Finally,  the proposed center includes numerous educational, career development and public outreach activities. We will implement a program to train high school and undergraduate students. In addition, technicians, graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty will receive career development advice in the form of individual development plans and research performance progress reports. Finally, we will engage in public outreach programs that will draw on diverse communities in Chicago, Buffalo and Memphis."
"9487034","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objectives of this proposal are to elucidate the mechanism of action of different classes of next generation ?-secretase modulators (GSMs), to determine their synergistic effect, and to apply them in examining the role of A?42, A?38 and A?37 in amyloid pathology, synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. The development of GSMs that suppress ?-secretase activity for A?42 production and yet do not affect overall APP processing and cleavages of other substrates has emerged as a promising strategy for AD therapy. Progress in the development of these clinical candidates depends on a deeper understanding of the drug-target interactions. To this end we propose to map the binding site of acid GSMs within the ?-secretase complex and to investigate the structural basis of ?-secretase modulation. Additionally, we will determine the mechanism of cooperatively between the ?-secretase active site and the imidazole based GSM binding site(s). Finally, we will examine the synergistic effect of two classes of GSMs in cellular and animal models with a focus on safety, synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. The proposed research will provide mechanistic insights into GSM modulation of ?-secretase, the function of A? in disease and new therapeutic strategies, shaping our understanding of GSM selectivity and advancing our ability to design effective treatment."

The clinical features of these patients were published as a case series in the Lancet and serve as the initial description of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This seminal discovery launched a long and productive history of ARDS research in Denver. We have been a member of the ARDS Network since its inception in 1994. Our multi-disciplinary and collaborative critical care research group is experienced in conducting high quality multi-center clinical trials. As a result, we have always been one of the top enrolling ARDS Network sites for over 19 years. The University of Colorado's Department of Emergency Medicine was one of the first residency training programs in Emergency Medicine and remains one of most highly regarded training programs in the country. Their extramural funding has grown rapidly in the past decade especially in the area of critical care research. The Division of Pulmonary Sciences and Critical Care Medicine and the Department of Emergency Medicine have an established record of effective collaborations in both patient-oriented and research initiatives. Building on this ARDS Network research infrastructure, we will create an integrated Critical Care and Emergency Medicine clinical center to effectively conduct clinical trials for the prevention and early treatment of acute lung injury. This Colorado PETAL Clinical Center will exceed meet our enrollment obligations; maintain excellence in the quality of protocol compliance, data acquisition, and regulatory responsibilities; actively participate and contribute to the subsequent responsibilities of the steering and other PETAL committees; and contribute to the improved care of patients with and at risk for ARDS."
"9693555","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Personal and group characteristics that place some individuals at higher risk of engaging in prescription drug misuse compared to their peers have been established; however, among those who misuse, researchers have not systematically discovered in-the-moment antecedents of misuse behavior in real-world environments or tracked misuse over time to understand the longer-term consequences of misuse. There is a critical need to correct these knowledge gaps because, until we do so, society's ability to prevent young adults?who display the highest misuse rates and experience increasingly costly health and well-being impacts?from misusing prescription drugs will likely remain beyond reach. The long-term goal is to reduce the occurrence of prescription drug misuse among young adults. The objective in this application is to identify factors that predict college students' misuse in the moment and determine consequences of their prescription drug misuse on health and well-being across two years. The central hypothesis is that contextual information from the moment when misuse occurs and tracking of misuse over time are crucial for understanding the immediate predictors and longer-term consequences of prescription drug misuse. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding misuse in the moment and assessing outcomes over time will provide a strong evidence-based framework to guide targeted intervention efforts aimed at reducing this hazardous substance behavior during a developmental period deemed foundational for successful adulthood. The overall objective for this project will be attained by pursuing the following two specific aims: 1) Identify momentary factors (e.g., behaviors, emotions, situations) that predict real-time prescription drug misuse; and 2) Determine the extent to which prescription drug misuse over time alters trajectories of health and well-being outcomes. Building on the investigative team's recent preliminary data that indicate strong feasibility and utility of collecting momentary reports of prescription drug misuse in daily life, 355 individuals oversampled for elevated risk of prescription misuse will complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA) procedures for 28 days. The design consists of signal-based (scheduled across the day) and event-based (self-initiated at moments when misuse is about to occur) prompts. EMA will collect ratings of theoretically-driven contextual triggers and real-time prescription drug misuse in day-to-day environments. EMA and survey data will be collected during T1. Follow-up sessions conducted every 6 months across the next 2 years (i.e., T2, T3, T4, T5) will track prescription drug misuse over time and collect important health and well-being outcomes. Quantitative modeling will be employed to identify real-time predictors of prescription drug misuse in college students' daily lives and document how prescription drug misuse alters their developmental trajectories, accounting for other substance use and appropriate controls. These contributions will be significant because a person-focused and contextual understanding of prescription drug misuse is expected to have broad translational importance in basic and applied fields."
"9480006","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a degenerative muscle disorder characterized by a lack of dystrophin expression that ultimately results in cardiac or respiratory failure. DMD patients also acquire osteopenia, fragility fracture, and scoliosis indicating that a deficiency in skeletal system homeostasis also occurs in DMD patients. It is speculated that these skeletal abnormalities are likely a secondary consequence to muscle loss (sarcopenia); however, it remains unclear if they could be due to a direct intrinsic skeletal defect. Recent evidence has emerged implicating adult stem cell dysfunction in the histopathogenesis of DMD. Muscle derived progenitor cells (MPCs) isolated from dystrophin/utrophin double knock-out (dKO) mice (a severe animal model of DMD) have been found to be defective in their proliferation and differentiation capacities. We, and others, have reported that these dKO mice exhibit a spectrum of degenerative changes in their bone, articular cartilage, and intervertebral discs and experience spinal deformities, heterotopic ossification, cardiomyopathy and a decreased lifespan, all of which support a premature musculoskeletal aging phenotype in this mouse model. A defect in bone healing was also observed in these mice; however, it is still unclear whether this defect is an intrinsic bone healing problem or associated with the secondary effects of sarcopenia (Aim 1). Preliminary evidence supports the existence of an adult stem cell defect in both MPCs and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in these mice, supporting the theory that abnormal bone healing could be the consequence of an autonomous defect in the adult stem cell compartment. Thus the second aim of this project will be to further validate whether the MPCs and MSCs in these mice, analyzed at different ages, are defective in their proliferation and osteogenic differentiation capacities compared to MPCs and MSCs isolated from mdx and wild type (WT) mice. It has recently been shown that reducing fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) activity prevents stem cell depletion/exhaustion; therefore, we also propose to determine whether FGF2 inhibitor-loaded biomimetic coacervate could rescue this autonomous adult stem cell defect and delay the onset of bone related histopathologies in dKO mice (Aim 2). Since there is also evidence that the stem cell niche may also negatively impact adult stem cell function, via a non-autonomous mechanism, we propose experiments to determine if the bone defect observed in dKO mice can be rescued through parabiotic pairing which will rejuvenate the dystrophic microenvironment by creating a shared circulation between a dKO and a young WT animal (Aim 3). We have preliminary data that supports the fact that circulating factors from young animals have a beneficial effect on the bone morphologies and healing capacity of dKO mice. In summary, this innovative grant application will: 1) determine whether the bone abnormalities and healing in dKO mice represent an intrinsic bone defect and 2) characterize whether the progressive bone histopathology observed in the dKO mice, is primarily driven by cell autonomous and/or non-autonomous mechanisms."
"9438447","Several recent studies indicate that loss of function (LoF) mutations in the apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) gene offer protection from coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, possibly by reducing circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs). Inhibition of the apoC-III pathway can provide an attractive therapeutic mechanism to lower CHD risk. There are however many outstanding uncertainties that exist, including impact of apoC-III deficiency on (i) lipoprotein kinetics; (ii) high density lipoprotein remodeling and functionality; (iii) non-lipid related pathways; (iv) the mechanisms by which apoC-III inhibition may reduce CHD risk, (v) the relative contribution of different lipoprotein- associated apoC-III levels on CHD; (vi) liver function and insulin resistance from a safety perspective.  In this application, we propose studies to address these gaps by leveraging natural human models of apoC-III deficiency. We have identified the world?s first humans with homozygous APOC3 genetic deficiency who are from an isolated Pakistani village with a high prevalence of consanguinity. Recruitment of all inhabitants in this village (~5000 people) has already been completed; genotyping in a subset has already identified 113 APOC3 knockouts with complete apoC-III deficiency providing opportunities for detailed phenotyping.  Specifically, in AIM-1, we will conduct deep phenotyping studies in 113 human APOC3 knockouts (n = 113) and in an equal number of heterozygotes and non-carriers to address the following: (i) role of apoC-III deficiency in modulating protein and lipid composition of TRLs to impact the activity of extracellular lipases; (ii) effect of apoC-III deficiency on subclasses of LDL; (iii) role of apoC-III in modulating Lp(a) levels and composition; and (iv) contribution of apoC-III deficiency to modulation of HDL composition and function. We will also address the consequences of genetic APOC3 deficiency on (iv) systemic lipid and glucose metabolism and a range of proteins related to inflammation and other pathways (v) dose-response association with atherosclerosis.  In AIM-2, we will conduct lipoprotein kinetic studies using isotope tracers on 18 trios of APOC3 null homozygotes, heterozygotes, and non-carriers to evaluate the impact of apoC-III deficiency on kinetics of apoB- containing lipoproteins and production and clearance of HDL apoA-I. We will also generate human iPS cells from 5 APOC3 knockouts and 5 matched/related non-carriers and differentiate them into hepatocytes to evaluate (a) VLDL apoB and TG production (b) TRL and LDL uptake and (c) SRB1 mediated HDL uptake.  In AIM-3, we will measure total plasma apoC-III and lipoprotein-associated (apoB lipoproteins, HDL, and Lp[a]) apoC-III in 5,000 participants from the EPIC-Norfolk cohort (2,500 with incident CHD events). These studies will enable assessment of: (i) disease mediation; (ii) CHD risk progressively adjusted for lipoprotein-associated apoC-III levels and other factors; (iii) dose-response association; (iv) relevance of apoC-III in subgroups (e.g., by T2D); (v) risk prediction beyond traditional CHD risk factors; and (vi) genetic loci associated with apoC-III levels."
"9476795","Project Summary  Gastrulation is the fundamental event during embryogenesis that generates the three primary germ layers from the pluripotent epiblast. To understand this intricate process, it is essential to use systems-based approaches to elucidate the genetic regulatory network that controls the tightly coordinated events of patterning, differentiation, and morphogenesis that take place during gastrulation. In this application, we will use sophisticated computational tools for the de novo reconstruction of regulatory networks to investigate mouse gastrulation. In our preliminary studies, we have generated a genetic regulatory network (interactome) for mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSC) using unbiased reverse-engineering approaches. Using gene expression signatures generated from peri-gastrulation mouse embryos, we have interrogated the EpiSC interactome to identify candidate master regulators of gastrulation, as well as cis-regulatory sequence motifs and cognate transcription factors that are likely to be active during gastrulation. Therefore, based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that our systems approach can identify novel master regulators of key biological processes during mouse gastrulation.  We will now pursue a comprehensive analysis of the genetic regulatory network that governs mouse gastrulation through three linked specific aims: (1) Identification of master regulators of mouse epiblast during gastrulation by unbiased systems analyses using signatures from peri-gastrulation mouse embryos to interrogate the EpiSC interactome for the identification of candidate master regulators, followed by functional validation studies; (2) Analysis of the transcriptional network that regulates mouse gastrulation by computational identification and experimental validation of cis-regulatory motifs and cognate transcription factors that are likely to function in gastrulation; and (3) Functional analyses of the regulatory network for gastrulation by testing the inferred regulatory network and biological functions of master regulators using signatures from mouse mutants that are defective in gastrulation, and by performing loss-of-function analyses of candidate master regulators in mouse embryos in vivo. Taken together, these studies will provide novel mechanistic insights into a central biological process that is essential for proper embryonic development, and whose perturbation can lead to major congenital defects."
"9475176","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Hyperphosphorylated tau is the primary component of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism associated with chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Since accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) correlates with the onset of cognitive symptoms, we aim to evaluate and validate inhibition of cytosolic histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), which modulates the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, as a lead strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative tauopathies. We seek to target HDAC6, through the use of a novel blood-brain-barrier-permeable inhibitor, as a means to delay emergence of tau pathology. We have already identified HDAC6 as a highly drug-able target and present new evidence that inhibiting HDAC6 leads to hyperacetylation and enhanced degradation of tau. We propose that acetylation of tau within KXGS motif regions (detectable with our novel site-specific antibody ac-KIGS), which are critical for tau to bind microtubules, counter balances phosphorylation on this same motif (recognized by 12E8). Given that tau species phosphorylated on KXGS motifs accumulate in neurofibrillary tangles, fail to bind and stabilize microtubules, and are not recognized by cellular degradation machinery, we hypothesize that loss of HDAC6 activity will increase the ratio of acetylation to phosphorylation on KXGS motifs to favor tau clearance, thereby preventing neuropathology and disease progression. There are no obvious, known counter indications regarding HDAC6 inhibition: HDAC6 knockout mice exhibit no overt deleterious phenotypes; we have not observed obvious toxicity with our lead HDAC6 inhibitors in cells or in mice; and selective inhibition of HDAC6 versus other HDAC isoforms has been shown to preserve normal gene expression in cells, thereby minimizing toxicity to patients. As such, we envision the use of HDAC6 modulation, in concert with the advent of techniques designed to detect and image amyloid beta peptide (Ab) pathology years to decades before the onset of cognitive symptoms, as a means to interrupt the development and progression of p-tau accumulation initially triggered by Ab deposition. In so doing, we aim to provide a greater understanding of the value of HDAC6 inhibition in slowing the onset or progression of tauopathies and, upon completion, will deliver a very compelling data package to warrant further clinical development of this novel therapeutic strategy for AD and other tauopathies."
"9620880","Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a major opportunistic pathogen and the leading infectious disease- related cause of death among people living with HIV worldwide. Shorter TB treatment regimens are urgently needed to minimize drug interactions with antiretroviral drugs, improve medical adherence, and curb the emergence of TB drug resistance. The prolonged duration of TB treatment is believed to reflect the unique ability of a subpopulation of bacteria to remain in a non-replicating, persistent state in the infected host. These ?persister? bacteria evade immune-based clearance mechanisms and become tolerant to first-line anti-TB drugs, which more effectively target actively dividing bacteria. One of the important mechanisms by which persisters acquire this phenotype is through induction of the stringent response. The stringent response enzyme RelMtb is required for bacterial growth restriction and antibiotic tolerance, and is essential for long-term Mtb survival during various in vitro and in vivo stress conditions. Deficiency of relMtb renders Mtb more sensitive to isoniazid in various models. We have generated a therapeutic DNA vaccine targeting Mtb stringent response genes, which induces antigen-specific cellular immunity, and, when combined with the first-line drug isoniazid, exhibits significantly greater activity against Mtb in the lungs of chronically infected mice relative to isoniazid alone. We also have developed a novel vaccination strategy involving fusion of the antigen of interest with the dendritic cell-targeting chemokine MIP3?, which significantly enhances immunogenicity. This vaccine platform is designed to address the fact that in addition to the T-cell deficiencies of HIV infection, there is clear documentation of deficiency of DC function in both the TB and HIV settings. However, it remains to be determined if enhanced immunity to Mtb persistence factors can shorten the duration of curative antibiotic treatment in the immune-competent and T-cell-deficient host. In the current proposal, we will directly address these knowledge gaps by testing the novel hypothesis that enhanced cellular immunity against Mtb stringent response factors potentiates the activity of the first-line anti-TB regimen and accelerates cure in the standard murine model of TB. Since HIV infection is associated with disturbed T-cell homeostasis, including depletion of CD4+ T cells and persistent expansion of CD8+ T cells, we will characterize the contribution of each of these cell types to the therapeutic efficacy of the stringent response vaccine in mice. This proposal represents a unique collaboration between Investigators with significant expertise in microbiology, molecular biology, immunology, DNA vaccines, and animal models. Our findings are expected to inform future studies investigating therapeutic TB vaccines, and lay the groundwork for the development of novel strategies to therapeutically target Mtb persisters, with the goal of shortening treatment for drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB in HIV-infected and uninfected individuals."
"9492725","PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Rhee's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator in patient-oriented clinical and translational research dedicated to improving the lives of patients with vasculitis. She will build upon her current skills in clinical epidemiology and gain critical experience in the conduct of prospective patient-oriented research, use of deep sequencing methods, and implementation of bioinformatics and advanced epidemiologic methods. Through the K23 award, the execution of the proposed study, and career development activities, Dr. Rhee will acquire the skills and training needed to make important scientific advances in rheumatology. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; Wegener's) is a systemic granulomatous vasculitis which often affects the upper respiratory tract and frequently relapses. Prior studies demonstrated that microbes in the nares are associated with relapse in GPA but these studies relied on culture-dependent approaches. Advances in high- throughput sequencing and the development of new tools for analyzing metagenomic data now allow for a better understanding of the complex relationship between the dynamic community of microbes that occupy our mucosal tissues and the host's immune system. We hypothesize that patients with GPA have greater dysbiosis (disruption in indigenous microbiota) in the nares compared to controls and that greater dysbiosis is associated with disease activity in GPA, mediated by an increase in neutrophil activity (a key pathogenic cell in GPA). The Specific Aims are: 1) compare the nasal microbiome between patients with GPA versus controls, and 2) examine longitudinal changes in the nasal microbial composition of patients with GPA and the association of these changes with gene expression profiles in the nasal epithelium and clinical outcomes. A better understanding of the complex microbial interactions with the mucosal immune system in GPA can advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of GPA, help predict future relapse, and inform the development of novel therapeutics. Findings from this study will be applied to applications for funding (R01 and others) to perform large-scale studies of host-microbe interactions in GPA. In order to successfully execute the proposed study and develop a career studying host-microbe interactions in rheumatic diseases, Dr. Rhee and her mentors have formed a comprehensive career development plan which draws upon the expertise of her mentors and the rich resources available at Penn. Dr. Rhee will engage in formal didactics including completion of the Biomedical Informatics Certificate Program, participate in relevant seminars and conferences, and devote at least 75% of her effort to research. Guided by expert mentors and collaborators, the research and training activities outlined in this application will enable Dr. Rhee to grow from an observational epidemiologist into an independent patient-oriented clinical and translational researcher, equipping her with a much larger set of skills to answer important and novel questions about vasculitis."
"9506302","Project Summary/Abstract The success of any bacterial pathogen ultimately depends on its ability to multiply and transmit to new hosts. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of the human disease tuberculosis and one of the most successful pathogens in human history, likely also employs sophisticated means to spread from one person to the next, including mediating caseation, tissue destruction, and airborne transmission. Yet, despite the toll Mtb has taken on world health, the molecular mechanisms responsible for Mtb transmission remain elusive. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that Mtb strains representing specific lineages are more prevalent in humans. Differences in virulence of specific strains have been proposed to account for the spread of specific strains. However, whether there are differences in transmission and associated factors such as cough induction and aerosolization of bacteria is unknown. These mechanisms may also account for the spread of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug resistant. Thus, there is an urgent need to better characterize the transmission dynamics of Mtb. Historical data is consistent with airborne transmission of Mtb by infected to non-infected guinea pigs. Recently, a mouse model of tuberculosis using the C3HeB/FeJ mouse strain has demonstrated pathologic feature similar to human disease such as caseation and cavitation, suggesting that these animals may also be able to produce Mtb-containing aerosols. Thus, using both guinea pigs and C3HeB/FeJ mice, we will apply bioengineering, microbiology and animal models to characterize Mtb transmission. In the proposed research we will (1) Construct a sophisticated Mtb transmission system to measure transmission, cough and aerosolized particles safely and quantitatively and (2) Use the system to compare the transmissibility of a variety of Mtb species with known differences in worldwide prevalence and innate virulence. The proposed work is expected to identify novel factors associated with transmission, and create a simple, cheap and portable system for future transmission studies that will include comparisons of drug-sensitive to drug-resistant Mtb."
"9506547","PROJECT SUMMARY For several decades, researchers have studied the neural mechanisms of spatial attention (i.e., the enhancement of neural activity for specific spatial locations) and target similarity (i.e., the enhancement of neural activity for specific inputs that look like a search target) in prefrontal cortex. The vast majority of this research has been carried out with tasks using impoverished stimuli?typically a small number of targets and distractors that abruptly flash against a uniform background. This is very different from sensory stimulation in natural environments, where boundaries between objects are less clear, the background is more complex, and most objects remain relatively static. Furthermore, artificial search tasks typically require just one saccade to a rewarding target, while natural search behavior consists of many saccades, each with different strategic goals (e.g., to explore and find potential targets, or to exploit known targets). It is currently not known how attention operates in these natural conditions. Therefore, the overarching goal of this research is to understand how attention is allocated in the real world. Neural activity from the prefrontal cortex (frontal eye fields) will be recorded while monkeys perform search tasks at different levels of abstraction from natural scene search. Specifically, the goal Aim 1 is to determine how the spectrum of saccadic strategies during natural scene search (e.g., explore or exploit) influences the allocation of attention. While monkeys freely search for a target embedded in a background of patterned noise, the allocation of attention will be flexibly and continuously sampled by rapidly (5-10 Hz) flashing a salient probe at a random location. The goal of Aim 2 is to test whether a map of target-similarity is encoded in prefrontal cortex before an object is recognized and attended spatially (i.e., target similarity guides spatial selection), or whether it is dependent upon prior allocation of spatial attention toward a detected object. This will be accomplished by constraining saccadic behavior while providing naturalistic sensory stimulation. The monkeys will be trained to detect and discriminate a target that gradually emerges from a noisy background. The target will be psychophysically detectable before the monkey detects it, allowing us to test whether FEF encodes target similarity even when spatial selection has not occurred. Together, these experiments will provide key insights into the dynamics of spatial attention and target similarity when sensory stimulation is natural and saccadic search behavior is unconstrained."
"9478532","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a destructive inflammatory joint disease associated with increased morbidity and mortality. While biologic therapies have improved treatment responses, many unmet clinical needs remain due to the refractory nature of RA, the high cost of these drugs, and the tendency of the disease to flare despite aggressive treatment. During the previous funding period, we discovered that prior to arthritic knee flare in TNF-Tg mice, the adjacent popliteal lymph node (PLN) expands due to the accumulation of lymph fluid and unactivated-polyclonal CD23+/CD21hi/CD1d hi B cells in inflamed nodes (Bin). New lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis) are then formed that protect the adjacent knee from joint from flare until there is a sudden loss of the lymphatic pulse along the ipsilateral axis extending to the iliac LN, resulting in PLN collapse and Bin translocation fro the follicles to the sinuses, which results in clogging of the lymphatics. Interestingly, knee synovitis that occurs during PLN collapse can be ameliorated by B cell depletion with anti-CD20 therapy, which significantly correlates with increased extrinsic lymphatic drainage without recovery of the lymphatic pulse, which is regulated by eNOS. Most recently, we observed that age-dependent PLN collapse is associated with lymphatic endothelium (LE) and smooth muscle (SM) damage from chronic inflammation driven by iNOS producing macrophages that attach to the luminal surface. Serendipitously, we also found that similar LE-SM damage is induced by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CE-US) in young TNF-Tg mice, which induces PLN collapse never seen in animals <4-months of age. Thus, we hypothesize that: 1) RA flare mediated by loss of efferent lymphatic flow is due to unrepaired LE-SM damage that compromises the lymphatic vessel barrier allowing squelching of the eNOS driven lymphatic pulse by NO- from iNOS expressing macrophages in the lumen. 2) Selective iNOS inhibition ameliorates arthritic flare secondary to PLN collapse by restoring the lymphatic pulse. 3) Alternatively, arthritic flare is treatable with vasodilator therapy that opens parallel lymphatic vessels to enhance and/or restore lymphatic flow. And, 4) Increased Bin accumulation in PLN, and loss of the lymphatic pulse, occur in human RA flare. To test these hypotheses we propose three Specific Aims that will: 1) establish the role of LE-SM damage/repair and NO- squelching of the lymphatic pulse in PLN collapse and knee flare in TNF-Tg mice; 2) demonstrate the efficacy of selective iNOS and PDE5 inhibitors on arthritic flare in TNF-Tg mice; and 3) provide clinical evidence that Bin accumulation and loss of the efferent lymphatic pulse occurs in human RA flare. As this research program has and will continue to provided paradigm changing information on the mechanisms of RA flare and novel therapies for this condition, the potential impact could be huge in terms of new interventions for refractory disease."
"9570698","ABSTRACT: INVESTIGATOR DEVELOPMENT CORE Pilot projects are a critical step in the research process. They provide information on the likely success of study methods, the burden to participants, and the time and resources needed to complete specific tasks. However, early stage investigators often have little training in effective research processes. As a result, the pilot funding period may end before all pilot project tasks have been completed. In our previous work, we established a Research Consult Service to assist investigators in refining research questions and methods, obtaining funding, addressing challenges in completing research tasks, and interpreting and disseminating findings. We developed and published a conceptual framework to guide the work of this Consult Service. The framework envisions assistance as progressing through sequential phases that involve publicizing availability, determining needs, providing assistance, referring to outside resources when necessary, monitoring progress, and evaluating outcomes. We also established a Community-Based Research Network (CBRN) consisting of community organizations working on collaborative research projects that are relevant to their organizations. We now propose to use the Research Consult Service, conceptual framework, and CBRN to develop and manage a pilot project program that is consistent with and synergistic to the theme of our proposed NIMHD Center of Excellence, i.e. involving communities in delivering and disseminating health disparity interventions. Specifically, we will i) publicize the availability of pilot grants; ii) help early stage investigators develop competitive applications; iii) utilize an online system for submission and rigorous review of applications; and iv) provide assistance, oversight, and evaluation to awardees. This pilot project program will focus on our institution's post-doctoral fellows, junior faculty, and early stage investigators, particularly those from underrepresented groups in order to develop a diverse workforce for conducting health disparities research. Both our Research Consult Service and our CBRN will meet regularly with awardees, provide assistance in completing project tasks, monitor progress, create innovative learning opportunities, and help them prepare for subsequent projects and grant applications. Awardees will also be active participants in other research, educational, and dissemination activities organized by the Center of Excellence. This pilot project program will develop investigators with a high capacity to engage in partnerships with communities, will expand the scientific workforce in the thematic focus area of the Center of Excellence, and will contribute to best practices on assisting early stage investigators to successfully complete pilot projects."
"9579793","ABSTRACT  This research project is to study a putative ovarian cancer progenitor and stem cell population, and the impact of menopause on the potential for the cells to undergo transformation. We have made a surprising discovery that a mosaic subpopulation of ovarian and fallopian tube epithelial cells is derived from MISR2 (Mullerian inhibitory substance receptor type 2) lineage. Furthermore these cells of MISR2-derived subpopulation have high proliferative potential and develop epithelial tumors in mice that ovarian follicles are depleted.  Based on our recent studies (published and unpublished), we have developed a unique hypothesis that the MISR2-derived subpopulation of ovarian and fallopian tube epithelial cells are epithelial stem cells and precursors of ovarian cancer. Additionally, these cells are responsive to suppression by MIS/AMH (Mullerian inhibitory substance/anti-Mullerian hormone) produced by granulosa cells of ovarian follicles.  We plan to test these ideas by studying the MISR2-containing ovarian and fallopian tube epithelial cells for their growth and stem cell properties, and also study their response to the MIS factor, in both mouse models and human cells and tissues. Previously, we found that ovarian follicles and granulosa cells produce a growth inhibitory factor(s) towards ovarian epithelial cells in culture, and provided evidence that MIS is a strong candidate for the factor. We will seek to identify the factor(s) produced by granulosa cells using a transwell device for co-culturing of ovarian and fallopian tube epithelial cells with granulosa cells, and to verify if MIS contributes to part or all of the inhibitory activity. Experiments designed are also to test the roles of the MIS/MISR2 paracrine/endocrine pathway in maintaining the tissues homeostasis of the ovarian and fallopian tube environment, and in tumor suppression, as summarized in two main aims. The first major aim is to characterize the MISR2-positive cells to determine if these cells are progenitor/stem cell like, and precursors for ovarian cancer. The second major aim is to identify the tumor suppressing factor(s) produced by follicles/granulosa cells and to study its regulation of ovarian epithelial cells in ovarian tissue homeostasis. Granulosa cell-derived MIS will be tested as a strong candidate of the follicle-derived factor.  The experiments will use human ovarian cancer tissues, primary and established cells, and transgenic mutant mouse models to study molecular mechanisms and relevance to human ovarian tissue and cancer. The findings and conclusions from the study of cell and mouse models will be verified in human normal and cancer tissues.  If successful, our work will solve the long-standing puzzle for the reason why ovarian cancer risk is high in menopausal women. The research will also gain insight into an ovarian epithelial and cancer stem cell population, and will yield a substantial new advance in ovarian cancer biology."
"9476182","Project Summary / Abstract  Bipolar disorder (BD) is the Axis I psychiatric condition most strongly associated with substance use disorder (SUD); diagnostic co-occurrence is particularly high between BD and alcohol use disorder (AUD). Individuals with co-occurring SUD and BD (SUD+BD) have substantially worse clinical outcomes than those with either BD or SUD alone. Nonetheless, little is known about optimal treatment for individuals with SUD+BD; response to lithium appears to be poor, and only one double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of valproate has demonstrated improved drinking outcomes in this population. Traditionally, treatment trials for SUD+BD have investigated medications that have been FDA approved to treat either BD or SUD in hopes that such medications would prove efficacious in individuals with SUD+BD. A different approach to selecting, and ideally developing, medications for SUD+BD treatment trials would be to target neurochemical dysfunctions characteristic of individuals with both BD and SUD. Our lab recently demonstrated unique disturbances in prefrontal gamma- Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate concentrations in this population using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), with individuals with co-occurring alcohol dependence (AD) and BD having significantly lower levels of GABA and glutamate relative to individuals with BD alone, AD alone, or healthy controls. Lower levels of prefrontal GABA and glutamate were in turn associated with elevated impulsivity and alcohol craving. The proposed 3-week, double-blind, crossover, proof of concept study will evaluate: a) whether medications that have been demonstrated to normalize cortical GABA (i.e., gabapentin) and glutamate (i.e., N-Acetylcysteine [NAC]) concentrations in individuals with epilepsy and cocaine dependence, respectively, may similarly act to normalize prefrontal GABA and glutamate levels in individuals with AUD+BD, and b) whether normalization of prefrontal GABA and glutamate levels will be associated with improvements in functional brain activity to tasks that assess core neurobehavioral deficits of AUD and BD (i.e., response inhibition, alcohol cue-reactivity), as well as drinking and mood symptoms. Positive results may support investigation of gabapentin and/or NAC as adjunctive treatments for AUD+BD in large-scale, randomized clinical trials. Most importantly, the proposed study may provide successful demonstration of a neuro-behavioral, multimodal neuroimaging platform for evaluating the potential promise of GABAergic and glutamatergic drugs for AUD and/or BD, as well as other conditions marked by GABAergic/glutamatergic dysfunction."
"9615120","ToxR is a transmembrane transcription factor required by Vibrio cholerae to colonize the human intestine and cause disease, and its operon partner ToxS is required both to protect ToxR from premature degradation as well as for full ToxR activity. ToxR is active as a dimer, and the periplasmic domain has been shown to be required for dimerization. Whereas these results were obtained using microbiological approaches, our laboratory has employed a biochemical approach using purified domains to demonstrate the periplasmic domains of ToxR and ToxS interact. Furthermore, we have shown that bile salts activate ToxR by increasing the interaction between the two periplasmic domains, while at the same time destabilizing the ToxR periplasmic domain. Building off these results, our laboratory has recently purified a ToxR periplasmic domain containing an intra-chain disulfide bond, which appears to be monomeric, in contrast to the previously purified ToxR periplasmic domain, purified without a disulfide bond, which was dimeric. This existence of a stable, monomeric form of ToxR indicates its periplasmic domain is dynamic, undergoing a transition in response to bile salts from an inactive monomer to an active dimer that binds ToxS.  In the first aim of this proposal, the dynamics of the ToxR periplasmic domain when exposed to bile salt induced stress will be explored. The recently purified ToxR periplasmic domain with an intra-chain disulfide bond will be used to monitor the transition from monomer to dimer forms. This will be achieved by first determining the structure of the domain by X-ray crystallography or NMR, and then by using NMR to examine if bile salts can bind it specifically. The residues important for binding bile salts and the ToxR dimer interface will be identified by either NMR or by cross-linking mass spectrometry. Once the interface is identified, the amino acids at the interface will be altered, and their effects on ToxR activity will be determined using an OmpT/U reporter assay.  ToxS has been presumed to only bind ToxR. However, ToxS is more conserved across Vibrio species than ToxR, indicating it may have other biological roles. Furthermore, alignments of the ToxS periplasmic domain reveals three conserved modules connected by variable linkers. These features suggest the domain is composed of independent subdomains and that ToxS might bind other ligands. To test this hypothesis, we will synthesize all possible subdomain combinations and test their activity in vivo using the OmpT/U reporter as a marker for ToxR activity. The subdomain constructs will be tested for their ability to interact with purified ToxR periplasmic domain and the ToxR/ToxS binding interface will be identified using biophysical methods. Next, the ToxS periplasmic domain will be tested for binding to cyclic-di-peptides and bile salts, small molecules that are reported or known to effect ToxR activity. Finally, potential ToxS binding proteins will be identified by pulling down a tagged-ToxS under various conditions, and identifying the pulled down proteins by mass spectrometry."
"9452609","Project Summary Oscillations in the brain, spanning several orders of magnitude in frequency range, may form a system that provides a syntactical framework for packaging information into `neuronal letters, words and sentences' (4). Olfaction is arguably at the forefront of understanding the role of oscillations in sensory perception (6-18). Indeed, studies in awake behaving animals show efficient odor quality coding by tiling of the response on the sniff phase (21-24). However, as indicated by Uchida and co-workers (14), whether tiling in the oscillatory phase does code for odor quality, or intensity at a certain frequency of firing, is still open to question. Interestingly, oscillations likely play a role in conveying information on odor valence. Indeed, it has been proposed that OB ? oscillations are associated with higher cognitive processes, such as making choices or initiating actions and convey information relevant for olfactory learning (16). Thus, while the olfactory system is arguably at the forefront of understanding the role of oscillations in sensory systems, there is a need to understand the precise role of these oscillations in conveying information on odorant features and valence in the OB. We have identified a major gap in understanding neural oscillations in the OB. We postulate that, phase amplitude coupling (PAC) of the ? oscillations in the ? cycle, described in the OB by Rojas-Libano and co- workers (25), likely plays a role in transfer of sensory and valence information. We will test the hypothesis that tiling of fast oscillatory response of MCs along the phase of the slower ? oscillations, conveys odor information critical for odor discrimination and learning and we will determine whether different types of information are carried at different frequency bandwidths (? vs. low or high ?). Aim 1. Awake behaving closed loop optogenetic experiments to test the hypothesis that phase amplitude coupling facilitates olfactory discrimination. Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that transient within-trial increase in the activity of noradrenergic axons in the olfactory bulb modulate oscillatory M/T cell responsiveness resulting in enhanced discrimination of sensory input. Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that phase coupled stimulation of mitral cells at different bandwidths carry different types of odorant information."
"9570699","ABSTRACT: COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND DISSEMINATION CORE Adoption of research findings by individuals, providers, and communities is critical to improving health outcomes. However, passive diffusion of information, such as through publishing findings in scientific journals, is often ineffective in influencing practice. Active and targeted dissemination efforts, especially those that engage communities and other stakeholders, may have a greater impact. In our previous work, we engaged communities in a number of research and dissemination activities. Our Community Research Scholars Initiative increased the research capacity of community organizations. We taught 9 employees of community organizations about research methods and mentored them as they conducted research projects on topics relevant to their organizations. These organizations subsequently established a Community-Based Research Network to conduct collaborative research projects. The first collaborative project involves developing a community-academic partnership toolkit called BRACE (Building Research for Academic and Community Equity). We also established a practice-based research network of 65 northeast Ohio massage therapists and trained 32 community residents to be researchers in community-based participatory research projects. We now propose a conceptual framework-guided approach to disseminating information from the Center of Excellence?s research projects, pilot projects, and other activities. Dissemination will proceed through four phases: planning, packaging, distribution, and evaluation. The planning phase will create interactive dissemination activities that involve a two-way dialogue with stakeholders, not simply a one-way flow of information. The packaging phase will consider the language, format, accessibility, and appeal of dissemination material since these can influence utilization by target audiences. The distribution phase will determine which channels, or methods of communication, to use for distribution. These may include print material, internet-based approaches, mass media activities, and face-to-face interactions. Finally, the evaluation phase will evaluate the processes and outcomes of proposed engagement and dissemination activities. In addition, we will develop a strategic plan to translate our research findings into sustainable community and system-level changes. The proposed activities will be led by a dissemination workgroup consisting of researchers, community members, and other stakeholders. The Community Engagement and Dissemination Core will engage researchers, communities, and other stakeholders in efforts to disseminate research findings; will develop strategic planning processes to translate findings into sustainable changes; and will contribute to knowledge about best practices on disseminating health disparity research findings. !"
"9696306","Category A ? Existing States New York State PRAMS Project Abstract  The primary goal of the New York State Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is to collect high quality population based data on maternal and infant health that are not available from other sources. Data collected through the PRAMS program will help New York State address several maternal and child health services priorities identified in the state?s Prevention Agenda and in the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant for FFY 2011- 2016, PRAMS data provides important baseline information and ongoing measures of New York?s progress in addressing priorities including access and barriers to prenatal care, oral health during pregnancy, low birthweight and infant mortality, substance abuse (alcohol/tobacco) during pregnancy, unintended pregnancy and breastfeeding.  A stratified random sample of women who have recently given birth to a live born infant in New York State (excluding New York City) will be sampled from birth certificate records between 2-4 months after delivery. Approximately 140 women will be sampled on a monthly basis for a yearly sample size of 1,600 for the next five years. The sample will be stratified by birthweight (<2500g/?2500g) with oversampling of low birthweight births to ensure an adequate representation of this high risk population. PRAMS staff will work in conjunction with the New York State Department of Health?s Bureau of Production Systems Management and the Bureau of Biometrics and Health Statistics to ensure access to birth files for PRAMS sampling. Mothers will be sent up to three questionnaire mailings with telephone follow-up for non-responders. Our goal is to obtain a minimum response rate of 65%.  Findings from the PRAMS analysis will be utilized and disseminated by the state?s internal and external partners to monitor Prevention Agenda and Maternal and Child Health priorities. In addition, PRAMS data will be disseminated via dedicated PRAMS surveillance reports on the New York State Department of Health public web site to support public health policy and program improvement. The reports include selected indicators such as pregnancy intention, tobacco use, breastfeeding, and folic acid, presented by maternal demographics."
"9345106","Project Summary Heavy alcohol use in HIV-infected patients contributes to suboptimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), greater sexual risk taking, higher viral loads, and worsened liver and cognitive functioning. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to represent almost half of all HIV/AIDS cases in the United States, and heavy drinking is particularly high among this HIV-infected sub-group. Brief motivational interventions have been shown to reduce alcohol consumption among HIV-infected MSM; however, these individual-level interventions have demonstrated only modest effects in reducing drinking in this population, indicating that sustained behavior change requires attending to social and interpersonal contexts as well. To date, there are no existing brief, couples-based interventions to address heavy alcohol use among HIV-infected MSM and their primary partners that do not require alcohol abstinence treatment goals. Furthermore, there are no published data on the extent to which changes in couples alcohol use relate to key HIV-related outcomes (ART adherence, viral suppression, sexual risk). The overall aim of this project is to develop and test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a brief couples-based motivational intervention to address heavy alcohol use among HIV-infected MSM and their primary partner. This treatment development project builds on our individual-level motivational intervention (MI) with HIV- infected MSM by using components from our significant other-involved motivational intervention (SO-MI) and couples-based HIV prevention interventions, and seeks to provide insights into the mechanisms of couple-level behavior change, including motivation, individual and dyadic self-efficacy, and partner support. A two-step sequence of treatment development will be used to achieve these aims. Stage 1a includes interviews with key informants (N = 15 couples), manual development, therapist training, and a one-arm pilot with qualitative exit interviews (N = 12 couples). Stage 1b consists of a small-randomized clinical trial in which 50 heavy drinking HIV-infected MSM will be randomly assigned to either couples intervention, which involves participation of their partner, or to the existing individual intervention, which does not. Both conditions will consist of four sessions conducted over a one-month period. Participants will be interviewed at baseline, and 3-months and 6-months. Findings will provide data on the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the couples-based motivational intervention to reduce alcohol use among HIV- infected MSM and their primary partners. If this research shows initial promise, we will use findings to support an R01 application to test the intervention efficacy in a fully powered randomized controlled trial. This research could provide a foundation for improving the health of HIV-infected heavy drinking MSM."
"9471208","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is the most commonly inherited form of brittle bone disease, which is characterized by a wide-ranging severity from mild phenotypes to severe congenital lethality. OI is commonly caused by mutations in the two genes that encode type I collagen but recent studies have shed light on several recessive OI cases resulting from abnormalities in collagen synthesis, secretion and/or folding. One of the most well-studied forms of recessive is caused by mutations in the prolyl 3- hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) complex (consisting of cartilage associated protein [CRTAP], P3H1 and cyclophilin B [CypB]), which are essential for prolyl hydroxylation of type I procollagen, and failure to do so results in defective collagen cross-linking. In addition, we and others have recently identified several families that developed progressive bone fragility and congenital joint contractures (i.e. recessive OI and Bruck syndrome) due to loss-of-function mutations in FK506 binding protein 10, 65 KDa!(FKBP10), which encodes the ER-chaperone protein FKBP65. To understand the function of FKBP10, our laboratory previously generated Fkbp10-null mice which displayed connective tissue abnormalities and reduced collagen cross-linking. While the global Fkbp10 knockout mice phenocopied certain aspects of the human disease condition, they unexpectedly resulted in embryonic lethality. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to elucidate the tissue specific functions of FKBP10 in regulating tendon homeostasis. In other types of recessive OI, the biochemical modifications of collagen are altered, in particular by P3H1. Additionally, studies on Crtap knockout mice have revealed that collagen abnormalities alter cell signaling, which is the predominant mechanism underlying disease. I hypothesize that tissue-specific loss of FKBP10 negatively affects type I collagen cross-linking and alters cell signaling within the tissue microenvironment, ultimately resulting in OI and Bruck syndrome. I aim to test this hypothesis by determining the effects of tissue specific Fkbp10 removal on the molecular, biochemical, and biomechanical properties of tendons. The experiments proposed in this training plan is critical for establishing both unique and common mechanisms of disease, which may provide potential therapeutic targets for patients with OI and Bruck syndrome as well as other types of OI cases. The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) is the recipient organization of this fellowship because recessive OI and Bruck syndrome are characterized by abnormalities in both skeletal and connective tissues."
"9509355","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF) are chronic and life-threatening blistering diseases caused by autoantibodies (autoAbs) to the keratinocyte adhesion proteins desmoglein (Dsg) 3 and Dsg1. Left untreated, patients can die from severe blistering of the skin and/or mucous membranes. Current therapy relies on general immune suppression to reduce Ab production, which is effective but risks fatal infection. For example, after B cell depletion with the anti-CD20 monoclonal Ab rituximab, 95% of pemphigus patients experience short-term healing of blisters and 47% achieve complete remission of disease off therapy. However, ~80% of patients relapse, likely due to incomplete CD20+ B cell depletion, and two of 21 patients in the initial trial had serious infections, resultig in one death. Thus, the ideal therapy would eliminate only the disease-causing autoimmune B cells, sparing the vast majority of B cells that help protect against infection.  Recently, chimeri T cell receptor (TCR) technology was successfully developed at our institution for cancer therapy. A chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) consists of an extracellular Ab to a cancer antigen fused to T cell cytoplasmic signaling domains. When expressed on the patient's T cells, the CAR directs those T cells to kill antigen-expressing cancer cells and subsequently proliferate to produce memory CAR T cells, leading to complete and durable remission even in refractory cancer patients. In this proposal, we will adapt this powerful technology to engineer T cells to kil autoimmune B cells in pemphigus in order to produce complete and durable remission of autoimmune disease. B cells destined to secrete anti-Dsg3 or anti-Dsg1 Abs express surface anti-Dsg Ab, specifically marking the autoimmune B cells in pemphigus. Because the B cell surface autoAb is now the target, we reversed the typical CAR design to create a chimeric autoAb receptor (CAAR), with the Dsg antigen as the extracellular domain of the chimeric TCR. This proposal will test the hypothesis that Dsg CAARs will provide a highly effective and safe means for killing B cells expressing cell surface anti- Dsg Ab, resulting in disease remission. Completing the aims of the proposal will provide pre-clinical data to justify therapeutic trials in patients, and our unique expertise in CAR technology and pemphigus will help facilitate translation to clinical therapy. This proposal is both innovative and significant because such an approach has never been tested in autoimmune disease and, if proven effective in pemphigus, could be applied to any autoAb-mediated disease for which the target antigen is known."
"9694533","Summary/Abstract - Augmented Reality HAZMAT Sensor Simulator Phase II A goal of HAZMAT training exercises is to present learners with realistic tasks and experiences involving mock hazards, protective equipment (PPE), tools, and hazard sensors. However, while mock hazards, PPE, and tools are readily available to trainers, sensors that operate with mock hazards are not. Because the decisions that a HAZMAT worker makes are often dictated by the readings from sensors, making sensor readings and interpreting them are critical skills and the ability of a HAZMAT training program to teach these skills is significant. Cell Podium proposes to develop, in collaboration with the Rutgers School of Public Health Office of Public Health Practice, an augmented reality training system for realistic and experiential health and safety training of hazardous materials (HAZMAT) workers. The system meets key requirements assessed in Phase I. First, the system includes handheld devices that look similar to handheld chemical and radiological hazard sensors, and behave as if they were actual hazard sensors and the training hazards were real. The behavior is realistic both in terms of the exposure values displayed, themselves a function of the type of hazards in the exercise and their distance from the learner, and the response time to changes in the environment (e.g., if the instructor invokes a sudden chemical release, or if the learner quickly runs to or from a hazard). To mitigate technological risk, Phase I successfully developed and tested a proof-of- concept of the proposed system, and evaluated its performance at a Rutgers 40-hour Hazardous Waste Training course. A common practice in HAZMAT exercises is for the instructor to shout verbal descriptions of hazard exposure to the learner. This practice has several drawbacks: (1) much of the effort to make the exercise realistic to the learner is undone, (2) the skills of making, interpreting, and responding to continuous readings from handheld sensors are not rehearsed, (3) the instructor, who should be focused on advising and assessing the learner, bears the burden of serving as a prop in the simulation, and (4) the size large of the exercise, measured in either square feet or in number of concurrent participating learners, is limited by the reach of the verbal descriptions. The proposed system relieves the instructor from this burden so that s/he can focus on assessing the learners. A specific aim of the Phase II effort that cost to acquire and operate the system be low, and that it work with existing training program assets. To achieve this aim, the system hardware consists only of consumer cell phones to emulate the handheld hazard sensors, and inexpensive miniature Bluetooth beacons (under $35 each) that are placed on each mock hazard of the exercise. Two systems will be deployed during the two-year Phase II period of performance: a minimum viable product will be released at the end of the first year, and a full-featured product at the end of the second year. To obtain market feedback and promote product usage, the system will be offered for free to WTP training grantees throughout the Phase II period of performance with help support. The business opportunity for augmented reality sensors extends beyond HAZMAT training organizations into markets that conduct internal HAZMAT training including fire departments, utility companies, and military installations."
"9416708","CORE SUMMARY Core D will implement hyperspectral imaging technologies, image analysis approaches, and mathematical modeling to answer questions concerning the time course and spatial spread of cellular signals and subsequent regulation of endothelial function. Core D will support all PROJECTS by providing spectral analysis of the molecular composition of tissues, enabling quantitative imaging of localized intracellular signals and implementing novel image processing, data analysis, and mathematical modeling approaches. Service component: Core D will provide capabilities for next-generation imaging, image analysis, quantitative data extraction, mathematical modeling, and data storage and retrieval to support all projects and cores. In specific, Core D will 1) provide expertise and assistance in implementing next-generation 5-dimensional imaging (x,y,z,t,?) approaches; 2) develop customized analysis approaches for extracting localized signaling information from 5-dimensional image data; 3) assist in creating mathematical models of signaling pathways to aid in hypothesis testing and generation; and 4) manage a central repository for image and modeling data storage that will facilitate cross-project collaboration and data mining. Academic component: The investigators of Core D will continue to develop new technologies for next- generation hyperpsectral, high-speed microscopy. As these microscope systems are implemented, Core D will provide access to and training on the new imaging technologies. During the upcoming cycle, Core D will focus on implementing several high-speed hyperspectral imaging technologies that are currently in the late stages of prototype development. Access to these technologies will enable project investigators to take the next step in studying pulmonary vasculature on a cellular and biosystems level (for example, simultaneous subcellular measurements of Ca2+-cGMP-NO, or assessing cAMP in whole tissue constructs and intravitally). Synergy with projects and scientific cores: Core D will serve as a hub for project synergy by implementing cross-project quantitative imaging, analysis, and modeling approaches and by ensuring that all image and modeling data is archived and maintained in a central database (repository). The quantitative nature of 5D imaging and the ability to access data from experiments across multiple projects will further build synergy. For example, we can quantitatively assess whether Ca2+ influx through T-type channels in response to a 20 second depolarization is sufficient to modulate sAC and AC6 activity at designated subcellular locations and to effect changes in cAMP and endothelial barrier integrity. Thus, the quantitative nature of Core D provides a framework for interweaving imaging and modeling studies performed by all projects."
"9519800","Project Summary  The female skeleton undergoes dramatic physiological alterations as a result of reproduction. While weaning induces substantial bone recovery, reproduction-induced bone loss is only partially recovered after weaning. Nevertheless, most epidemiology studies report that history of reproduction and lactation had no negative, or even a protective effect on fracture risk later in life. This represents a paradox that reproduction reduces bone mass without increasing risk of future fractures. Thus, the overall objective of this study is to uncover the mechanisms that explain this paradox. Our preliminary results demonstrated that despite a lower bone mass, reproductive rats have a distinct bone structural phenotype and a much slower rate of bone loss than virgin rats when exposed to estrogen deficiency by ovariectomy (OVX). 3 months after OVX, the load bearing sites, such as vertebral trabecular bone and femoral midshaft, showed no bone loss in reproductive rats. Our data also indicated that osteocytes can actively modulate material properties of the peri-lacunar bone matrix during reproduction, which could lead to critical alterations in the micro-mechanical environment of osteocytes, the presumed mechano-sensors in bone. Indeed, our results suggested that post-reproductive rats were more sensitive to in vivo tibial loading than virgin rats. In addition, when subjected to OVX later in life, the size of osteocyte lacunae increased significantly in reproductive rats. Thus, the micro-environmental changes after reproduction may affect the skeleton's sensitivity to mechanical stimuli and impact bone quality later in life. These findings from clinical and animal studies provide a strong scientific premise for our novel, central hypothesis that history of reproduction and lactation causes skeletal adaptation at the structural, material, and cellular levels, which may protect the skeleton from estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss later in life. To test this hypothesis and determine the mechanisms behind it, we propose two aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the influence of reproduction and lactation history on skeletal responses in bone microarchitecture, cellular activities, and mechano-sensitivity to estrogen deficiency later in life. In Aim 2, we will establish the role of reproduction history on modulating lacunar and canalicular structure, peri-lacunar bone tissue modulus, and load-induced fluid flow experienced by osteocytes and their processes in both prior- and post-OVX rats. We will address an unsolved clinical paradox and elucidate the amazing adaptive mechanisms that protect women with a history of pregnancy and lactation from postmenopausal osteoporosis. Identifying the phenotypic bone structure, material properties, and osteocyte microenvironment in virgin and reproductive bone could lead to novel strategies for osteoporosis prevention, management, and treatment for postmenopausal women by considering their reproduction histories. This highly impactful research will also advance our fundamental understanding of osteocyte peri-lacunar remodeling and its regulation of bone's mechano-sensitivity."
"9457401","Project Abstract Transgender women (TW) are currently the SGM population at highest risk for HIV infection in the United States, especially those who are racial/ethnic minorities. TW also report the highest levels of discrimination, victimization, traumatic life events, and other stressful experiences and are of the highest risk groups for substance abuse and mental health problems. HIV researchers have suggested resiliency may be a largely untapped resource in behavioral interventions and that it may be associated with reductions in mental health problems, substance abuse, and HIV related risk among marginalized populations. Daily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is extremely effective in preventing HIV infection among those who are HIV-negative. While this is an exciting development for HIV prevention among minority TW, HIV prevention efforts must now shift focus to research on optimizing PrEP adherence among this high-risk population facing multiple recurring stressful life events and numerous structural barriers. In the proposed study, we will leverage an ongoing study of (N =300) racially and ethnically diverse TW enrolled in the Southern California based PrEP demonstration project, in order to conduct mixed-methods research, first using structural equation modeling (SEM) to assessing the risk and resiliency factors most associated with PrEP adherence among TW. Then using the SEM findings to inform follow-on, in-depth qualitative interviews with a sub-sample of high- to low-adherence minority TW to further explore those risk and resiliency factors and experiences most salient to PrEP adherence among high-risk minority TW. This study will provide the preliminary data to support the submission of an intervention development grant (NIDA R34) to develop a resilience-based intervention focused on improving PrEP adherence for TW."
"9432528","Abstract Genital malformation including hypospadias represents the second most common male birth defect after cardiac defect. In the past 50 years, hypospadias incidence has doubled along with other male reproductive problems. It is suspected that fetal exposure to endocrine disruptors may have contributed to this increase. However, the etiology of hypospadias is still largely unclear. Both environmental and genetic factors are involved. In fact, our understandings of genital development in general are still very limited. A complete understanding of genetic pathways governing genital development and masculinization and how perturbations of these pathways lead to genital malformations will have immense applications to improve global health. In the past few years, we have performed comprehensive genetic analyses on genital tubercle (GT) development in the mouse and established a conserved genetic pathway (Wnt/?-catenin?Sp8?Fgf8) in regulating body appendage outgrowth, including limbs and external genitalia. Genetic interactions between Wnt and Shh pathways in regulating both genitalia outgrowth and masculinization have also been described. Together, these studies laid the foundation for understanding posterior embryonic development as well as how environmental factors can influence genitalia development and cause hypospadias. Based on these findings, this proposal will continue to use mouse genetics including a series of conditional mutant mice to investigate a novel genetic pathway regulating GT outgrowth. In Aim I, We will characterize several knockout mouse models to build a genetic pathway regulating GT outgrowth and patterning. In Aim II, we will use a novel and highly innovative Split DamID technique to identify in vivo downstream targets of androgen receptor and ?-catenin during genital masculinization. Together, these studies should greatly improve our understanding of genitalia development and hypospadias formation. Our long term goal is to use mouse molecular genetics to understand the process of genital development and masculinization and the etiology of genital malformations, such as hypospadias."
"9302579","ABSTRACT  Monkey B virus (BV) is a herpesvirus common in macaque (rhesus, cynomolgus) monkeys which are an invaluable resource for biomedical research. When BV is transmitted to humans, ~80% of patients die and survivors frequently experience progressive neurological decline, making BV the single greatest zoonotic danger facing research and veterinary personnel who work with macaques. Drugs currently used to treat BV infections were developed for treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, and are all are less effective against BV than HSV. Even when treated with ganciclovir (GCV), the most effective drug, some BV patients still die. Studies in mice also suggest that the current recommended treatment protocol may be flawed, allowing undetected BV infections to invade the central nervous system, resulting in a drastically diminished chance of patient survival. Since new drugs specifically targeted at BV are unlikely to be developed due to a lack of financial incentive, therapy using existing antivirals needs to be optimized. In the proposed study drugs shown to be effective against HSV and some experimental drugs will be tested for in vivo efficacy against BV by systemic administration using a mouse model. Preliminary experiments indicate that drugs applied topically can provide protection against BV that is as effective as systemically administered drugs. In addition, cidofovir (CDV) appears to be more effective against BV than GCV (the most effective drug currently recommended for treatment of BV infections) and an experimental drug having a different mode of action than GCV or CDV is also effective against BV, raising the possibility of its use in a dual drug regimen for added treatment efficacy. These results need to be followed up with additional research to validate use of topical drug delivery as a means of preventing neurological BV infections, use of CDV to treat BV infections, and the potential efficacy of dual drug regimens. This project will produce the needed confirmatory data and test the efficacy of dual drug regimens. The results will serve as a rational scientific basis for possible modification of existing recommendations for treatment of zoonotic BV infections."

In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic Cl will be randomly assigned to 16 weeks of: 1) office-based vergence/ accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy. After 16 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome measures of reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-III] reading comprehension subtest score) and attention (Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]) will be assessed by examiners masked to treatment group. The Gates MacGinitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Reading fluency, another test of attention, the Cl Symptom Survey, and clinical measures of Cl (i.e., the near point of convergence, and positive fusional vergence at near) are other secondary outcome measures; also included are assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading comprehension including pseudoword decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension. Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention are assessed 1-year post treatment.  This application documents our site's ability to recruit at least 36 subjects and o retain them for 1 year after completion of treatment. Documentation is provided that our site has the appropriate personnel, equipment, and facilities to conduct the study in accordance with the CITT-ART Manual of Procedures (MOP). Complete details of the study rationale, design, and methods are contained in the Manual of Procedures (submitted with the Study Chair and Data Coordinating Center [DCC] applications). In addition to our center, there are 8 other optometric or ophthalmologic centers, the Study Chair at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, and the DCC at The Ohio State University Optometry Coordinating Center.  Symptomatic Cl is a common vision disorder in children that is commonly associated with symptoms while reading (e.g. loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading slowly, trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of Cl treatment on reading and attention is unknown. The results of the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and have important implications for educators, psychologists, and physicians who care for children with reading and attention problems. The findings will guide hypothesis development for future scientific investigations in children with vision disorders."
"9478553","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Macrophages represent key cellular drivers of chronic joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recently, synovial fibroblasts have also emerged as active players in this disease. Interestingly, fibroblasts and other mesenchymal stromal cells impart immunosuppressive activity in a wide-range of tissues. Here we wish to explore how rampant inflammation persists in RA despite a massive outgrowth of fibroblasts. Our preliminary evidence suggests that RA synovial fibroblasts indeed promote anti-inflammatory pathways in macrophages. In the context of the RA inflammatory milieu, we propose this results in a mixed pro-inflammatory and wound- healing macrophage phenotype. As wound-healing macrophages support fibroblast function, we are interested in whether induction of wound-healing responses in RA macrophages ultimately feeds back to support fibroblast expansion and invasiveness. This ultimately may establish a perpetual crosstalk cycle, which promotes survival of both cell types, inflammation and tissue damage. RA afflicts over 1 million Americans. Current therapies target pro-inflammatory macrophage responses. Here we propose that macrophage wound healing responses may also represent critical therapeutic targets, as these responses may promote fibroblast-mediated RA pathogenesis. The candidate obtained a PhD in immunology from Columbia University and pursued postdoctoral fellowship at Rockefeller University in epigenetics and cell signaling. She is now motivated to apply her rigorous basic science training towards establishing an academic career in clinically relevant research focused on the pathophysiology of RA. In order to meet this goal, she will conduct research in the laboratory of Lionel Ivashkiv at Hospital for Special Surgery, where she will gain significant experience working with human tissue and a deeper understanding of rheumatic diseases from the clinical perspective. Dr. Ivashkiv is a board certified rheumatologist, an expert in cytokine-mediated inflammatory responses and has trained scientists who now hold faculty positions."
"9570702","Leveraging Biocultural Mechanisms to Increase the Impact of Multi-level  Preventable Disease Interventions with Southwest Populations  Project Summary/Abstract The proposed U54 Specialized Center will advance knowledge on how to prevent cardiometabolic disease and substance abuse disorders among the health disparities populations of the Southwest. The Southwest Interdisciplinary Research Center (SIRC) has accumulated invaluable expertise in this area for the past 10 years as ASU's Exploratory Center of Excellence (NIMHD/NIH P20MD002316). The stark unmet health needs of the Southwest communities, the strong transdisciplinary team of researchers assembled for this application, and the existing solid community partnerships make this application highly significant. The Specialized Center will leverage SIRC's accumulated knowledge on cultural and social determinants of health and health disparities and will integrate biological, sociocultural and other contextual factors into efficacious, culturally grounded and impactful health interventions. We will focus on understanding the protective and risk effects of interpersonal family and household factors, the community environment, and individual health behaviors on specific biological health outcomes. The Specialized Center will extend SIRC's integrated, multilevel, social determinants approach to include biocultural mechanisms within an Ecodevelopmental Theory framework. The proposed center will significantly enhance SIRC's research impact through a research focus on preventing cardio metabolic disease and substance abuse disorders through culturally appropriate and efficacious interventions. The proposed research is innovative because it will investigate how protective and risk factors that are common to various chronic diseases and disorders manifest themselves among racial/ethnic minority populations of the Southwest, with an emphasis on the sociocultural and biological determinants of health disparities. The two proposed main research projects will target potentially modifiable youth behaviors associated with cardiometabolic disease and with substance abuse disorders (i.e., physical activity, and quality of diet, access to healthy foods, family functioning, acculturation, substance use, and illegal drug availability). The resulting findings will inform the design and testing of efficacious interventions that can strengthen protective factors and counteract risk factors operating within the multiple ecological domains of a young person's life. The center will conduct the two related main research projects to increase the impact of efficacious interventions by advancing knowledge on how cultural processes influence biological vulnerabilities (i.e., biocultural mechanisms). Early career faculty and postdocs will increase their capacity to conduct health dipartites research through a comprehensive investigator development and pilots research incubator initiative. The center will implement the research projects and future pilots in close and equitable partnership with communities of the Southwest. In partnership with the SIRC Community Advisory Board, the center will broadly disseminate and translate the knowledge generated by the studies and pilots to policy, practice, and lay stakeholders through an innovative dissemination plan."
"9690323","Project summary This is a proposal to renew a highly focused postdoctoral training program in Neurobehavioral Genetics. Elucidating the genetic basis of diseases of the nervous system promises to transform our understanding of some of the most prevalent, burdensome, and complex afflictions of humankind. The program bridges several longstanding dichotomies; between nervous system mechanisms and behavior, between neurology and psychiatry/psychology, between diseases and non-disease traits, and between humans and model organisms. The program provides exposure to the science of neurobehavioral phenotyping to individuals with basic science backgrounds. The program stresses the importance of, and provides unified training in, systematic delineation and assessment of nervous system phenotypes, including the integration of traditional clinical and cognitive evaluations with recently available phenotyping tools such as neuroimaging and gene expression profiling. The core curriculum of the program emphasizes phenotyping of the nervous system and advanced genetics, and is designed to promote interactions between the postdoctoral fellows and their counterparts in a companion predoctoral program. A new curriculum element for this renewal is an intensive practical course in ?big data?, emphasizing both the bioinformatics analysis of high-throughput sequencing data and issues involved in large-scale data sharing. The program gains cohesion by a neurogenetics seminar series and an annual program retreat. Intensive research experience with a mentor chosen by the trainee constitutes the heart of the program. The ambitious goals of the program are achievable because the program faculty is very strong in virtually all of the areas that are relevant to neurobehavioral genetics, and because the faculty members have long embraced, in their research and teaching, the integrative and cross-disciplinary approach that is at the heart of the program."
"9488773","GENITOURINARY MALIGNANCIES (GU) RESEARCH PROGRAM PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Genitourinary Malignancies (GU) Research Program explores fundamental biologic pathways of critical importance to the development and progression of prostate, renal and bladder cancer, and fosters translational, investigator-initiated clinical trials to advance therapeutic options for patients with GU malignancies. The overarching goals of the GU Program are to identify core mechanistic pathways that mediate the development and progression of prostate, renal, and bladder cancers and to translate such information to inform and conduct investigator-initiated clinical trials (IITs) that improve patient outcomes. The program is organized around 3 scientific aims: (1) Discover mechanisms of response and resistance to existing and emerging therapies for prostate and renal cancer, (2) Develop novel biomarkers for early detection, prognosis, therapeutic and clinical outcomes across GU malignancies, and (3) Ascertain the immunomodulatory environment of renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer and develop novel immunotherapeutic clinical trials. The aims and the disease-focused nature of the GU Program allow for multi- disciplinary investigations that are highly mechanistic, translational, and clinically focused. These aims reflect major working groups and initiatives that coalesces program members with other cancer center investigators through inter-programmatic collaborations that result in preclinical and clinical research efforts, grants, and trial protocols. Extensive use of Case CCC shared resources, specifically, Biostatistics, Cytometry, Imaging, Athymic, and Translational Research facilitate all aspects of member discoveries. Under the leadership of Brian Rini (Clinical Co-Leader) and Nima Sharifi (Co-Leader) the GU Program has 28 members including 14 full, 3 associate, and 11 clinical members. Members represent 13 departments, giving rise to a total of $4.6M in research grant funding (annual direct costs), of which $3M is peer-reviewed and $1.7M is NCI-funded. Between 2012 and 2016, GU program members published 802 publications.

This highly effective program has made major practice-changing contributions benefiting cancer patients. Examples include: 1) the discovery of an abiraterone metabolite, (D4A), a potent androgen receptor inhibitor, leading to clinical studies; 2) identification of a 17-gene expression that predicts prostate cancer aggressiveness especially for intermediate Gleason score tumors that has been incorporated into NCCN guidelines for treatment decisions; 3) the identification of the role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), PD-L1 and MEK induction in In renal cancers treated with sunitinib leading to Phase III trials; and 4) the discovery of a gain-of-function missense in 3?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (3?HSD1; (HSD3B1)) leading to multiple confirmatory studies indicating worse outcomes in men carrying the polymorphism."
"9483735","We propose to create a massively scalable toolkit to enable large, multi-center Patient-centered Information Commons (PIC) at local, regional and, national scale, where the focus is the alignment of all available biomedical data per individual. Such a Commons is a prerequisite for conducting the large-N, Big Data, longitudinal studies essential for understanding causation in the Precision Medicine framework while simultaneously addressing key complexities of Patient Centric Outcome Research studies required under ACA (Affordable Care Act). This agenda entails the four following aims:    Aim 1: Create an individual patient data identification and retrieval toolkit that is robust across distributed data of wide variety and geographically scattered. Robustness with regard to a variety of organizational structures and national scalability is emphasized.  Aim 2: Generate a complete diagnostic and prognostic 'data' picture of a patient across multiple sources of data, some of which are noisy and sparse.  Aim 3. Enable robust decentralized computation on large-scale data with the Patient-centered Information Commons Big Data Science Platform (PIC-DSP), particularly in configurations where data are generated in locations other than where computational resources are most available.  Aim 4: Create three patient-centered information commons instances (PICIs) to test all aspects of the toolkit developed. We have selected neurodevelopmental disorders as our first PICI, as it fulfills several criteria (wide variety of data types and scales, collaborator engagement, multiple healthcare institutions, and opportunity to rigorously test and refine features of the tool)."
"9598103","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Breast cancer is the most common female cancer and approximately 70-75% of cases express estrogen receptor alpha (ER?). Tamoxifen (TAM) is an estrogen receptor antagonist and the standard endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with ER? positive breast cancer. Unfortunately, resistance to endocrine therapy develops in almost all advanced tumors. Prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP) and its family member prolylendopeptidase (PREP) are members of the prolyl- peptidase family. These enzymes cleave neuropeptide G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists to regulate GPCR signaling. PRCP was identified in a genetic screen for factors that promote TAM resistance in MCF7 cells. Preliminary data show high PRCP expression is correlated with worse prognosis in breast cancer patients. PRCP over-expression increased AKT-mTOR activation, promoted TAM resistance, and induced spontaneous metastasis in MCF7 tumor xenografts. We identified a potent inhibitor of PRCP and PREP termed Y-ox. PRCP/PREP depletion or inhibition by Y-ox destabilized IRS-1 and inhibited AKT-mTOR. Because PRCP and PREP cleave peptide GPCR agonists, we tested if PRCP/PREP regulate IRS-1 and the AKT-mTOR pathway in a GPCR-dependent manner. Our data support a model in which PRCP/PREP increase GPCR-dependent activation of CaMK2 (calcium/calmodulin activated kinase 2), and activated CaMK2 then stabilizes IRS-1 by inhibiting AMPK. Finally, we showed Y-ox destabilized IRS-1 and inhibited feedback activation of AKT in rapamycin treated cells and, in combination with rapamycin increased killing of TAM- resistant cells. Based on these results, we hypothesize 1) PRCP/PREP maintain IRS-1 and the AKT/mTOR pathway in a GPCR and CaMK2-dependent manner, leading to TAM resistance and metastasis, 2) PRCP, PREP, and/or CaMK2 expression in primary breast tumors will correlate with TAM resistance and poor prognosis, 3) combined inhibition of PRCP/PREP and mTOR will reduce feedback activation of the PI3K/AKT and consequently improve treatment of endocrine resistant and metastatic breast tumors."
"9483342","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to estabalish a formalized national resource for lung researchers consisting of a lung disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) bank that can be shared without restriction or exclusivity. More than 200 human lung disease-relevant iPSC clones, and their gene-edited progeny, are now banked in the Center for Regenerative Medicine (CReM) of Boston University/Boston Medical Center, providing an unprecedented opportunity for any basic scientist to derive an inexhaustible supply of patient-derived lung epithelial, vascular, immune, or interstitial cells. These cells containing each patient's own genetic background are now available for in vitro human lung disease modeling, drug screening of personalized therapeutics, and the development of future lung regeneration cell-based therapies. The most valuable human clones in this bank not only carry the most common lung disease-inducing mutations (e.g. mutations in loci encoding CFTR, Alpha-1 antitrypsin, BMPR2, SPC, SPB, ABCA3, and NKX2.1), but also carry knock-in fluorochrome reporters targeted to specific loci through state-of-the-art gene editing technologies. In parallel, the bank also includes 50 mouse iPSC clones generated from transgenic or knock-in mice that carry well characterized fluorochrome reporters of lung lineages (SPC-GFP, T1a-GFP, Tie2-GFP, SMA-GFP, and Nkx2.1-GFP). We propose to establish this cell bank through four specific aims to accomplish the goals of: a) national sharing of iPSCs that comprise a critical resource in high demand by both basic and clinical lung researchers, b) establishment of quality assurance approaches and methods for banking an exhaustive panel of human and mouse lines carrying the most common gene mutations and lung lineage reporter genes required by the majority of U.S. lung researchers in the years ahead, c) development of a formalized education and training program able to nationally disseminate the expertise required to fully harness these new tools and differentiate them into lung lineages, and d) self-sustained maintenance of the bank financially, logistically, and educationally."
"9545055","Project Summary The identification of novel susceptibility genes for complex diseases like COPD could transform our understanding of disease pathophysiology and provide new targets for treatment. The primary goals of this project are to identify the functional genetic variants within five well-established COPD GWAS loci; to identify the key genes influenced by these functional variants; and to assess the impact of these key genes and functional genetic variants on COPD pathogenesis. In recent collaborative GWAS through the International COPD Genetics Consortium, we found 22 genomic loci associated with COPD at genome-wide significance. We will focus our studies in this proposal on five of these COPD GWAS loci that include multiple candidate genes and for which a likely functional variant has not been identified. We hypothesize that an integrated approach that utilizes whole genome sequencing for fine mapping, gene expression data, bioinformatic approaches, and new laboratory assessments will enable the identification of the key genes and functional variants within these five COPD GWAS loci. Moreover, we hypothesize that focused cell-based studies of these key genes and their functional variants will provide novel insights into COPD pathogenesis. To address these hypotheses, we will start by identifying functional variants within these five loci using massively parallel reporter assays in multiple cell types, bioinformatic approaches with public and recently generated Omics data, and genetic association analysis. We will then determine which gene or genes are influenced by these functional variants by performing chromosome conformation capture (4C-Seq), confirming the regulatory effects of the functional variants on the endogenous promoter of the implicated gene, and demonstrating effects on gene expression of the implicated gene by gene editing the regulatory region using CRISP-Cas9 approaches. Finally, we will use cellular models to determine the effects of inactivating the key gene and its functional variants on COPD-related read-outs of cell death, apoptosis, and cell activation. To accomplish these goals, a unique and highly integrated approach combining genetic association analysis, molecular studies of regulatory elements, and functional cell-based assays has been developed that will likely provide important insights into COPD pathogenesis."
"9523172","Project Summary/Abstract Colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, can be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC), also known as virtual colonoscopy, could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, an FDA panel has recently identified two remaining concerns about CTC: patient adherence, and the detection of small polyps and flat lesions. Our clinical multi-center trial showed that laxative-free preparation by oral ingestion of a contrast agent (iodine) to indicate fecal materials for electronic cleansing (EC), followed by computer-aided detection (CADe), makes CTC easy to tolerate for patients while enabling the detection of ?10 mm lesions at sensitivity comparable to that of optical colonoscopy. However, small polyps and flat lesions were a significant source of false negatives, because EC produced image artifacts that imitated such lesions. Because laxative-free CTC addresses the concern of patient adherence, the only remaining concern about CTC is the detection of small polyps and flat lesions. The goal of this project is to develop a novel multi-material deep-learning scheme, hereafter denoted as Deep- ECAD, that integrates EC and CADe for the detection of small polyps and flat lesions in laxative-free spectral CTC (spCTC), where spectral imaging and deep learning will be used to overcome the above limitations of conventional CTC. Our specific aims are to (1) establish a laxative-free ultra-low-dose spCTC image database, (2) develop a multi-material deep-learning method for EC, (3) develop deep radiomic detection of small polyps and flat lesions, and (4) evaluate the clinical benefit of Deep-ECAD with laxative-free cases. Successful development of the proposed Deep-ECAD scheme will substantially improve human readers? performance in the detection of small polyps and flat lesions while minimizing the inconveniences of bowel preparation and radiation risk to patients. Such a scheme will make laxative-free spCTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, in particular, Medicare population, leading to an increased screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer."
"9486906","Title: Selective Strategies for Mycobacterial Cell Wall Labeling 7. Project Summary/Abstract Up to 2 billion people worldwide are infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterial agent of TB. Typical treatments for TB require multiple drugs taken over several months, demonstrating the unique efficacy of Mtb as a pathogen. Studying features essential to the virulence and vitality of Mtb at a molecular level can provide fundamental knowledge about how mycobacteria survive and evolve despite harsh growth conditions and exposure to drug treatment courses. The cell wall of Mtb has been implicated in promoting survival inside lung tissues, and presents a significant barrier to the ability to use diagnostic probes and therapeutic efforts to combat TB. Direct observation of changes in structure and dynamics of the cell wall under conditions relevant to infection (i.e. live macrophage hosts) can provide critical information regarding how this structure responds to drug treatment and the harsh conditions presented by the immune system. This information can be applied towards establishing better methods for diagnosing and treating TB. Bioorthogonal reactions are an attractive technology that enables direct visualization of discrete cellular structures. However, labeling the cell wall of Mtb residing inside host cells is a significant challenge. This proposal seeks to establish imaging strategies using bioorthogonal reactivity for the fluorescent labeling of independent cell wall components of Mtb inside macrophage hosts. Central to this proposal is the ability to use the natural biosynthetic machinery of Mtb to incorporate chemical reporters and fluorophores into the outer glycolipids of the cell envelope. A library of trehalose-conjugated reporters and trehalose-conjugated fluorophores will be designed, synthesized and tested using this metabolic labeling strategy. A similar approach will then be used to fluorescently label peptidoglycan simultaneously with the trehalose glycolipids. Rational molecular design and reaction optimization that enables two simultaneous bioorthogonal reactions to install fluorophores suitable for two- wavelength imaging will be carried out. The invention of a dual labeling strategy will allow for direct imaging of two crucial cell wall components of mycobacteria inside live macrophages. Subsequently, the behavior of these two cell wall components will be investigated as a function of drug treatment and environmental stress using these labeling strategies to directly inform on cell wall structure and metabolism. Through fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence recovery experiments, a model for how multiple cell wall components change over time will be established. Further examination into the defense mechanisms that necessitate multiple drug cocktails to treat TB, as well as how Mtb responds to drug treatments through changes in the cell wall structure, will also be conducted. This research will establish an enabling technology to provide answers to questions regarding the efficacy of Mtb and insight that could lead to improved TB treatment efforts."
"9395059","The primary goal of this application is to foster the development of Dr. Daniel Livorsi as an independent VHA investigator devoted to improving antimicrobial-prescribing across the continuum of healthcare. This application specifically focuses on optimizing the performance of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) in resource-limited settings.  ASPs are hospital-based programs that ensure patients receive the right antimicrobial at the right dose and for the right duration. These programs have proven benefits, such as improving patient safety and reducing antimicrobial resistance. ASPs are now mandated in every VHA facility and will soon be required in non-VHA hospitals as well. The widespread implementation of robust ASPs is essential for addressing the crisis of antimicrobial resistance.  Though necessary, widespread ASP implementation will be challenging. Many ASPs lack access to Infectious Disease (ID) specialists?including 23% of VHA-ASPs?and it is unclear how ASPs can be effective in such resource-limited settings. This application will begin to address this problem through an ambitious but achievable Research Plan.  Project 1 will analyze antimicrobial use data from across the VHA. Multivariable analysis will be used to identify structural and process factors associated with optimal facility-level ASP performance, as measured by facility antimicrobial usage (primary outcome) and 7 secondary metrics. The goal is to identify processes that work for ASPs even in the absence of ID pharmacists and ID physicians. Facilities will also be ranked on the risk-adjusted primary outcome; high and low performers will be identified. Project 2 will use qualitative research methods to determine provider attitudes and organizational factors that impede or foster antimicrobial stewardship at 8 VHA hospitals with ASPs lacking ID support. For this project, the team will conduct research at 4 low-performing and 4 high-performing facilities, as determined by performance on the primary outcome. Project 3 will synthesize the findings from Projects 1 and 2 to develop pilot improvement strategies for low-performing ASPs that lack ID support. The model of Physician Mentored Implementation will guide this intervention, and a pretest-posttest design will be used to assess the effect of the intervention at the 2 intervention hospitals compared to 2 control hospitals.  In addition to the above Research Plan, this application proposes integrated Career Development activities that build on Dr. Livorsi?s expertise in leading ASPs and his prior experience with qualitative assessments and secondary data analysis. These career development activities have the following objectives: 1) gaining fluency in the analysis of national VHA databases and the use of multilevel regression models; 2) building expertise in implementation science with a focus on qualitative assessments; and 3) developing proficiency in the conduct and analysis of multicenter interventions.  These Research and Career Development plans will prepare Dr. Livorsi for submitting an Investigator-Initiated Research proposal focused on refining existing stewardship metrics. In addition, this work will set the stage for future investigations into evaluating and implementing stewardship processes in other healthcare settings, including ambulatory clinics, emergency rooms, and Community Living Centers."

The Cytometry SR provides high quality and essential cell imaging services to multiple investigators across the Case CCC. Use of distant SRs would be inefficient and uncertain, and principle investigators could not complete the aims of NIH grants without access to cytometry and microscopy."
"9452917","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The steadily high mortality associated with melanoma is in part due to the limitations of predicting the melanoma recurrence, especially for patients with early-stage disease. While currently available clinicopathological characteristics provide some information, their ability to predict outcome in a more personalized fashion is limited. Recent studies have proposed a number of molecular predictors in pathways related to melanoma progression, but these are too general to cater the prognostic assessment to individual patients and will still require independent validation. The central hypothesis of our study is that the melanoma recurrence is modulated but common or rare germline genetic factors. We postulate that such loci will be associated with the risk of early recurrence in clinically favorable melanomas, and potentially with protective effect in less favorable advanced stages manifesting with late to no relapse. In support of the proposed hypothesis we have generated highly promising preliminary data demonstrating that the germline genetic factors may impact melanoma clinical outcomes. Building on these observations we propose a comprehensive genetic profiling of germline and tumor specimens of melanoma patients ascertained at NYUMC to identify novel germline genetic loci associated with the risk of melanoma recurrence. In Specific Aim 1 we will perform germline whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and tumor whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) on Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) early stage melanoma patients (stage I/II) on extremes of melanoma recurrence: comparing patients with early recurrence (n=100) versus late or no recurrence (n=100). The germline and tumor data will be integrated in our newly developed strategy to identify biologically most plausible candidates associated with risk of recurrence. The selection of AJ ancestry will significantly improve the design by reducing the genetic heterogeneity and enhancing the analytical power by identification of founder alleles associated with recurrence, that are shared among AJ patients. In Specific Aim 2 we will test the identified genetic loci in Aim 1 for their association with recurrence outcomes and other clinical indicators in a melanoma cohort of 1,354 patients of predominantly non-AJ European ancestries. In Specific Aim 3, the novel germline loci associated with melanoma recurrence will be functionally tested in zebrafish melanoma model, identifying targetable variants with biological role in melanoma progression and outcome. The novel germline variants/mutations will be, in parallel, incorporated into prognostic melanoma model using an additional population of 1,268 melanoma patients from NYULMC subsets. The findings generated in this study will not only reveal novel markers of melanoma prognosis with more personalized clinical potential, but the comprehensive exploration of their biological role, as proposed, may point to novel molecular pathways in melanoma progression. Hence, besides improved clinical follow-up care of patients at early stage of melanoma, the study's impact is in the discovery of putatively novel targets of more personalized adjuvant therapies tailored for the melanoma patients with early disease but high risk of recurrence."
"9672210","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will test the long-term impact of the Family Check-Up (FCU) approach to preventing substance use and other high-risk problem behaviors from toddlerhood through adolescence by enhancing parenting. A critical question for a randomized prevention trial such as this is the extent to which early family support reduces adolescent alcohol and drug use (ADU), high-risk sexual behavior linked to HIV-AIDS, and serious problem behaviors in adolescence. The study also will examine how reduction in these adolescent problem behaviors is mediated by improvement in parenting and peer environments and is moderated by the family ecology and genetic risk. The proposed study will include follow-up assessments of 731 children through adolescence that include the collection of DNA; observations of family interaction; parent, youth and teacher report of adjustment; and assessments of and reports about peer environments. The Early Steps (ES) multisite sample was recruited from WIC centers in three geographically, socioeconomically, and ethnically diverse communities: Pittsburgh, PA; Charlottesville, VA; and Eugene, OR. To increase the number of sample families at risk for later ADU, eligibility was restricted to WIC families with additional socioeconomic (i.e., low parental education), family (i.e., maternal stress), and child (i.e., toddler conduct problems) risk factors. The children and families were initially assessed at child age 2 and then yearly through age 10.5, using a multi-agent and multi-method strategy that included direct observations of family interaction in most years. Families were randomly assigned to be offered a yearly FCU intervention, including adapted and tailored family management interventions. Specifically, the Family Check-Up will be evaluated as it relates to reducing adolescent substance use, high-risk sexual behavior linked to HIV, and other serious problem behavior at ages 14 and 16, how such intervention effects might be mediated by changes in parenting, and moderated by neighborhood adversity and GxE interactions."
"9570696","ABSTRACT: OVERALL COMPONENT We propose an innovative and synergistic combination of research, career development, and community partnership activities that will engage communities in delivering and disseminating health disparity interventions.

The Administrative Core will oversee, manage, and coordinate all proposed activities and will facilitate equitable, collaborative, and sustainable relationships with communities, institutions, and other stakeholders. The Investigator Development Core will publicize the availability of a pilot project program and utilize an online system for submission and review of applications. Both academic investigators and community organizations will provide intensive support to pilot awardees to ensure successful project completion. Our two complementary research projects involve novel approaches for engaging community members. The first project seeks to address social contextual factors that function as barriers to hypertension management. We will train lay health advisors to help African American patients with poorly controlled hypertension to address these barriers. The second project seeks to increase the input of health disparity populations into the dissemination of research findings by medical journals. We will train and mentor community members to review manuscripts for two prominent journals. Journal editorial teams will then use these reviews in decisions to accept, revise, or reject manuscripts. The Community Engagement and Dissemination Core will engage with and disseminate research findings to community members, partner organizations, service organizations, policymakers, and scientists. The Community Core will also develop a strategic plan to translate research findings into sustainable community and system-level changes that will have a measurable impact on minority health and health disparities. An independent evaluator will monitor and evaluate the processes and outcomes of our activities. We will use ongoing evaluations to modify and improve our activities. Strengths and innovative features of our application include involvement of a broad range of community organizations, institutions, and multidisciplinary faculty and staff; use of theoretical models or conceptual frameworks to guide the work of each Core and project; synergistic use of overlapping personnel, community partners, and shared activities across Cores and projects; strong institutional commitment by Case Western Reserve University and MetroHealth Medical Center, including provision of additional resources; and the experience, expertise, and prior productivity of the personnel involved in the Center of Excellence."
"9573792","Staphylococcus aureus is often the cause of nosocomial infections, particularly when these infections involve bacterial colonization of indwelling devices. The fact that these bacteria are frequently carried asymptomatically on the skin and mucosal surfaces of many individuals permits easy colonization of the pristine surfaces of such devices during implantation. Once biofilms grow on these surfaces, they are difficult to eradicate because the constituent cells become largely insensitive to the action of many commonly used antibiotics. These findings, combined with the fact that a large percentage of S. aureus isolates identified in infections are now resistant to numerous antibiotics makes it clear that new ways of combating staphylococcal biofilm-associated infections need to be developed. The goal of this project is to understand how methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) forms biofilms and thereby identify targets for the discovery of drugs that block or reverse the formation of surface-associated communities.  To form a biofilm, S. aureus must produce an extracellular matrix. Major components of the matrix are proteins and DNA. Many of the proteins are cytoplasmic in origin and are thus moonlighting in their second role as components of the matrix. The extracellular DNA requires the matrix proteins in order to adhere to the cells, serving as an electrostatic net that holds the remaining cells together in the biofilm. Using a comprehensive molecular genetic approach, we identified genes needed for the release of extracellular DNA during biofilm formation, including the gene for a phosphodiesterase that controls the levels of a well-known second messenger, cyclic-di-AMP. We have shown that cyclic-di-AMP levels drop when cells enter the biofilm state.  We propose to take advantage of a biosensor for measuring cyclic-di-AMP levels in cells to identify genes that control its levels as cells enter the biofilm state. We will take advantage of the discovery that mutants with altered levels of the second messenger are resistant to the dye Congo red to discover additional genes involved in controlling cyclic-di-AMP levels.  We propose that the drop in cyclic-di-AMP levels weakens the cell envelope, causing some cells to lyse and liberate protein and DNA for incorporation into the matrix. We will investigate the hypothesis that low cyclic-di-AMP levels impair proper biosynthesis of teichoic acid, the cell envelope polymers needed for cell wall integrity.  Finally, we exploit our fluorescent assay for c-di-AMP to carry out a cell-based screen for small molecules that cause levels of the second messenger to rise. These hits will be a starting point for the development of drugs that block biofilm formation."

Our three year training program will include having selected individuals participate in an intensive, one-month focused research ethics training program at JHU, on-site technical consultations from a JHU IRB expert and two African bioethics experts (both Fogarty alumni), ethics seminars led by local ethics experts, monthly support telephone calls with JHU and African IRB consultants, and a webinar series on meeting practical challenges of REC operations. These activities will provide rigorous, on-going strategies to strengthen the quality o ethics review by UNZABREC and its administrative efficiency, building both on JHU's expertise in research ethics and ethics review and leveraging the expertise of two African colleagues well versed in high quality IRB operations. We will measure UNZABREC members' ethics knowledge before and after the program using an original tool, and we will measure various administrative efficiency measures such as time to review completion. We also will implement an original needs assessment tool that more broadly measures committee strengths and needs/gaps to then training to what is needed. We expect UNZABREC ultimately to be a model and resource for other RECs in Africa and for researchers facing ethics challenges in their HIV and other studies."
"9482695","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are multiprotein channels that penetrate the nuclear envelope and connect the nucleus with the cytoplasm. Besides controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport, NPCs are involved in chromatin organization and gene expression regulation. Changes in the composition of these structures have been recently linked to myoblast differentiation, suggesting a role for specialized NPCs in muscle physiology. In adults, muscle regeneration and repair requires the efficient function of satellite cells. Upon injury, these muscle stem cells are induced to proliferate, differentiate into myoblasts and fuse to regenerate muscle fibers. Because satellite cells are essential for muscle repair and regeneration, transplantation of these cells represents a promising therapy for the treatment of damaged muscle, muscular dystrophies and sarcopenia. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of satellite cell function has become of great interest for regenerative medicine. Previous studies have found that the expression of the nuclear pore complex protein Nup210 is required for myoblast differentiation and survival, indicating an essential role for this protein i skeletal muscle differentiation and regeneration. Additionally, up-regulation of Nup210 levels in myoblasts has been shown to accelerate myogenesis, suggesting that modulation of its activity could be exploited to stimulate muscle regeneration. The overall objectives of this proposal are to establish the molecular mechanisms through which the nucleoporin Nup210 regulates myogenesis and to define its function in muscle formation and maintenance, with the ultimate goal of defining its potential as a therapeutic target for muscle regeneration. By combining in vivo and in vitro genetic approaches with muscle injury studies we expect to establish the role of Nup210 in muscle formation, growth and repair (Aim 1) and define the molecular mechanisms of myogenic regulation by Nup210 (Aim 2). In addition, we will determine if modulating the activity of this nuclear pore complex component can stimulate muscle regeneration and reverse the myogenic defects of dystrophic myoblasts. Defining the function of Nup210 in muscle physiology and understanding its molecular mechanisms of action are critical steps to determine whether this pathway could be used to develop therapies directed to stimulate muscle healing and prevent muscle degeneration. Our contribution here is expected to be a detailed understanding of the role of Nup210 in myogenesis, muscle development and muscle regeneration. These studies will significantly advance our knowledge of how changes in nuclear pore complex composition and function regulate these processes and could uncover new targets on which therapies to improve muscle function or prevent muscle degeneration can be developed."

"9573447","PROJECT SUMMARY Role of BRCA1 in normal and neoplastic bone marrow cells We have recently discovered that Brca1 is necessary for normal hematopoiesis, but mutation of this gene in hematopoietic cells rarely predispose carriers to leukemia. We have collected a number of convergent data sets that serve as the foundation for the studies proposed here. First, we have found that humans heterozygous for BRCA1 mutations may have an increased risk for chemotherapy-associated febrile neutropenia. Second, mice deficient for Brca1 in the hematopoietic system experience bone marrow failure associated with severe hematopoietic stem cell and progenitor defects, and third, mice heterozygous for Brca1 deficiency have slight defects in bone marrow reconstitution due to problematic functional hematopoietic stem cell activity. From these data, we have developed two hypotheses that we propose to test: BRCA1 is required for normal hematopoiesis and BRCA1 plays a role in emergency granulopoiesis, which is the acute response of hematopoietic progenitors to infection or other stressors. We propose that BRCA1 is regulated by interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) expression, which is induced by infections or other stresses that lead to emergency granulopoiesis. Interestingly, an absolute requirement of BRCA1 for hematopoiesis may explain why people with BRCA1 mutations do not have an increased risk for leukemia: their bone marrow stem and progenitor cells die without BRCA1 before these cells have a chance to transform. Here, we will first identify the cellular and molecular events required for Brca1 to maintain normal hematopoiesis and examine the phenotypes of different human BRCA1 mutations using a humanized Brca1 mouse model. We will also conduct a study with additional patients from our cancer genetics clinic to examine the relationship between BRCA1 mutations and hematopoietic toxicity. Finally, we will examine the increases in BRCA1 levels during stress granulopoiesis and BRCA1 function in this pathway. This area of investigation is unexplored, and our results will facilitate a better understanding of the requirements for Brca1 in normal and neoplastic hematopoiesis and the chemotherapy toxicities in patients, ultimately leading to improved treatment of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome patients as well as insight into the tissue specificity of BRCA1 mutation-associated tumorigenesis."
"9488765","PROTEOMICS SHARED RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Proteomics Shared Resource (Proteomics SR) is an essential asset to Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC) members' research, illustrated by the breadth of scientific program involvement and reflected in the large number of investigators who use this SR. Last year alone, over 120 investigators, 35% of whom were Case CCC members, accounting for 44% of total usage, from all 7 of the Case CCC Programs used the SR. The mission of the Proteomics SR is to provide advanced proteomic and metabolomic technologies and small- molecule analysis, especially for pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, via state-of-the-art instruments, computational resources, and trained staff, to support clinical, translational, and structural biology research. The Specific Aims of the Proteomics SR are to:  1) Provide advanced proteomic and metabolomics technologies and instrument resources to solve unmet  needs in cancer research.  2) Develop and apply systems biology tools to solve challenges in analysis and integration of large ?omics? datasets.  3) Provide professional education, consultation and training to Case CCC members. At last review, the Proteomics SR was rated Exceptional merit. Throughout the current funding cycle (2012- 2016), the Proteomics SR provided services to 268 registered users, 83 (31%) of whom are Case CCC members, representing all 7 of the Case CCC programs. The Proteomics SR continues to attract new users, and to provide multiple sophisticated proteomic techniques and technique-specific training to investigators' cancer-related projects. The SR has also developed new technologies and bioinformatics tools that directly facilitate Case CCC members' research, including a global metabolomic and lipidomic platform that will complement both targeted metabolomics and global proteomic experiments. The Proteomics SR consists of two sites; the first site was established at the Cleveland Clinic (CC) Lerner Research Institute (LRI) in 1999 and the second site, the Center for Proteomics & Bioinformatics (CPB) at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in 2005. This multi-site Shared Resource, jointly supported and managed by the Case CCC, the CWRU School of Medicine (SOM) and CC, provides access to a full spectrum of proteomic and metabolomic technologies. The services of the Proteomics SR are essential for enhancing the quality of the science in the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center."
"9522398","Significant increases in global health investment to deliver low-cost, efficacious interventions contributed to an over 50% reduction in under-five mortality in the 25 years leading up to the end of the Millennium Development Goals in 2015. The rate of decline in child mortality has slowed due to high neonatal mortality (mortality in the first 28 days of life), especially in low resource settings in sub-Saharan Africa. In countries with high neonatal mortality, improving the quality and coverage of implementation of Ministry of Health guidelines that include available, evidence-based interventions delivered at or around the time of birth has the potential to jump start stalled population-level child mortality reductions. Audit and feedback approaches systematically assess and provide feedback to health professionals on their performance to guide adjustments to practice, and have the potential to improve the routine implementation of evidence-based guidelines for clinical interventions that prevent neonatal deaths. The Integrated District Evidence to Action (IDEAs) program is a multifaceted, enhanced audit and feedback implementation intervention that aims to improve the coverage and quality of a package of existing, evidence-based clinical interventions targeting major causes of neonatal mortality. IDEAs modifies audit and feedback by engaging health managers across the tiers of facility, district and province (rather than front line health workers in isolation). Furthermore, it is enhanced with systematically collected health service readiness data and routine district to facility supportive supervision to provide ongoing support to facility personnel who deliver clinical interventions that prevent neonatal deaths The overall goal of this application is to gather evidence on spreading the IDEAs audit and feedback intervention that is led by district management teams (rather than research teams), to serve as a foundation for national scale-up. We propose to implement IDEAs in 12 high population districts in central Mozambique using district management teams as disseminating agents, who will implement IDEAs in subordinate health facilities. Using a 4.5-year quasi-experimental design, a mixed- methods evaluation will be used to assess the impact of the intervention on health system responsiveness, as well as quality and coverage of interventions to prevent neonatal deaths. Our specific aims are to: Aim 1: Evaluate a funded district-based dissemination and implementation strategy for the IDEAs intervention, using the RE-AIM model to assess the program?s Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance; and Aim 2: Via activity based micro-costing and health outcomes modeling, estimate the potential budget and program impact from the payer perspective to scale-up IDEAs compared to the standard of care. The results of this implementation research are expected to generate knowledge of global significance, and by providing a real- world implementation model for the IDEAs intervention and programmatically relevant information, is designed to lead to rapid policy translation for future scale-up in Mozambique, and more broadly in countries with high neonatal mortality and weak delivery systems."
"9671649","The Developmental Neurology Training Program at Boston Children's Hospital is designed to produce trainees who are equipped for and deeply engaged in state-of-the-art research in developmental neuroscience from a detailed and mechanistic perspective, while also cognizant of the clinical importance of their field and the clinical challenges and opportunities today. We take advantage of the presence of an extraordinary community of basic neuroscientists at Children's Hospital and its affiliated institutions, embedded in a world-class clinical setting. We select outstanding candidates who will work in one of 30 mentor laboratories and engage in fundamental research into the mechanisms that guide the development of the nervous system. These highly interactive laboratories employ genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, electrophysiology, anatomy and behavior and use systems ranging from Drosophila to mouse, rat, and human cells. Consequently, our trainees are exposed to the full breadth of the field and are prepared to make informed strategic decisions. It is a special feature of this training program that each trainee will be paired with a clinician or clinician-scientist as a co-mentor with the goal of helping trainees to understand the relationship of basic research to health and disease. This co-mentoring relationship will take advantage of the hospital setting and augment the rich opportunities for learning about translational research. The goal of the program is not to distract from an intensive research experience in fundamental molecular mechanisms of neurodevelopment, but rather to inform the trainee of its context in human health. The research experience of the trainee is also enhanced by an unusually extensive mentoring relationship with the Director of the Training Program, Prof. Thomas Schwarz, who meets with and advises all the trainees to offer feedback and career guidance. The training experience is also supplemented by a wealth of career-guidance instruction, including presentations skills, job- seeking skills, information about diverse career options, and of course the responsible conduct of research. All of this is situated within an environment of extraordinary resources and intellectual life. We have recruited a racially and ethnically diverse faculty of mentors and are committed to enhancing the diversity of the community of neuroscientists through our Training Program. The program thus seeks to enhance the experience of trainees beyond the opportunity to work with superb scientists tackling essential questions. There are few challenges in neuroscience as great as understanding the processes that result in neurodevelopmental disorders and intellectual disabilities and there is a growing awareness that many affective disorders arise from errors in development. Without deeper mechanistic understanding of these processes, the clinical challenges will remain. Training the next generation for this task is imperative."
"9475171","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT - CLINICAL CORE The Mayo ADRC Clinical Core recruits, evaluates and follows longitudinally persons with cognitive disorders as well as cognitively normal persons who serve as controls. The Clinical Core is led by 4 behavioral neurologists (one in Jacksonville and 3 in Rochester) who have considerable expertise in the cognitive syndromes of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-Alzheimer degenerative spectrum, as well as the cerebrovascular spectrum. In the past 4 years, the Mayo ADRC has made significant contributions in the areas of genetics and imaging of AD, the genetics, imaging and clinical characterization of the syndromes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and the clinical and imaging characterization of Dementia with Lewy Bodies. We have participated in numerous national consortia for clinical trials (industry and ADCS), genetics (ADGC) and imaging (ADNI). We have had excellent success with recruiting and retaining our research participants. In the past 4 years, we have recruited African American participants into a variety of projects and trials. Moreover, in conjunction with our Outreach, Recruitment and Education Core, we have a great increase in the number of African American participants who have agreed to brain donation after death. Although we do not require autopsy consent from our participants, our overall autopsy rate was 54%. For the new grant cycle, we intend to continue our activities in these focus areas. Thus, our specific aims include recruiting and following persons in the AD degenerative spectrum, persons with Dementia with Lewy Bodies and persons with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) spectrum from preclinical to dementia. We will also recruit cognitively normal volunteers who agree to undergo brain imaging and cognitively normal persons with sleep disorders such as REM Sleep Behavior Disorder that are known to be predictive of synucleinopathy. This latter group will be recruited in order to address an understudied area, namely the preclinical manifestations of Lewy Body Disease. Our interest in this unique group of individuals takes advantage of our longstanding involvement in both mild cognitive impairment and in the Lewy Body Disease spectrum. We will also devote the necessary resources and effort for enhancing our recruiting and following of African American normal volunteers and patients with disorders in the AD, DLB and FTLD spectra. In support of another of our aims, we will obtain DNA on cognitively normal, MCI and dementia participants (AD, LBD, FTLD) in order to supply ADRC-related genetics projects with genetic material. All of the persons who are recruited and followed by the Mayo ADRC will have an evaluation by a behavioral neurologist, a neuropsychological assessment battery that includes the UDS as well as additional procedures, and multimodal brain imaging for the majority of participants. The Clinical Core will continue to work closely with the Neuropathology Core and ADRC related projects that require clinical- pathological correlation."
"9474214","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obsessive-compulsive behaviors (OCB) are common in children and adolescents. In addition to being the core features of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), OCB are often associated in youth with tic, grooming, generalized anxiety, and autistic spectrum disorders. This competitive renewal application combines the unique clinical assessment, magnetic resonance imaging, and genetics expertise of three performance sites: Wayne State University (WSU), University of Michigan (UM), and the Hospital for Sick Children, affiliated with the University of Toronto (UT). The overall goal of this project - which extends prior and existing NIMH-funded research including Drs. Rosenberg and Diwadkar's neurodiagnostic imaging-genetic studies (K24MH02037; R01MH59299), Dr. Hanna's family, molecular genetic, and action monitoring studies (R01MH53876; R01MH59299; K20MH01065; R01MH101493) and Dr. Arnold and colleagues' extensive genetic studies in pediatric OCD (R01MH59299; R01MH101493) - is to exploit the emerging field of imaging genetics to 1) determine the relationship between alterations in functional connectivity of fronto-striatal-thalamic circuitry (FSTC) as measured by task and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and childhood OCB; 2) identify common, rare, and novel genetic variants associated with alterations in connectivity of FSTC as measured by fMRI; 3) clarify whether fMRI measured alterations in FSTC are potential intermediate phenotypes of OCB by determining whether they mediate the effects of genetic variants on OCB; and 4) combine structural MRI data from this study and our previous imaging genetics study to identify genetic variants associated with anterior cingulate volume and other FSTC structures in 1000 youth. The Child Behavior Checklist Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CBCL-OCS) shows substantial heritability in pediatric twin studies. Heritability of structural and functional abnormalities in STC has also been demonstrated in OCD patients and their unaffected relatives. By using a research design consistent with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), targeted high field (3 Tesla) fMRI at WSU will be combined with comprehensive genomic assessment in 200 child psychiatric outpatients with CBCL-OCS scores = 5, 200 child psychiatric outpatients with CBL-OCS scores < 5, and 200 matched healthy controls aged 8-18 years. We will examine for common and rare genomic variants associated with FSTC dysregulation and conduct whole genome sequencing (WGS) in 60 subjects with FSTC dysregulation in the highest 10% of the distribution and compare to 60 subjects with FSTC dysregulation in the lowest 10% of the distribution to identify rare and novel variants of possible clinical significance. This unique study enacts the call for translational approaches to mental illness outlined in PAR- 14-165 by examining multiple genomic variants in FSTC in a spectrum of common, but understudied disorders in youth. Our work will provide a better understanding of the impact of genetic variants on FSTC dysregulation in the pathogenesis of OCB and lead to new diagnostic, treatment, and prevention strategies."
"9416710","PROJECT SUMMARY Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) form contiguous, semi-permeable barriers between the bloodstream and the interstitial space. cAMP generated by plasma membrane-localized adenylyl cyclases (ACs) enhances PMVEC barriers. In contrast, cytosolic cAMP, cGMP, and cUMP generated by exogenous and endogenous soluble cyclases disrupt PMVEC barriers. These observations suggest that cyclic nucleotide signals are highly localized, or compartmentalized, and that near-membrane and cytosolic cAMP, cGMP, and perhaps cUMP signals have opposing effects on endothelial function in the lung microvasculature. The concept of compartmentalized signals implies that feedback networks localized to specific subcellular domains control the kinetics of second messenger signals. However, our understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological implications of localized feedback networks within pulmonary endothelial cells is at best rudimentary. Thus, the overall goal of this project is to determine the spatial and temporal relationships between compartmentalized cAMP signals, PKA-mediated feedback networks, and regulation of mechanical forces in pulmonary endothelial cells. Experiments described in this proposal will for the first time identify where cAMP signals occur in the 3D space of PMVECs, identify important temporal components of cAMP signals, and chart feedback mechanisms contributing to signal localization and kinetics of these signals. In other words, we will provide roadmaps identifying the spatial locations of cAMP signals that are critical for controlling the dynamics of cellular forces. We will then overlay these responses onto PKA activity maps and underlying distributions of A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). As such, successful completion of the studies proposed in this application will identify the spatial and temporal fingerprints of specific cAMP signalosomes that regulate mechanical forces within pulmonary endothelial cells, and thus control endothelial barrier integrity. The spatial and temporal fingerprints will direct future studies aimed at identifying target proteins within these signalosomes, leading to both a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying localized signal transduction and identifying translational targets within signalosomes."

"9482432","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung inflammation and alterations in endothelial permeability play a major role in the pathophysiology of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the conditions associated with high mortality rates. Low efficiency of current therapies may be explained in part by focus on drug treatments aimed at prevention of the onset of ALI, while endogenous feedback mechanisms which subside inflammatory activation and endothelial barrier dysfunction, although much more clinically relevant, remain poorly understood.  Our studies in the previous cycle identified a novel role of microtubule peripheral network in the control of lung endothelial barrier function. We discovered that stimulation of microtubule peripheral growth by barrier enhancing agonists, such as hepatocyte growth factor, promoted Rac GTPase-dependent and attenuated Rho GTPase-dependent signaling, thus leading to downregulation of vascular leak. We defined a novel paradigm of dual regulation of Rac and Rho pathways by microtubule-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factors Asef and GEF-H1 and demonstrated essential role of the microtubules in the mechanisms of Rac-Rho crosstalk and control of endothelial permeability. However, the entire mechanism of microtubule-dependent regulation of onset and resolution of ALI, and specifically, microtubule-dependent modulation of inflammatory cascades, remains poorly understood.  During the screening of potential signaling proteins associated with the microtubules in control and inflamed pulmonary endothelium, we discovered an association of a negative regulator of inflammatory signaling, SOCS1, with the microtubule fraction. This serendipity finding suggested a novel link between the microtubule cytoskeleton and control of endothelial inflammation and inflammation-induced permeability. Currently, a role of microtubules in the modulation of endothelial barrier response to bacterial wall compounds, cytokines, etc., remains virtually unknown. We hypothesize that cellular feedback mechanisms modulating cell inflammatory response critically require microtubule-assisted SOCS1 targeting to the submembrane compartment, where it interacts with its cytokine receptor- and TLR-associated protein targets. Using cell, ex vivo, and in vivo models of LPS-induced ALI this application will characterize regulation of LPS-induced inflammation by SOCS1, investigate involvement of microtubules in control of SOCS1 anti-inflammatory function, and will identify molecular mechanisms of active microtubule-assisted SOCS1 transport and submembrane targeting. The results of this project will delineate novel microtubule-dependent mechanisms regulating lung barrier dysfunction and inflammation, which may lead to discovery of a new group of pharmacological molecules for the treatment of ALI/ARDS."
"9478552","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed project is to define the contribution of joint hypermobility to lower body osteoarthritis (OA). Results of this study wil inform clinical practice and determine groups at high risk for OA who require targeted prevention or intervention approaches. The rationale for the proposed research is that: 1) joint hypermobility changes joint mechanics, 2) joint hypermobility is an expected independent risk factor for OA, and 3) joint hypermobility increases the risk of injury, a major risk factor for OA. The central hypothesis is that joint hypermobility is associated with lower body OA (lumbar spine, hips, knees, ankles, and feet) and that joint hypermobility magnifies the effects of other OA risk factors (i.e., joint injury). In Aim 1, we will assess the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships of joint hypermobility with prevalent, incident, and progressive lumbar spine, hip, and knee OA. We will examine these relationships by age, sex, and body mass index because joint hypermobility declines with age, is more common in women than men, and varies with obesity. In Aim 2, we will evaluate whether joint hypermobility interacts with joint injury with regard to prevalent, incident, and progressive lumbar spine, hip, and knee OA. In Aim 3, we will explore the cross- sectional relationship of joint hypermobility and prevalent OA at the foot and ankle, joints that have not been examined in prior studies of joint hypermobility and OA. To achieve these aims, we will conduct the largest study to date of over 6900 participants from three large studies of participants with and without OA. OA, injury, and joint hypermobility data were consistently and identically measured across all 3 studies. The multidisciplinary team includes collaborative and productive researchers and clinicians with expertise in OA and injury epidemiology, rheumatology, musculoskeletal radiology, biomechanics, and biostatistics. The Principal Investigator is an Early Stage Investigator, an OA and injury epidemiologist, and an experienced physical therapist. She is in her final year as a NIH/NCATS (National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences) KL2 Scholar in which she is developing independent research on non-pharmacologic / non- surgical interventions for biomechanical risk factors of OA."
"9481674","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lubricin/proteoglycan 4 (encoded by the gene PRG4), a mucinous glycoprotein expressed by superficial zone chondrocytes and type B synoviocytes, is critically important in the protection and maintenance of diarthrodial joints. Lubricin provides boundary lubrication to cartilage surfaces, prevents friction-induced wear, chondrocyte apoptosis, and cartilage loss. An individual diagnosed with cruciate ligament or meniscal tears or joint inflammation can develop transient lubricin deficiency that causes irreversible loss of chondrocytes, culminating in cartilage failure years later. Pre-clinical studis by our laboratories and others show that the intraarticular injection of recombinant human PRG4 (rhPRG4) in the ACL transected or partially meniscectomized rat joint, shortly after surgery, results in more articular cartilage and signs of less degeneration than placebo-injected animals. These animals also show evidence of re-establishment of native PRG4 expression. The over expression of PRG4 in a mouse trauma model also indicated that lubricin can re- establish chondroprotection after injury. We have recently reported that rhPRG4 binds to the CD44 receptor on synoviocytes from patients with RA and blocks pro-inflammatory cytokines induced proliferation of RA synoviocytes. This effect was shown to be mediated by inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF?B). We propose to study the anti-inflammatory effect of PRG4 in a model of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1ß) stimulated synoviocytes from patients with OA. We will investigate the modulatory effect of PRG4 on cytokine secretion by OA synoviocytes and the mechanism by which it exerts its biological effect (Aim 1). In aim 2, we examine the biological activity of synovial fluid resident PRG4 and characterize PRG4's role across patients with different OA severities and in patients with a recent history of cruciate ligament trauma. We will also characterize the CD44-dependent effect of PRG4 in synovial fluids. In aim 3, we will study the interaction of PRG4 and CD44 in a mouse model where PRG4 expression can be manipulated in the absence or presence of CD44. We hypothesize that the synovial hyperplasia that is observed in a PRG4 gene trap mouse that is lubricin null is dependent on CD44. Understanding these distinct modes of action will be important to many who develop transient deficiencies of lubricin following an acute joint injury or inflammatory joint disease. This is particularly true snce rhPRG4 is being developed as a device-like biologic."
"9663365","PROJECT SUMMARY  Recent advances in cell reprogramming have raised considerable interest in the use of stem cells for regenerative therapies to replace damaged or lost cells. Stem cells integrate a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic cues to maintain their fate and proliferative capacity. Importantly, these cues include steroid hormones, which fluctuate during childhood growth and development, pregnancy, and disease, and nuclear hormone receptors, which receive steroid signals to regulate physiological homeostasis. A basic understanding of how stem cells respond to changes in human physiology is therefore a necessary prerequisite to the increased use of stem cells in clinical therapy. Like other nuclear hormone receptor signaling pathways, the insect steroid hormone ecdysone is known to elicit context-dependent cellular responses; however, it is largely unknown how these responses are achieved. The nuclear hormone receptor Ftz-f1 is an ecdysone target, but it is also required for the maximal transcriptional response of other ecdysone targets (namely, E74 and E75) in embryonic and larval tissues. This suggests that Ftz-f1 activity primes some cells to respond to ecdysone by up- regulating a specific transcriptional pathway. Despite the identification of mutant alleles nearly 25 years ago, no studies to date have addressed the function of Ftz-f1 in the ovary. Our studies will test the central hypothesis that Ftz-f1 acts as a competence factor for ecdysone signaling in the ovary. Germline stem cells (GSCs) in the Drosophila melanogaster ovary are well-suited for these studies, due to their easily accessible anatomical location, sensitivity to steroid hormones, and the availability of genetic and experimental techniques. Our studies will not only reveal important new information about the function of ftz-f1 in stem cells and reproduction, but can also serve as a novel paradigm for the study of context-dependent steroid hormone signaling in vivo. In my new independent lab, we will utilize Drosophila genetic mutants and in vivo cell-specific gene knockdown to investigate whether and how ftz-f1 regulates GSCs and their progeny, and test whether ftz-f1 primes specific cells for ecdysone signaling. In Aim 1, we will examine the role of ftz-f1 in the differentiation of GSCs and their progeny. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether ftz-f1 controls the cell cycle in GSCs and their progeny. In Aim 3, we will use genetic interaction experiments to determine whether ftz-f1 functionally interacts with ecdysone signaling. Given the similarity between Drosophila and human steroid hormone signaling, our study will help elucidate how nuclear hormone receptors differentially regulate context-dependent transcriptional pathways in vivo to control stem cell function."
"9395132","BACKGROUND Fragmented health care ? the splitting of a patient's care across multiple providers ? increases risks of patient and provider dissatisfaction, resource waste, and potentially devastating health outcomes. Coordinating care to prevent these outcomes is a VA priority, and an increasing challenge as Veterans receive more care from non- VA providers. Coordination is the organization of patient care between two or more participants to ensure appropriate delivery of healthcare services. For specialty care referrals, which number >25 million yearly in VA, the most direct participants are patient, specialist and PCP, the ?specialty care triad?. To improve specialty care coordination, a measure and interventions are needed that account for the experience of each triad member. OBJECTIVES  Aim 1. 1.1. Adapt a trio of surveys designed to a) measure the experience of specialty care coordination,  and b) measure the frequency and effectiveness of specific coordination mechanisms among  patients, medical specialists, and primary care providers  1.2. Determine the psychometric properties of the survey questions on coordination (from 1.1a)  Aim 2. 2.1. Use qualitative methods to identify barriers and facilitators to effective use of 4 specialty care  coordination mechanisms that are found in Aim 1 to be both widely used and variably successful  Aim 3. 3.1. Use data from Aim 2 to develop and pilot-test an intervention to implement one or more  mechanisms to improve specialty care coordination, and evaluate it on the basis of feasibility,  acceptability, and changes in scores of survey questions about mechanisms (from 1.1b)  3.2. Examine concurrent validity of the survey questions about coordination (from 1.1a) by  comparing changes in them pre- and post-intervention to changes in existing validated scales METHODS In Aim 1, existing instruments will be adapted into 3 surveys to measure the experience of specialty care coordination and the helpfulness of specific mechanisms to coordinate. Psychometric properties of the surveys will be assessed through a national VA pilot administration. In Aim 2, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with triad members at 8 VA medical centers, to understand the key factors to success of 4 selected mechanisms. Data analysis will use a mixed deductive-inductive approach and be guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Aim 3 will build on Aims 1 and 2 to develop and evaluate a multi- faceted intervention that uses one or more mechanisms to improve specialty care coordination for the triad. ANTICIPATED IMPACT This CDA will provide a metric of success that accounts for the experience of the most direct participants in specialty care coordination, including the patient. It will provide information about the barriers and facilitators to success of commonly used mechanisms to coordinate specialty care. It will also result in an intervention to improve specialty care coordination for the triad members. In future work, the survey measure 1) can be used to evaluate and compare interventions to improve coordination, both within and outside of VA; 2) can be used to identify which organizational features and mechanisms to coordinate care correlate with high and low success in specialty care coordination, for each triad member; and 3) will allow examination of which aspects of coordination, from which triad members' perspectives, are associated with which clinical and cost outcomes.  "
"9625348","ABSTRACT While we know that African Americans are disproportionately arrested and incarcerated for drug-related crime, experience more severe consequences from substance use, and are disproportionately exposed to criminogenic risk factors ? there are several areas regarding the confluence of these factors that have been understudied. For instance, how do these concomitant factors converge within individuals and across time? Moreover, despite the higher risk of experiencing these outcomes, many African Americans successfully adapt, and yet we know little about the factors that protect individuals from drug use, criminal offending, criminal justice system interaction, and their adverse consequences. In the proposed project we seek to increase our understanding of patterns, pathways and trajectories of drug use, criminal behavior, and criminal justice system interactions for urban African Americans as well as identify the factors that decrease their co-occurrence and negative health consequences. The SPECIFIC AIMS of the proposed work are: (1) Identify and map the life course interrelationship of drug use and criminal justice system involvement for men and women, examining overlapping trajectories from adolescence to midlife, determining co-occurring patterns at each life stage, and estimating reciprocal effects over time; (2) Establish the short and long-term consequences of drug use, arrest and incarceration and their multiplicative impact on health; (3) Determine the individual and contextual protective factors that reduce the risk of and association between drug use, crime and criminal justice system involvement, and their negative health consequences. Method: Data are from the Woodlawn Study, which has followed nearly all children entering first grade in 1966 in Woodlawn, a poor Chicago community (N=1242) to age 52. Information from mothers and teachers, and official school, criminal, and death records have been integrated with reports from cohort members themselves to build an unmatched collection of comprehensive life course data of a population not adequately captured in national data sets. The experienced and uniquely qualified research team will employ sophisticated analytical approaches used in longitudinal research, including trajectory analysis, survival analysis, latent class analysis, latent transition analysis, structural equation modeling, conjunctive analysis of case configurations, and propensity score methods. The one-of-a-kind dataset spanning more than 40 years allows for in-depth exploration of both risk and protection. Implications: The project will challenge assumptions of African American homogeneity and help reframe the current deficit conceptualization to focus instead on protective effects, positive outcomes and recovery. The research will make unique and important contributions to understanding patterns, pathways and reciprocal effects between drug use, crime, and criminal justice system interaction for both men and women over the life course. Findings will inform intervention development by identifying critical pivotal points of influence along the life course that may alter risk trajectories. ! !"

The RRC will fill this need by providing state-of-the-art core facilities and  developing a network of state and regional partnerships. The RRC has three specific aims. The first is to  maintain and enhance state-of-the-art core facilities for comparative functional genomics research, by way of  four centralized facility units at MDIBL made available to the ME-INBRE research community: DNA  Sequencing and Gene Expression Analysis, Imaging, Common Instrumentation, and Animal Services. The  second aim is to facilitate improved research instrumentation and technical expertise among ME-INBRE  institutions by way of an innovative instrument exchange program, and by providing technical training  workshops to promote the use of state-of-the-art technologies. The third aim is to build a network of IDeA  supported research cores within Maine, and promote in-state and Northeast IDeA region shared access to  modern instrumentation within core facilities. To that end the RRC will work with the COBRE programs in  Maine to create a working group of Maine IDeA Research Core Directors that will share best practices for  management and coordinate core usage within Maine and the Northeast IDeA region. The RRC will also  create and administer a Research Resources Core small grants program to support use of research cores in  Maine and in the Northeast IDeA region. All of these efforts will significantly enhance and accelerate  biomedical research as well as biomedical research training at undergraduate colleges and community  colleges in Maine."

"9516335","OVERALL: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Berkeley Superfund Research Center, in consultation with the Program's key stakeholders, has identified four complex problems associated with hazardous waste sites that have proven intractable to current methods. These problems are how to better assess: 1) cumulative impacts from multiple environmental stressors (e.g. chemical exposures, stress and obesity); 2) past exposures, especially early-life exposures and their contribution to risk; 3) the effects of chemical mixtures and their impact on remediation efforts; and, 4) the complex transformation of chemicals to reactive intermediates and their ability to act through multiple mechanistic pathways. Here we propose six interactive projects (4 biomedical and 2 engineering) and 5 cores that aim to address these four problems though original research, translation to appropriate end-users and community engagement efforts. We will focus on exposures to high priority chemicals commonly found at Superfund sites, including arsenic, benzene, trichloroethene, formaldehyde, chromium and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to address the specific mandates of the Program. We will, however, take a novel approach in adopting the so-called `exposome paradigm' in our research. This new paradigm, which we helped develop, allows for a `seeing the whole picture' approach to risk assessment, hazard identification and the safe and effective remediation of hazardous sites containing multiple chemicals. In the exposome paradigm all non- genetic environmental stressors are considered as environmental exposures. Therefore, cumulative risk assessment, where the impact of all stressors on a population is assessed, could be operationalized by exposomics. Communities living near sites face cumulative risks from a variety of environmental and social factors. The theme of our Center is therefore the exposome and we propose a step-wise approach to applying exposomics to help solve the complex problems found at Superfund sites. Biomedical Projects 1-4 aim to develop advanced techniques for the detection, assessment, and evaluation of the effects and risk to human health of hazardous substances; Engineering Project 5 will develop methods to detect new hazardous substances in the environment and together with Engineering Project 6 will develop methods to reduce the amount and toxicity of hazardous substances. A Community Engagement Core C (CEC) will address contaminated drinking water problems in California in collaboration with Projects 1, 5 and 6 and Core E, a Data Science and Laboratory Core that will assist researchers and the CEC in meeting their goals. A Research Translation Core C will facilitate interactions between investigators and key stakeholders and a Training Core D will develop the next generation of multidisciplinary professionals. The overall goal is to enhance understanding of the relationship between exposure and disease; provide usable tools to improve human health risk assessments; and, develop a range of prevention and remediation strategies to protect public health and the environment. The program will be overseen and coordinated by an Administration Core A."
"9476207","Project 3 Project Summary/Abstract Disruption of circadian rhythms in activity, sleep-wake cycle, and other physiologic parameters is a consequence of aging, and occurs prominently in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While circadian dysfunction is a major cause of morbidity in AD, it is unknown if it contributes to disease pathogenesis. Systemic circadian rhythms in mice and humans are regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which synchronizes peripheral oscillations of core clock genes in all organs with the light-dark cycle. Our preliminary data shows that genetic deletion of core circadian clock genes, which mediate circadian transcriptional oscillations, can cause neuronal oxidative stress and neurodegeneration, suggesting that disruption of whole- animal SCN-driven circadian rhythms might have deleterious effects in AD through clock gene dysregulation. Human pathologic studies suggest that the SCN is a site of neuropathology in AD, though the impact of SCN dysfunction on AD pathogenesis is unknown. The objective of this Project is to test the hypothesis that impaired SCN-mediated circadian rhythms will increase amyloid-beta (A?) pathology, synaptic injury, and oxidative stress in mouse models of AD and in human AD patients. We will examine how lesioning of the SCN, which abrogates systemic circadian rhythms in mice, alters sleep-wake parameters and circadian patterns of cortical and hippocampal gene expression in 2 mouse models of A? accumulation. We will determine if SCN lesioning accelerates A? plaque deposition in these mouse models, and examine if loss of SCN-mediated rhythms affects A?-induced synaptic injury, neuroinflammation, and oxidative damage. Finally, we will examine correlations between circadian patterns in activity (actigraphy) and cerebrospinal fluid markers of oxidative stress and AD pathology in older adults and individuals with preclinical AD. These studies are designed to reveal dysfunction of SCN-mediated circadian rhythms as a contributing factor in AD pathogenesis, suggesting that therapies targeting the circadian system might prevent or delay AD."
"9478531","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  (ABSTRACT) Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, lupus) is characterized by the generation of autoantibodies that promote tissue injury. Follicular B helper T (Tfh) cells, phenotypically and functionally distinct from other T-helper (Th) cell subsets, reside in B-cell follicles and germinal centers (GCs) of secondary lymphoid organs, where they are essential for B-cell proliferation and survival, immunoglobulin (Ig) affinity selection, and development of memory B and long-lived plasma cells. The regulation of Tfh cells, and how in turn these cells promote autoreactive B cell responses, are critical to understanding the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies in SLE, and ultimately, to determining therapeutic intervention. Tfh cells, and the GC B cells they help, persist in lupus with induction of autoreactive memory B cells and autoantibody-producing plasma cells, by contrast to their appropriate waning following immunization or acute infection. The chronicity of autoreactive Tfh- and B-cell responses in lupus, integral to the disease phenotype, is not well understood. To address this phenomenon, we chronologically analyzed the phenotype and transcriptional profiles of Tfh cells in lupus. Tfh-cell cytokine production was aberrantly regulatd in murine lupus, with persistent co-production of the canonical Tfh-cell cytokine IL-21, alongside interferon-? (IFN-?). We also found simultaneous IL-21 and IFN-? double-producing Tfh cells in in the kidneys of lupus-prone mice, and in the blood of SLE patients. Among the transcriptional changes we observed in lupus Tfh cells was development of a gene signature associated with signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 4, a risk allele strongly associated with the development of SLE that correlated with the maintenance and persistence of the aberrant cytokine producing Tfh cells. By contrast to immunization or acute infection in which Th-cell cytokine production resolves physiologically, in human and murine lupus it persists pathologically, with STAT4 signaling critical for maintenance. We hypothesize that the inflammatory milieu of lupus leads to STAT4-mediated transcriptional changes in Tfh cells causing them to acquire an aberrant pattern of cytokine production, which then promotes pathologic B-cell maturation with autoantibody production. Our plan in this competitive renewal application is to investigate this hypothesis, addressing how the evolving, aberrant Tfh-cell phenotype promotes autoreactive B cell maturation; assessing STAT4-mediated genomic regulation of Tfh cells in lupus; and examining the factors that promote STAT4 signaling in an effort to determine the drivers of the aberrant Tfh-cell phenotype in lupus. We will answer these questions using murine model systems, and to the extent possible, in parallel with experiments using cells from patients with SLE."
"9449277","Abstract: Hematophagous female mosquitoes transmit numerous devastating diseases, while feeding on human blood. A large enough blood-meal is essential for the development of eggs in a female mosquito, thereby interlinking reproduction, blood-feeding and pathogen transmission. Therefore, a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating egg development can play a critical role in advancement of mosquito control methods. In Aedes aegypti, the Dengue-, Zika- and Yellow fever- transmitting mosquito, two major insect hormones - the juvenile hormone (JH) and the 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), control the biphasic female mosquito reproductive cycle. The post eclosion (PE) or the pre-vitellogenic maturation phase is under the control of JH, a sesquiterpenoid. Whereas, the post blood meal (PBM) or the vitellogenic phase is mostly controlled by the ecdysteroid, 20E. Some aspects of the molecular basis of JH action has been deciphered in recent times. However, studies on the role of the intermediate factors within the JH/Met regulatory cascade, are ongoing. Gene activation by JH, in most cases, is mediated by direct DNA binding of the JH-receptor Methoprene-tolerant (Met). However, the repression mechanism by JH is indirect, through intermediate factors. This proposal is aimed towards further elucidation of the JH mediated gene activation and repression cascades. Investigation of the role of Krüppel homolog 1(Kr-h1), as a downstream factor of Met in mediating gene repression, and its cooperative action with the long-range repressor Hairy, will be one of the primary foci. The proposed comparative analysis of the chromatin landscapes of JH pathway target genes, should determine the contributions of the components such as Met, Hairy and Kr-h1, on the chromatin states of the target genes. Most studies, on the mechanism of 20E action, have focused on positive gene regulation through the Ecdysone Receptor (EcR). This proposal, is aimed mainly at deciphering the role of 20E and EcR in the previously unexplored area of negative gene regulation, during the vitellogenic period. We plan to elucidate the mechanism of direct and indirect negative regulation and identify co-repressor(s) and intermediate factor(s) of the 20E/EcR-mediated gene repression pathway. This study should potentially lead to identification of targets that can either be blocked or transformed to achieve reproductive control in female mosquitoes, thereby reining blood feeding and pathogen transmission."
"9681602","PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States, with a third of diagnoses attributed to modifiable risk factors including obesity and poor diet. Understanding the role of these risk factors in cancer development is crucial for the provision of appropriate public health guidance for cancer prevention. Breast cancer remains the highest incidence cancer among women in the United States, and incidence rates for endometrial cancer are projected to dramatically increase over the next decade. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory evidence suggests that diet may be relevant for breast and endometrial cancer prevention, although the evidence base lacks consistency, perhaps owing to imprecise dietary measures, and a failure to account for associations that may vary by tumor subtype. Furthermore, endometrial cancer is especially obesity-driven, but the underlying mechanisms have yet to be fully characterized. There is a need for better objective measures of diet, including dietary biomarkers, that can be used to improve dietary assessment. Metabolomics is a novel and emerging technology in molecular epidemiology that can be used to measure hundreds to thousands of circulating metabolites simultaneously, more than 200 of which have been recently linked to an individual?s diet and/or adiposity. Furthermore, metabolomics can be used to highlight biological mechanisms of interest in relation to disease. This novel technology is advancing rapidly, and much work is yet to be done in applying it in an epidemiologic context. To address this unmet need, I propose to apply metabolomics to understanding the relationships of diet and adiposity with female cancers. I will first quantify the relationship between circulating metabolites and habitually consumed foods in a feeding study with a gold-standard measure of diet (weighed food) among postmenopausal women in order to develop objective dietary biomarkers. Such work is critical for correct interpretation of any diet-related metabolite signals that may be observed in subsequent cancer studies. Next, I will measure the association between pre-diagnostic circulating diet-related metabolites and estrogen receptor- negative (ER-) breast cancer using nested case-control data from three prospective cohorts. ER- breast cancer is rare, aggressive and understudied. Consequently, the etiology is poorly understood, including potential dietary risk factors. Finally, I will determine whether pre-diagnostic circulating metabolites are associated with incident endometrial cancer, and their relation to diet or adiposity using nested case-control data from four prospective cohorts. No studies have explored metabolite signatures of endometrial cancer and their relation to adiposity and diet using data from US-based prospective studies. These studies may uncover unknown metabolic pathways involved in the etiology of breast and endometrial cancer that may also be applicable to other obesity-driven cancers, and identify key pathways for developing and evaluating targeted cancer prevention interventions."

"9544929","Project Summary One hallmark feature of chronic heart failure (CHF) is sodium and fluid retention. While the cardio-renal syndrome has been recognized, a comprehensive understanding of the precise cellular mechanisms contributing to sodium and water retention in CHF remains elusive. Renal denervation (RDN) has been shown to reduce sodium retention in rats and dogs with CHF. One of the key elements involved in renal sodium retention is activation of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) of principal cells in the collecting tubule. We have previously shown that ENaC subunit expressions and activity were increased in the kidneys from rats with CHF. We have recent evidence indicating that increased proteases in the tubular fluid may contribute to the enhanced renal ENaC activity, providing a novel mechanistic insight for sodium retention commonly observed in CHF. We have observed that in rats with CHF: 1) the levels of serine proteases were dramatically increased in the urine; 2) protease inhibitor treatment significantly abrogated the enhanced diuretic and natriuretic responses to ENaC inhibitor benzamil in rats with CHF. Furthermore, our preliminary data have shown that RDN decreased the levels of proteases in the urine, reduced protein expressions of ENaC subunits in the kidney of CHF rats, supporting the potential role of sympathetic nerve activation. Based on these data, we will test the hypothesis that RDN reduces renal sodium retention in CHF rats by modulation of the ENaC and protease-ENaC axis. In AIM 1 we will determine the contribution of RDN in the expression/inactivation of ENaC in rats with CHF rats. In AIM 2 we will determine the contribution of tubular proteases in activating ENaC in rats with CHF. These aims will be addressed in rats with CHF using complementary methodologies ranging from cellular to the whole animal level, including physiological measurement of sodium balance, ENaC activity, eletrophysiological recording, protease and ubiquitination of ENaC using molecular biology techniques. The successful completion of the proposed studies will provide significant new information and insight into the contribution of ENaC regulation in altered sodium balance in CHF and the therapeutic benefits of RDN on sodium fluid retention, endemic to CHF."
"9538266","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that represents the most common genetic cause of infant death. SMA is caused by reduced levels of functional survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein, leading to cell autonomous defects at the neuromuscular junctions, axon degeneration, and loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord. The ubiquitously expressed SMN protein has a well characterized essential function in the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) in all tissues, but it is still unclear to what extent pre-mRNA splicing defects contribute to SMA. It is a central question in the field why spinal motor neurons are more severely affected by low SMN protein levels than other cell types.  We and others have shown that SMN is also present in highly mobile multi-protein complexes that are actively transported along microtubules and actin filaments in axons of cultured neurons. More recently, we have discovered that axons of cultured SMN-deficient motor neurons have impaired localization of specific mRNA binding proteins (mRBPs) and mRNAs in axons that are known to play roles in axon growth. These findings have led us to hypothesize that SMN plays a critical role in the assembly and trafficking of messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) in neuronal processes that serve axonal growth and maintenance. However, how defects in these SMN-dependent processes may contribute to the SMA pathomechanism is still unknown.  With the goal to reveal mRNA processing defects in SMA and their contribution to the disease phenotype, we propose two specific aims: in Aim 1, we will uncover disease-specific molecular axonal defects by a de- tailed and comprehensive analysis of differences in the axonal transcriptome and proteome. The use of novel SMA patient stem cell-derived motor neurons and compartmentalized cultures will allow us for the first time to comprehensively catalogue SMA-specific defects in mRNA processing and their consequences on axon development, and identify ways to rescue these defects. These studies will provide insight into mRNA processing defects in SMA patient stem cell-derived motor neurons and how they contribute to axonal defects in vitro. In Aim 2, we will use cell type-specific tagging of ribosomes with the RiboTag system to thoroughly characterize differences in the ribosome-associated transcriptome in spinal cord motor neurons of SMA mouse models. We will characterize axonal localization of known SMN targets, and rescue these axonal defects in SMA mice via AAV9-based viral transduction of genes that enhance axonal mRNP localization. These experiments will allow for the first time the assessment of the spectrum of mRNA processing defects in spinal motor neurons from an SMA mouse model and how they contribute to the disease phenotype in vivo. This proposal is expected to both increase our understanding of human pathology in the neuromuscular sys- tem, and to facilitate the development of therapies that are specifically targeted at mRNA processing defects in motor neurons in SMA and related neuromuscular diseases."
"9693952","Overall - Project Summary/Abstract: The contamination of water and aquifer sediments with arsenic (As) is associated with major public health and environmental mitigation issues in the United States. At present, 823 of 1739 U.S. Superfund sites list As as a major contaminant; in addition millions of U.S. residents are unduly exposed due to naturally occurring As in their household well water. This proposal includes two biomedical and two geoscience projects that seek to address critically important issues that collectively aim to reduce As exposure and toxicity in exposed human populations in the U.S. and in Bangladesh, where much information can be learned that will benefit residents of the U.S. and elsewhere. The proposal builds on the strengths of our existing longitudinal cohort study of 35,000 adults in Bangladesh by examining dose-response relationships between As exposure (in the low-mid range) from contaminated food and water with incident cases (and sub-types) of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-malignant lung disease, as well as diabetes mellitus (DM). In addition, we will combine and meta-analyze data from Bangladesh, Taiwan, China (Inner Mongolia) and the U.S. (AZ, CO, ND, OK, SD) to refine the dose-response relationships between As exposure and CVD. We build off our previous observations that: a) As exposure is associated with deficits in child intelligence; and b) that folate, a B vitamin, facilitates As metabolism and elimination in adults. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial in 8-10 year old children in Bangladesh to test the hypothesis that folate+B12 supplementation can: a) lower blood As; and b) improve cognitive abilities in children.  Building on our previous geoscience research which indicates that in situ magnetite formation forms a diffuse barrier capable of long-term As retention, we propose to conduct laboratory and field research to optimize and implement this new approach at a U.S. Geological Survey research site on Cape Cod, MA and a Superfund site in Raleigh, NC. In Bangladesh, we will quantify the geographic and socio-political barriers to reducing As exposure by analyzing the vast data sets accumulated in our main study area and we will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing ways to overcome some of them. In parallel, we will continue to examine the potential vulnerability to human perturbations of shallow and deep aquifers that are low in As. These low As aquifers are crucial for reducing exposure to our study population and the country at large.  In the U.S., we will build on our proven success of partnering with state and local governments to reduce As exposure in communities that rely on As-contaminated household wells in ME, NJ and MN. We will also continue to facilitate effective communication among our SRP scientists, stakeholders and government partners via five specific strategies. Finally, we will continue to train the next generation of scientists with disciplinary and inter-disciplinary skills that will enable them to improve the health of those who reside in environments that might expose them to As and other contaminants in soil, water and food. "
"9594024","During the previous grant cycle we demonstrated that non-coding transcription orchestrates chromatin folding and compartmentalization to specify T cell fate. Briefly, we identified a non-coding RNA named ThymoD (thymocyte differentiation factor) located 20 kbp upstream of the Bcl11b enhancer. ThymoD- deficient mice displayed a defect at the onset of T cell development and developed lymphoid malignancies. We found ThymoD acts to reposition the Bcl11b enhancer from the lamina into the nuclear interior. The repositioning brings the Bcl11b enhancer and promoter into a single loop domain to permit efficient enhancer-promoter communication and activation of Bcl11b expression. This process involves multiple steps: (i) CTCF occupancy across the ThymoD locus and the Bcl11b promoter region, (ii) activation of cohesin-dependent looping to juxtapose the enhancer and promoter into a single loop domain that is anchored by CTCF sites in the ThymoD locus and the Bcl11b promoter region, (iii) repositioning the enhancer from a heterochromatic to an euchromatic environment and (iv) activation of Bcl11b expression and specification of T cell fate. Here we propose to continue these studies. We would describe in molecular terms how ThymoD orchestrates T cell fate. Specifically, we would examine whether and how CTCF occupancy and cohesin-dependent looping orchestrates chromatin folding and compartmentalization to bring the enhancer and promoter regions into a single loop domain. We would track Bcl11b locus topology during cohesin loss and cohesin recovery at high spatial and temporal resolution. We would examine how cohesin mediated loop extrusion directs compartmentalization, assembles the Bcl11b loop domain and induces a T-lineage specific program of gene expression. Taken together, these studies would reveal how non-coding transcription induced loop extrusion directs enhancer-promoter communication with great specificity to specify T cell fate."

"9476203","Core G: Genetics Project Summary/Abstract  One hundred years ago, dementing illnesses were classified based upon their clinical presentation and  neuropathology. The promise of the twenty-first century is that we will be able to classify these same diseases  by the genetic cause or genetic risk factors, a classification based upon etiology not symptomatology. During  the last two decades many genes have been shown to cause autosomal dominant forms of early onset  dementing illnesses. These rare disorders have provided enormous insight into the pathogenesis of more  common variants of the same diseases. In 1993, a polymorphism in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene was  identified as the first genetic risk factor for AD. A dose-dependent effect of the APOE4 allele has now become  an important variable in all studies of AD. During the last five years genome-wide association studies and next  generation sequencing studies have begun to identify many novel risk factors for AD. The goal of the Genetics  Core of the Knight ADRC is to provide genetic information and useful biological materials on all ADRC  participants. We will obtain family history data, plasma, serum, DNA, RNA, and APOE genotypes on all ADRC  participants. Blood samples on all participants will be sent to NCRAD. Many participants will also have GWAS,  exome array and whole exome/genome sequence data through national and international initiatives and ADRC  affiliated projects held by Drs. Goate and Cruchaga. These data will be stored in the master ADRC database  and provided to investigators upon request. We will identify and assess novel multiplex kindreds. Families that  meet criteria for other funded projects such as DIAN, NIA-LOAD and LEFFTDS will be invited to participate in  these studies.

"9476157","Project Summary Cerebrovascular disease is a major source of stroke. However, clinicians treating patients with intracranial vascular disease are often in a quandary as to the most effective treatment as the underlying pathophysiology and likely progression is obscure. Until recently, non-invasive evaluation of the source of pathology - the vessel wall - was not possible. Although advances in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology show potential for vessel wall imaging (VWI), the true performance metrics of these approaches are poorly defined. The true resolution and the characterization of wall components, specifically inflammatory components, have not been established and vary among practitioners. This project will implement new approaches to in vivo intracranial VWI using high field strength MRI (at 3T and 7T). This goal will be achieved with theoretical design and simulations, in vitro models, in vivo implementation, with histology validation. First: we will optimize high-resolution (sub 0.5mm isotropic) 3D black blood fast-spin-echo MRI (termed SPACE on Siemens platforms) at 3T and 7T for whole brain intracranial VWI. The vessel wall signal to noise ratio, sharpness, and contrast to surrounding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain parenchyma will be simulated and optimized. This will be validated on in vitro models and with in vivo scanning of 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with intracranial vascular disease. We will also implement compressed sensing method to reduce the scan time of the long acquisition (currently around 10 minutes) to make it clinically feasible. Second: 3D SPACE, Ultra-short echo time (UTE) sequences and T2* mapping/quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) methods for detecting inflammation using Ultra-Small Super-Paramagnetic Iron Oxide (USPIO) contrast agents will be developed and validated in USPIO phantoms with a range of concentrations. These methods will be optimized to detect USPIO uptake in 10 patients with intracranial plaques, and the best approaches will be determined. Confirmation of the location of uptake assessed on imaging performed immediately prior to scheduled surgery will be sought on histology in 10 patients with intracranial aneurysms. Third: The ability of 3T imaging to characterize high-risk vessel wall features (such as intraplaque hemorrhage, intra-luminal thrombus, gadolinium enhancement, and USPIO uptake) will be assessed compared to scanning at 7T on 30 patients with cerebrovascular disease. Successful project conduct will provide methods to characterize the high-risk features of the intracranial vessel wall that could be clinically used to evaluate risk of stroke on a patient-specific basis and with a tool for validation across vendor platforms. These methods could be used to guide patient-specific therapy and improve stroke outcome ? directly supporting the mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute."
"9446883","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to tell time, predict the movement of other animals, and decode complex temporal patterns- such as those in speech-are among the brain's primary functions. As such, we would put forth that it will not be possible to understand the fundamental principles underlying brain function without understanding how the brain tells time and processes temporal information. We have proposed that precisely because timing is such a fundamental component to brain function that neural circuits in general are capable of processing temporal information-that is, timing does not rely on specialized or centralized circuits. This theory posits that timing emerges from the neural dynamics of recurrent neural circuits, and predicts that even neural circuits in vitro may be able to learn to tell time.  We hae recently provided evidence that timing is a general computation of cortical networks. Specifically, by chronically exposing slices in the incubator to patterned stimuli (mimicking sensory experience) we have shown that the neural dynamics reproduces the temporal features of the experienced stimuli. Here we will use novel electrical and optogenetic methods to demonstrate that cortical circuits in vitro can learn temporal patterns, and elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms of timing and cortical computations. We propose that studying network-level forms of learning in reduced preparations is necessary to understand cortical computations because of the limitations of in vivo studies. Additionally, the ability to study network behavior and `learning' in vitro will provide a means to study pathological circuit level computations using tissue from animal models of cognitive disorders."
"9484152","Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  This project is the R00 phase of a K99/R00 award to be completed in the Department of Pharmacology and Physiology at George Washington University. In this project, I will investigate the role of inhibitory synapses on VTA dopamine neurons in animal models of resilience and susceptibility to stress-induced anhedonia. Dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are a crucial part of the brain's reward processing system, and function of these neurons is greatly influenced by stress. In particular, activity of dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens has been causally linked to an animal's behavioral response to stress. Inhibitory synapses onto dopamine neurons powerfully modulate their activity, and are thus poised to be a significant mediator of stress's effects on the VTA. In this proposal, I will take a multidisciplinary approach, utilizing electrophysiological, optogenetic, chemogenetic, and behavioral techniques to address the hypothesis that inhibitory synapses onto nucleus accumbens-projecting VTA dopamine neurons are a key determinant of an individual's behavioral responses to stress. I propose two aims, revised from my original K99/R00 application. In the first, I will examine inhibitory synaptic physiology and plasticity onto nucleus accumbens projecting dopamine neurons in mice exhibiting differential responses to two forms of repeated stress: chronic social defeat and subchronic variable stress. In the second, I will examine changes in the strength of two specific inputs (local VTA interneurons and RMTg projections) onto nucleus accumbens-projecting dopamine neurons following chronic social defeat and the ability of chemogenetic manipulation of these inputs to promote resilience to this stressor. These studies hold the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of how the reward system is altered by stress and may lead to novel avenues for the development of therapeutic treatments for depression and other stress-linked disorders."
"9562870","Diabetes (DM) shortens lifespan, an impact that is not fully explained by traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. Functional Exercise Capacity (FEC) is a universal predictor of CV and all-cause mortality and it is decreased in people with diabetes. The overall goal of our combined basic and clinical research program is to understand and treat impaired FEC in DM to prevent premature mortality. New data from our lab indicate that: Oxygen delivery uniquely limits in vivo muscle mitochondrial function in DM (human); Modeling of muscle blood flow distribution reveals that the contributions of reduced flow and capillary density were minor relative to the contributions of heterogeneous flow distribution (rodent) ; Targeting of nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide (NOS/NO) or glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) impacts FEC (running distance) and demonstrate a correlation between muscle perfusion (blood flow, capillary density and blood flow distribution) and oxygen consumption. Hypothesis: Microvascular perfusion heterogeneity contributes to diabetes mediated muscle fatigue, decreased muscle VO2 and impaired FEC and these endpoints will improve with two different agents that improve muscle blood flow distribution -GLP-1 or Nitrites. SA#1: To test the hypothesis that will GLP-1 and Nitrites will prevent or restore hyperglycemia- mediated muscle perfusion heterogeneity, muscle fatigue and decreased muscle VO2: This aim will employ a mouse model with inducible hyperglycemia to examine the impact of hyperglycemia on muscle perfusion, muscle fatigue and muscle VO2. The second set of experiments will test the ability of GLP-1 or Nitrites, targeting eNOS/NO by different mechanisms, to prevent or restore these endpoints. SA#2: To examine the ability of GLP-1 or Nitrites to improve DM FEC and to augment the impact of exercise training: We will determine the impact of GLP-1 or Nitrites on exercise performance with and without hyperglycemia and exercise training. These experiments will address the overall hypothesis by exploring the impact of GLP-1 or Nitrites on FEC and the exercise training response. SA#3: To define the importance of GLP-1 receptors for muscle perfusion heterogeneity and function and for the adaptation to exercise training: Published and preliminary data indicate that GLP-1 can augment adaptation to exercise training and pilot data demonstrate that the GLP-1 receptor antagonist interferes with the adaptive exercise training response. These studies will clarify whether endothelial cell GLP-1 receptors are required for cardiometabolic adaptation to exercise training. Impact of these studies on the Veteran Population: Diabetes decreases life expectancy and is highly prevalent in Veterans. Successful execution of this research program will provide critical preclinical data for interventions that may acutely improve function and increase the impact of physical activity on cardiovascular health in people with diabetes."
"9590370","PROJECT SUMMARY  Background: Acute rejection of renal transplant, i.e., the immunological response of the human body to a foreign kidney, is the main cause of dysfunction in renal transplant patients, surpassing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and immune drug toxicity. Over 650,000 patients in the US have end-stage renal disease and renal transplant offers the best outcome for these patients. However, 15%-27% of renal transplant patients have ARTR within 5 years, which if not detected and treated promptly, causes renal damage and leads to renal failure of the transplanted kidney. Currently, ARTR is initially evaluated using blood tests and urine sampling, e.g., plasma creatinine and creatinine clearance. However, these indices have low sensitivity, since a significant change in creatinine levels is only detectable after the loss of 60% of renal function. ARTR diagnosis requires renal biopsy (gold standard), which is invasive, takes a week for diagnosis, and costs up to $20,000. Further, needle biopsy is prone to over- or under-estimation of inflammation. The proposed study seeks to develop and validate a new noninvasive computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) software system that can provide highly accurate (over 97% accuracy) diagnosis of ARTR at an early stage by integrating laboratory-based biomarkers (e.g., creatinine clearance (CrCl) and serum plasma creatinine (SPCr)) with imaging-markers that will be extracted from either dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) or diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI).  Objective/Hypotheses: The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a clinically usable system for the early detection of acute renal transplant rejection (ARTR) based on testing the following three hypotheses: (i) The perfusion of the contrast agent in the cortex of the rejected kidney is slower than the perfusion of the contrast agent in the non-rejected kidney; (ii) The estimated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the cortex of the rejected kidney is smaller than the estimated ADC in the cortex of the non-rejected kidney; and (iii) Fusing laboratory-based biomarkers (e.g., CrCl and SPCr) with imaging-markers that will lead to novel fused indices for distinguishing rejected versus non-rejected kidneys in clinical decision-making.  Specific Aims: (i) Develop a software CAD system for early detection of acute renal transplant rejection based on integrating/fusing the estimated physiological perfusion parameters from DCE-MRI data with laboratory-based biomarkers for both rejected and non-rejected transplanted kidneys; (ii) Develop a software CAD system for early detection of acute renal transplant rejection based on integrating/fusing the estimated physiological diffusion parameters from DW-MRI data with laboratory-based biomarkers for both rejected and non-rejected transplanted kidneys; and (iii) Evaluate the accuracy of the proposed image analysis software system with clinical data that will be collected at University of Louisville (Approved IRB # 16.0041), University of Michigan (Approved IRB # HUM00115031), and the collected MRI data at The Kidney transplant center at Mansoura University with local regulatory approval.  Study Design: We will develop the following image analysis techniques to accurately analyze both DCE- MRI and DW-MRI: (i) segmentation of the kidney object from the surrounding abdominal structures for either DCE-MRI or DW-MRI using appearance and prior shape models; (ii) a Laplace-based non-rigid registration approach to handle local deformations in the kidney region caused by physiological effects (e.g., intrinsic pulsatile effects, breathing, or transmitted effects from adjacent structures, such as the bowel) during the data collection; (iii) segmentation of the kidney cortex and generation of either the physiological perfusion parameters (e.g., wash-in slope, wash-out slope, time-to-peak, and peak value) or physiological diffusion parameters (e.g., ADC); (iv) classification of the acute rejection versus non-rejection kidney status and evaluating the method as a diagnostic test; and (v) depiction of parametric maps of the estimated perfusion or diffusion indices to help clinical visual assessment of the transplanted kidney. The MRI and clinical data will be obtained from patients who have undergone kidney transplantation from live donors, and are available to our research team via Dr. Beache and Dr. Dwyer (Radiology Department and The Kidney Transplant Center at the University of Louisville, respectively) and Dr. Samaniego-Picota (Director of the Kidney Transplant Program and the Transplant Ambulatory Care Unit at the University of Michigan). In addition to the data that will be collected at the University of Louisville and the University of Michigan, our group has access to MRI data that had been collected from an additional 100 subjects at Mansoura University Hospital, Egypt. This data is available to our group through Dr. Abou El-Ghar, one of the PI collaborators, and it will be used to test the proposed CAD system on the data collected from another geographical area. Our preliminary diagnostic results, based on analysis of DCE-MRI data from 54 independent in-vivo cases using leave-one-subject-out approach were 98% accurate (sensitivity = 100.00%, specificity = 96%, and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) = 98%). Moreover, our preliminary results, based on the analysis of DW-MRI data from 75 independent in-vivo cases using leave-one-subject-out were 97% accurate (sensitivity = 98%, specificity = 96%, and DSC = 98%). These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed CAD system to complement current technologies such as nuclear imaging and ultrasonography to determine the type of kidney dysfunction post transplantation."
"9479138","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ADPKD is characterized by the presence of numerous fluid-filled cysts, which grow in size over time and produce kidney failure. Despite recent progress, pathogenesis of ADPKD is not fully understood, and no FDA-approved drugs are available. Majority of ADPKD patients develop cysts due to complete loss-of- function of PKD1 or 2. However, new evidence indicates that some ADPKD patients harbor hypomorphic mutations, and they develop cysts due to reduced PKD1 or 2 gene dosage. Another new theme is that reduced dosage of several gene products within the `cystic pathway' aggravates the ADPKD phenotype. These observations suggest that improving the expression of PKD1, PKD2 and other `cystic pathway genes' represents an exciting new therapeutic opportunity to suppress cyst growth. miRNAs are unique drug targets in this regard as they can be inhibited to simultaneously increase the expression of multiple cystic pathway genes. RATIONALE: The role of miRNAs in ADPKD largely remains unexplored. We have recently showed that: (i) miR-17~92 is up-regulated in models of PKD; (ii) kidney-specific overexpression of miR-17~92 in normal mice produces cysts; and (iii) importantly, inhibition of miR-17~92 in a mouse model of PKD suppresses cyst growth. Interestingly, many cystic kidney disease genes are predicted to be miR-17~92 targets. Thus, inhibition of the miR-17~92 may be a potential new therapeutic strategy for PKD. However, validating miR-17~92 as a therapeutic target requires that its role is studied in orthologous mouse models that resemble the human ADPKD phenotype of adult-onset, slowly-growing cysts. HYPOTHESIS: Increased levels of miR-17~92 promote cyst growth in ADPKD by reducing the dosage of multiple gene products in the cystic pathway. AIMS: We will use complementary genetic and pharmaceutical approaches to determine whether inhibition of miR-17~92 retards cyst growth and increases the expression of target cystic kidney disease genes in orthologous models of ADPKD. To provide relevance to human disease, we will determine whether miR- 17~92 is up-regulated and the target cystic kidney disease genes are downregulated in human ADPKD samples. Finally, we will determine whether miR-17-mediated inhibition of Pkd1 and Pkd2 is sufficient and necessary to promote cyst growth in vivo."

"9481843","Program Summary/Abstract  This T32 renewal application requests funds over five years to support six (6) predoctoral traineeships in population research at the Center for Demography and Ecology (CDE) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Since 1962, CDE has offered a world-class training program in population science (with nearly continuous NICHD T32 funding since 1975). Our graduates are among the leaders in population research today, serving in a range of academic, government and applied research settings. Guided by the NICHD mission ?to ensure the health, productivity, independence, and well-being of all people,? CDE research is organized around five major areas: 1) Fertility, families & households; 2) the Demography of Inequality; 3) Health & mortality; 4) Biodemography; and 5) Environmental and spatial demography. Our training objectives?and associated research activities?fall squarely under the Population Dynamics Branch which ?supports research and research training in demography, reproductive health, and population health.?  The primary goals of the CDE training program in demography are: (1) to foster an interdisciplinary community of junior scholars in population research; (2) to build expertise in demographic theory, methods, and analysis; and (3) to cultivate students' professional skills, including the organization, execution, presentation, publication, and critique of research. Within the CDE training program, the process of developing this expertise involves four essential components: (1) formal training via coursework in students' home departments and interdisciplinary coursework in other departments; (2) exposure to cutting-edge research of scholars in the broader community of population studies, primarily through the weekly Demography Seminar (`DemSem'); (3) participation and collaboration in substantive research projects of CDE training faculty through an apprenticeship model; and (4) professional socialization and integration into the field of population studies, especially via the weekly Demography Training Seminar.  Predoctoral T32 trainees are typically appointed in the second or third year in their PhD program, having shown clear academic promise and a strong commitment to pursuing a population research-related career; most students come from Sociology, Economics and Population Health (although we are increasingly recruiting from a broader range of disciplines), and they typically receive T32 funding for two to three years. We are requesting 6 predoctoral training slots (1 more than our current allocation) because our program has continued to grow in size, scope and quality. Our training efforts have expanded to focus on interdisciplinary research areas at the forefront of social science (especially biodemography and spatial/environmental demography), and we have been very successful at recruiting even larger numbers of highly-competitive students into our broader training program. For the 2016-17 academic year, 8 top-notch, first-year students in Sociology and several enrolled students in Economics and Population Health will join our existing group of 26 demography trainees. Having a critical mass of T32 traineeships ensures that we can continue to support our most outstanding students in what we believe is one of the best available environments for predoctoral training in population research."
"9442844","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary DNA replication checkpoint is a highly conserved signaling pathway in all eukaryotes. It plays a critical role in maintaining the DNA synthesis function of perturbed replication forks under stress. Perturbed forks, if undetected by the checkpoint, undergo catastrophic collapse resulting in chromosomal DNA damage or even cell death. Defects in the pathway are linked to genome instability and cancer. However, despite its importance and intense research efforts, our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the initiation of checkpoint signaling at the pertubed forks, fork stabilization, and cell survival remains incomplete. The long-term goal of our research is to understand the molecular interactions between the replication machinery and the checkpoint pathways for proper checkpoint signaling and fork protection by using S. pombe as the model system. The objective here is to define the important checkpoint functions of DNA polymerase Pol ?, the replicative helicase CMG, and the sterol synthesis enzyme Erg11 (Cyp51 in humans). Our central hypotheses are (1) that the activated replication checkpoint targets Pol ? and CMG on the leading strand to suppress the fork progression under stress and hence protect the perturbed forks against catastrophic collapse, and (2) that Erg11 may function as a new sensor of the stress induced by the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea. Our hypotheses are the results of our strong preliminary data and recent publications. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the checkpoint functions of these essential enzymes will provide novel insights into how the replication checkpoint signaling is initiated and how perturbed forks are stabilized for cell survival, the two most prominent questions in the field. Guided by strong preliminary data, these hypotheses will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) determine how Pol ? is regulated by the checkpoint for stabilization of perturbed forks; (2) discover the major target() of the replication checkpoint for cell survival under stress; and (3) define the functions of Erg11 in checkpoint signaling and hydroxyurea-induced cytokinesis arrest. Under the first two aims, we will conduct in vitro and in vivo studies to investigate how the activties of Pol ? and CMG are regulated by the chekcpoint for fork protection and cell survival. We will also systematically analyze all replication proteins in fission yeast in order to identify the major checkpoint target() that may work alone or redundantly with the known targets. Under the third aim, the newly identified functions of Erg11 in checkpoint signaling and cytokinesis will be characterized. The approach is innovative, because it aims to provide a comprehensive molecular mechanism for checkpoint signaling in a model system representative of higher eukaryotes. The proposal is significant, because it is expected to vertically advance and expand our understanding of how checkpoint signaling is generated at perturbed forks and how perturbed forks are protected. Ultimately, such knowledge will advance our understanding of how genomic integrity is maintained and how it can be disrupted in all eukaryotes."
"9460430","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exercise builds skeletal strength by inducing new bone formation, which is accompanied by decreased marrow adipose tissue (MAT). A lack of exercise enhances MSC adipogenesis, and increased MAT has been shown to be associated with bone fragility. Understanding mechanisms by which exercise regulates mdMSC lineage allocation to increase osteogenesis and decrease adipogenesis is thus significant for managing skeletal health in an increasingly sedentary population. We have shown that mechanical activation and nuclear trafficking of ßcatenin prevents adipogenesis and promotes MSC entry into osteoprogenitor lineage. ßcatenin signaling is initiated by recruitment of Fyn kinase to foca adhesions during strain, followed by Fyn activation of the mTORC2->Akt->GSK3ß inhibition cascade leading to increased ßcatenin. ßcatenin effects depend on cellular context: in mdMSC, increased cytoskeletal structure improves osteogenesis and cytoskeletal deficiency promotes adipogenesis. The Fyn/mTORC2 proximal signal also activates RhoA to build complexity and connectivity of the cytoskeleton. We propose that mechanically induced cytoskeletal reorganization promotes nuclear entry of ßcatenin, underwriting its anti-adipogenic, pro-osteogenic effect. Importantly, the role of focal adhesion-based Fyn in initiating ßcatenin and RhoA effectors may be unique to the mdMSC, potentially providing a specific pharmacologic target to enhance MSC response to exercise. To test this, we will delineate the synergistic contributions of Fyn/mTORC2's two downstream effectors, RhoA and ßcatenin, to MSC lineage fate allocation in vitro and in vivo. We will find if RhoA generated cytoskeletal reorganization is necessary or sufficient to alter mdMSC cell fate and define how mechanical load activates RhoA (SA1). In SA2, we ask if activation of ßcatenin can alter cell fate in the face of cytoskeletal deficiency, inquiring whether the cytoskeleton drives nuclear/cytoplasmic partitioning of ßcatenin and considering if the actin-nesprin-LINC-nuclear tether might guide ßcatenin into the nucleus. In SA3, using an innovative method to quantify and localize MAT, combined with measures of bone formation, we will investigate mechanical control of mdMSC lineage in vivo, asking if the Fyn/mTORC2 signaling unique to mdMSC is critical during exercise stimulation of bone formation; for this we will generate a Tamoxifen driven Prx1-Cre knock out of Fyn."
"9424238","PROJECT SUMMARY: Synaptopathy, loss of functional synapse between hair cells and their afferent neurons, is thought to be of central importance in the development of auditory deficits such as speech perception and sound discrimination in noisy environments. Noise exposure during the lifetime is thought to be an important contributing factor to synaptopathy. Investigation of this problem is difficult in humans in part due to the difficulty confirming loss of auditory synapses in living humans and the limited knowledge of the effects of biological variables such as age on noise-induced synaptopathy. Importantly, synaptopathy can experimentally investigated in animal models such as mice, which have emerged as a leading research tool in auditory neuroscience. The overall objective of the proposed experiments is to identify age-dependent effects of noise exposure in a mouse model of noise-induced synaptopathy. The proposed studies will apply a battery of well-defined psychoacoustic tests in a well-controlled mouse model of synaptopathy. The mouse model affords us the opportunity to screen animals exposed as young or older adults to synaptopathy-inducing noise on behavioral and electrophysiological measures to detect dysfunction in addition to performing anatomical assays to confirm the pattern of auditory nerve synapse loss and central reorganization. We will pursue our objective through three aims: 1) Measure the effects of noise exposure on the perception of spectral, temporal, and intensity cues in young and old mice; 2) Measure the effects of noise exposure on the perception of spectrotemporally complex stimuli; 3) Measure central gain compensation and the underlying changes in synaptic reorganization in the auditory brainstem. We will test for synaptopathy-related perceptual deficits in young and old mice trained to detect or discriminate sounds in quiet and noise. Our preliminary data indicate that old- exposed mice cannot recover as well as younger-exposed mice, and we hypothesize that this is due to reduced central compensation in the older brain. Auditory nerve synapse numbers will be quantified in all mice so that behavioral and physiological response patterns can be correlated with patterns of peripheral synapse loss and central reorganization. The experiments outlined here will reveal a suite of behavioral measures that can be used by clinicians to reveal synaptopathy in human patients and will identify whether or not ABRs can be optimized to detect synaptopathy."
