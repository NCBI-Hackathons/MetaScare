"9573915","Abstract The ability to infect non-dividing cells is what separates lentiviruses, including HIV-1, from other retroviruses which require the breakdown of the nuclear envelope during cell division to access the genome of target cells. Lentiviruses, in contrast, have evolved the ability to selectively translocate their genome across the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Unfortunately, the mechanism by which HIV-1 translocates through the NPC remains one of the least well understood aspect of the viral lifecycle, in large part because there is no direct, definitive method to monitor HIV-1 nuclear import. In this application, we describe a method to monitor HIV-1 nuclear import kinetics directly through the ability to selectively and potently inhibit HIV-1 nuclear import at various times post-infection. This method prevents infection of any viruses which have not yet traversed the NPC and entered the nucleus, and thereby allows us to directly monitor the kinetics of nuclear import by measuring the fraction of the viral inoculum which has cleared the NPC at times following a synchronized infection. As such, this assay provides a unique opportunity to appreciate nuclear translocation of the viral genome in target cells, including primary cells, and to determine how specific viral determinants and cellular factors influence the nuclear translocation of the viral genome."
"9623604","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite the ability of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) to reduce disease-related morbidity and mortality in HIV-1 infection, viral reservoirs persist. Identification of non-viral markers associated with HIV-1 infection that can be used as a therapeutic or diagnostic target is a top research priority. Here, we demonstrate that CD30, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, is preferentially expressed on the surface of HIV-infected peripheral blood CD4+ T cells and that and HIV-1 transcriptional activity is co-localized within blood and gut tissues from participants on suppressive ART. In some individuals, HIV-1 DNA or RNA was exclusively recovered from cells expressing CD30. In further preliminary studies, ex vivo treatment with brentuximab vedotin, an FDA approved monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets CD30, resulted in up to a 4 log10 reduction in cell-associated HIV-1 DNA in samples obtained from individuals on ART. Despite these exciting data, several important questions remain. The stability of expression of CD30 and on latently infected blood and tissue-derived cells and the tissue burden and phenotypic relationships between CD30+ cells with other immune cell phenotypes is poorly understood. Even if CD30 expression waxes and wanes in infected cells, continued exposure to CD30 targeted therapies could progressively eliminate much of the reservoir. More potent reductions in HIV burden would be expected in the setting of concomitant anti-C30 therapy and latency reversal. The timing of this proposal is key as there are novel anti-CD30 therapies, such as CD16/CD30 bispecific antibodies to elicit antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, in clinical development.  We hypothesize that CD30 expression is stably expressed on HIV-infected, tissue-resident cells and will provide a specific therapeutic or immune target for HIV eradication. These tissue-resident cells can exist in a privileged immune environment and are likely to express markers of T cell activation and immune checkpoint/exhaustion and share features of TFH cells, an important source of persistent HIV. Results from prior cancer studies indicate that expression of key retrovrial regulatory proteins may lead to increased surface CD30 expression. However, latently infected cells may also stably express CD30, as we have observed several ART-suppressed individuals with a large majority of HIV-1 DNA recovered from CD30+ lymphocytes. Our aims are to: (1) determine if CD30 is preferentially and stably expressed on HIV-infected peripheral blood and tissue resident cells in individuals on suppressive ART treated during very early or late infection; (2) determine if ex vivo administration of brentuximab vedotin in conjunction with latency reversal will lead to significant reductions in intact cell-associated HIV DNA in PBMC from ART-suppressed individuals, and (3) determine if CD30 is continuously expressed following development of HIV latency, and define unique transcriptional signatures of HIV infected cells expressing CD30. Determining these signatures will inform on how to maximize CD30 expression on HIV infected cells and to drive future mechanistic studies."
"9524549","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 40 million children and adults in the US suffer from chronic pulmonary diseases including asthma, chronic bronchitis and obstructive pulmonary disease. Asthma alone accounts for 25 million cases, with prevalence increasing by 10% each decade. Combination inhaled corticosteroids (ICs) are the treatment of choice for the long-term management of breathing symptoms. Regrettably, ICs are also associated with voice disorders in up to 50% of cases. These disorders become chronic, impair communication, and have significant adverse occupational, financial, and psychosocial consequences. Given the prevalence of voice disorders associated with combination ICs since chlorofluorocarbon-propelled inhalers were banned in 2008, compelling clinical evidence necessitates a new research initiative to address this critical threat to public health. The long-term goal of this research program is to prevent and cure voice disorders associated with combination ICs across the lifespan. Children placed on inhalers face lifelong, possibly permanent communication impairment. Determining the pathophysiology of IC-related voice disorders is the critical next step to developing new voice-sparing asthma drugs. It is essential to determine the pathophysiology of voice disorders associated with combination ICs, to treat, reverse, and prevent these voice changes. This project accomplishes these objectives in 3 hypothesis-driven aims. Aim 1 determines structural laryngeal biomarkers of IC use associated with voice disorders in children and adults with the 2 most common phenotypes of asthma (high TH2 allergic and low TH2 primarily eosinophilic). Aim 2 quantifies voice disorder onset and reversibility for ICs versus sham using an in vivo animal model. Aim 3 examines the pathogenesis of IC-related voice disorders via examination of cytokines associated with inflammation (IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-?) from animal true vocal folds and human false vocal folds. Collectively, these aims define the pathophysiology associated with IC-related voice disorders, laying the foundation for voice disorder cure and prevention in this population. This translational project will have immediate and significant clinical implications, making a powerful and sustained impact in the field of communication disorders."

"9489294","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PETAL RFA is an exciting initiative to create a multi-disciplinary network that can develop and conduct multi-center clinical trials to evaluate promising therapies and approaches for preventing and/or treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We propose participation in this network. The lead institution for this proposal is Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), and satellite sites are Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the University of Mississippi. In aggregate, our site possesses a uniquely strong track record of pre- existing collaboration between emergency medicine, anesthesiologists and intensive care physicians, as well as between our individual study sites. This experience and expertise directly addresses the intent of the proposal. Our research team has a sustained, proven track record of successful, high-impact studies in sepsis and ARDS spanning emergency medicine, perioperative medicine and critical care. Our site is already serves as the coordinating center for the Lung Injury Prevention Trial with Aspirin (LIPS-A) which is in many ways the prototype for the type of study envisioned for the PETAL network. Thus, we are ideally positioned to create an extremely high-performing PETAL clinical center, as well as to contribute to network leadership and scientific direction.         We also submit two proposals for clinical studies to be undertaken by the PETAL network. Both of these studies are based upon strong preliminary data from our institutions. The first study will examine the ability of rosuvastatin to prevent development of ARDS in patients at risk for development of the syndrome. While statin drugs have previously been tested as a treatment for ARDS there is substantial evidence to suggest that they may be more effective as a prevention strategy. This study builds on our success as the clinical coordinating center of the LIPS-A study. Our second proposed study will test the ability of using personalized physiology, the patient's own pleural pressure as measured using esophageal balloons, to set the level of positive end-expiratory pressure in patients with established ARDS. This proposal will support a phase 3 trial of this promising modality.         The expertise and experience of the investigators involved in this proposal will allow the BIDMC clinical site to contribute substantially to the scientific success of the PETAL network."
"9601426","ABSTRACT Genetic variation between men and women predisposes differences in their responses to infection. For example, women respond much more vigorously to agents and vaccines including influenza, toxoplasmosis, and legionella, and are more prone to developing autoimmune disorders including Grave's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE). The molecular bases of sex differences in immunity and diseases of the immune system are unknown, although the presence of key immune modulatory genes on the X chromosome suggests a basis for sex-specific responses. The importance of sex-specific factors has been recognized by the National Institutes of Health, which changed its policies to require investigators to address and report differences between the sexes in pre-clinical studies. In this regard, we have observed that mature mIg+ B cells of mice express high levels of Serine/Arginine-specific Protein Kinase 3, a PKC-like kinase encoded by an X-linked gene. We propose that SRPK3 regulates humoral immunity in humans and mice. Using mice with floxed Srpk3 genes that delete specifically in B cells (using Cd79a-Cre), we observed that SRPK3 is necessary for efficient T-independent (TI) type 2 antibody responses against the model antigen NP-Ficoll. Preliminary experiments also suggest graded antibody responses in female mice with different gene dosage of Srpk3 (Srpk3+/+, Srpk3+/?, and Srpk3?/?). We hypothesize that SRPK3 is required for appropriate antibody responses, which are disrupted in its absence due to aberrant pre-mRNA splicing and the lack of SRPK3-mediated phosphorylation. To address this hypothesis, we will determine requirements for SRPK3 in responses to model antigens and identify targets of the kinase in pre-mRNA splicing and the phosphorylated proteome in marginal zone B cells. We conclude that the loss of SRPK3 function results in significant immunodeficiencies in males and females."
"9472980","In this proposal, I seek an extension of my MERIT award. The aims of the current funding period were: 1) To assess telomere-initiated cellular senescence in vivo; 2) To investigate heterochromatin-associated  senescence states. 3) To study the upregulation of p16. In the 3 years and 8 months since the start of this funding cycle, our projects have evolved from a predominant focus on cellular senescence to a much  stronger connection with in vivo organismal aging. We do not wish to imply that cellular senescence is not  relevant for aging, but rather that our research has led us in directions that include significant components of chronological aging. Our work has coalesced along 2 predominant themes: 1) Physiological changes that accompany a lifespan extension elicited by a hypomorphic allele of the ubiquitous c-Myc transcription factor; 2) Age-associated epigenetic changes that lead to chromatin remodeling, and other genome-wide changes. The first project is based on the remarkable discovery that mice heterozygous for a knockout of the c-myc gene have an extended lifespan. We have completed an extensive demographic analysis  showing that both median and maximum lifespans are increased in both sexes: 10-11% in males, and 17% in females. In studying these animals we have taken unbiased approaches, assessed known mouse age- associated phenotypes, and investigated specific pathways targeted by c-Myc. Our studies have identified  inflammation and lipid metabolism as the major targets of future investigation. Going forward we propose to investigate a large number of physiological phenotypes in the Myc-het mice, how they change with age, and which ones may explain the observed lifespan extension. The second project has revolved mostly around replicative senescence of human fibroblasts in cell culture. We performed high throughput studies of epigenetic changes during senescence, and discovered extensive genome-wide rearrangements of chromatin that culminate in the heterochromatinization of active genes and expression and activation of retrotransposable elements. Interestingly, we have also found that retrotransposable elements and satellite sequences become expressed with age in several mouse tissues. We propose to apply these approaches to study the aging epigenome in the mouse. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  First, we have found a novel genetic intervention that significantly extends lifespan in the mouse. Our data  indicate that the mechanisms responsible for this effect are likely to be quite different from those studied in  other models of longevity. Second, we have discovered that the fundamental architecture of the genome  undergoes widespread alterations during cellular senescence. These degenerative changes that profoundly  affect genome integrity are likely to be the consequence cellular aging processes."
"9601390","Epilepsy is a common disorder and approximately 30% of patients are refractory to treatments. There has been growing attention to metabolic dysfunction as a causative factor in epilepsy. Recent studies have identified mutations in the SLC13A5 gene that codes for the NaCT Na+/citrate transporter in children with early onset epileptic encephalopathy. The NaCT transporter is located on the plasma membrane and carries citrate and succinate into the cell. The effect of a loss in transport of exogenous citrate, and possibly succinate, in neurons and astrocytes and the mechanism of development of epilepsy in these patients is completely unexplored. This exploratory proposal is to define the effect of loss of NaCT expression on transport of citrate and succinate in cultured neurons and astrocytes, and to understand the metabolic and bioenergetic consequences of this loss. We hypothesize that exogenous citrate, or possibly succinate, has an important role in neuronal bioenergetics and susceptibility to excitotoxicity. In addition, citrate is the starting material for lipid/membrane and cholesterol synthesis and can act as a divalent cation chelator. The potential roles for NaCT transport will be explored in two Specific Aims: 1. To define NaCT-mediated citrate or succinate transport in cultured neurons and astrocytes. NaCT expression will be manipulated by genetic means or coexpression of epilepsy-related NaCT mutants. We will also manipulate NaCT activity with novel high affinity, high specificity pharmacological inhibitors. 2. To determine the metabolic consequence of inhibiting or overexpressing NaCT in cultured neurons and astrocytes. Cellular bioenergetics will be assessed as will the metabolic fate of exogenous citrate and succinate. This multi-PI project will merge expertise in neuronal metabolism and in NaCT transport physiology. These experiments will be the first examination of diminished NaCT transporter to neuronal or astrocyte function. Groundwork will be laid for future, more in-depth studies of the mechanisms by which citrate and/or succinate homeostasis affects neuronal excitability and the development of epilepsy. We anticipate our findings to identify potential therapeutic strategies that relate not only to epilepsies resulting from the NaCT mutations but to other medically refractory forms as well."
"9597207","Neurotransmitter release is tightly regulated to ensure stability of neural circuits and reliability of synaptic transmission. At the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), loss of postsynaptic glutamate receptor sensitivity triggers a retrograde signal that promotes presynaptic release of glutamate. Recently, our laboratory has shown that acute fasting of Drosophila larvae suppresses this retrograde signal. This nutrient dependent regulation of retrograde synaptic compensation depends on postsynaptic transcription of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein (4E-BP) to limit protein translation. This finding suggests nutrition and protein translation play significant roles in regulating the set point of synaptic function. In preliminary findings, we provide evidence to indicate this fasting response in the muscle depends on insulin signaling: phosphorylation of Akt, a target of insulin signaling, decreases with fasting in the muscle and overexpression of a constitutively active insulin receptor in the muscle protects against the inhibitory effects of fasting. We show that insulin peptide from the fat body is sufficient to suppress the muscle-derived retrograde signal to suggest signaling from fat bodies mediate the inhibitory fasting response at the NMJ. To extend our initial findings on acute fasting, we attempted to limit protein translation by exposing larvae to an amino acid deprived environment. To our surprise, we find that retrograde synaptic compensation remains intact. We hypothesize the amino acid sensor, general control non-derepressible-2 (GCN2), is activated during amino acid deprivation to maintain synaptic transmission. Indeed, we find that postsynaptic GCN2 is required to maintain baseline synaptic transmission in response to acute amino acid deprivation and this depends on phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2A (eIF2?). Both our data on the effects of acute fasting and amino acid deprivation suggest the importance of protein translation in regulating synaptic transmission. We extend our investigation to additional proteins that may regulate synaptic transmission through translational mechanisms. We previously showed that leucine-rich kinase 2 (LRRK2) is important for regulating translation initiation and retrograde synaptic compensation. However, it remains unclear how LRRK2 may regulate protein translation. Here, we show that LRRK2 mediates the addition of eIF4A into the cap-binding complex for promoting the translation of specific mRNAs to activate retrograde synaptic compensation. Based on sound scientific premise and rigorous evaluation of our findings, we have built a proposal to uncover new modes in the regulation of synaptic transmission and further enrich our understanding of the molecular control of synaptic function."
"9481329","ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity."
"9607466","Developing enhanced methods for reporting and manipulating brain activity is a major focus of the BRAIN Initiative. A major aspect of these efforts is aimed at developing genetically encoded probes for large-scale sensing and/or manipulation of neural activity in vivo. Major advances have been made in developing probes with enhanced intrinsic properties as to efficacy of reporting and/or manipulating neural activity. However, the utility of these probes in vivo has been limited by an inability to direct their localization to specific subcellular sites in brain neurons. We propose to develop a pipeline of genetically encoded localization modules or GELMs to direct probes for large-scale sensing and/or manipulation of neural activity to specific subcellular sites in brain neurons in vivo. This will yield enhanced signal to noise ratio at any specific site, and allows researchers and clinicians to more effectively report and/or modulate neuronal activity, an important step towards developing new ways to treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders. An interdisciplinary consortium comprising neurobiologists, binder developers, and neural activity probe developers assembled here proposes development of a very ambitious pipeline for development of a robust and diverse set of genetically encoded localization modules, or GELMs, that when fused to activity reporters and modulators, or ARMs, will lead to the localization and concentration of the fusion proteins at specific subcellular sites in neurons. The ability to effectively and reliably target ARMs, and other genetically encoded probes, to specific subcellular sites in brain neurons in vivo will transform the methodology for large-scale sensing and/or manipulation of neural. The novel high-throughput pipeline for GELM development is based on a convergence of powerful new methods. The first is advances in developing high affinity, specific binders for neuronal target proteins in a format that can be used as intrabodies within neurons. These will be developed into Intrabody-based GELMs or I-GELMs. The pipeline also takes advantage of emerging data on targeting motifs present in otherwise highly related proteins that exhibit highly specific yet distinct subcellular localizations in brain neurons, and that affords an opportunity to develop Targeting motif-based GELMs or T-GELMs based on these motifs. We take advantage of high throughput systems for evaluating the expression, localization and function of GELM-ARM fusions in brain neurons. Lastly, we will make GELMs and GELM-ARM fusions widely available through open source plasmid repositories."
"9471301","Global Alzheimer's Platform Trial-Ready Cohort for Preclinical/Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease (GAP TRC-PAD)  Academic PIs: Paul Aisen, Reisa Sperling, Jeff Cummings SUMMARY  Based on growing recognition that the long pre-dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) represent the optimal time for interventions aimed at modifying the neurobiology of the disease, most recent drug development programs enroll participants at the preclinical/asymptomatic and prodromal/mild cognitive impairment stages. However, the timeframe, complexity and expense of the recruitment process and site activation for these secondary prevention trials are extremely challenging, and indeed site start-up and trial enrollment, in general, represent the greatest bottleneck for drug development for AD. Thus, there is growing consensus in our field that we must fundamentally overhaul the current clinical trial recruitment and assessment process for these early intervention trials. The overarching goal of this proposal is to accelerate current and future secondary prevention trial enrollment through an innovative, highly efficient approach to identify, evaluate, and enroll appropriate preclinical and prodromal trial candidates, supported by a new site network with enhanced capacities for more efficient and effective conduct of AD clinical trials. It is our view that this can be accomplished only through a public-private partnership, the GAP Partnership, between this project and the GAP Foundation. Beginning in early 2014, the Global Alzheimer Platform (GAP) brought together academic, industry, advocacy and other Alzheimer's leaders to identify the necessary components to build large ?trial-ready cohorts? (TRC) for preclinical/prodromal AD (PAD) trials (TRC-PAD) and to support a network (GAP-Net) of pre-qualified ?trial-ready sites? with specific expertise in and uniform processes for the clinical and biomarker assessments required for prevention trials. The specific goal of the current project is to build a large TRC-PAD (n=2000; 1000 preclinical/1000 prodromal AD), to facilitate enrollment into ongoing PAD trials using the GAP-Net framework. This application describes a process of connecting existing ?feeder? registries and studies to a GAP Registry to capture demographic, genetic and longitudinal clinical and cognitive information on older, non-demented individuals interested in trials. The Registry data generates risk scores for AD pathology (initially elevated amyloid in brain, but with methods adaptable to tau pathology and other biomarkers), that allows efficient selection of candidates for in-person biomarker (initially amyloid PET scans) and clinical assessment. The results of these assessments, in turn, allow an adaptive statistical algorithm to improve the selection process moving forward. Individuals with PET scans showing amyloid accumulation in brain (or alternative biomarker confirmation) are invited to join the GAP Cohort, with semi-annual in-person follow-up within the GAP-Net network of pre-qualified clinical sites, from which they can be invited to enroll in early stage trials. Overall, the process will dramatically shorten the timeline for preclinical/prodromal trials, and will address a series of scientific hypotheses to guide further development in the field."
"9520713","Project Summary: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with about 8500 cases diagnosed each year in the United States. Within a time frame of 15 month virtually all patients succumb to this detrimental disease despite treatment efforts. Therefore, novel, ideally tumor specific approaches are necessary to combat these tumors. While single reagents may efficiently target other tumors, such as hematological malignancies, Glioblastoma is strikingly different since it is a tumor that is characterized by extensive heterogeneity, demanding the simultaneous inhibition of ideally several deregulated pathways. Our previous research has shown that targeting tumor mitochondria for cancer therapy causes significant anti-glioma effects, especially when used in combination therapies. In this proposal, an accomplished team of investigators will be characterizing a novel treatment concept for glioblastoma by causing tumor-cell specific cell death through induction of synthetic lethality in IDH1 mutated GBMs. In the first aim, we will dissect the most proximal effect of mutant IDH1 and 2-HG, involving tumor cell metabolism that finally renders tumors susceptible to Bcl-xL inhibition mediated apoptosis. In the second aim, we will test as to whether interference with anti- apoptotic Bcl-2 family members along with 2-HG results in an integrated stress response with an Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) mediated increase of Noxa, which in turn antagonizes Mcl-1 and primes tumor cells to apoptosis. In the third aim, we will assess as to whether the IDH1 mutations are synthetically lethal with tumor mitochondria targeting drugs and extend animal survival in disease-relevant animal models of glioma. Overall, our research may help to provide more specific and efficient treatments for patients suffering from GBM. Overall, this research may enhance our understanding about the treatment of brain tumors and may potentially allow us to formulate a novel treatment strategy for secondary glioblastoma and other gliomas."
"9536168","Project Summary/Abstract  Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the United States. More adults are affected by stroke each year than Alzheimer?s disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Parkinson?s disease. Hemorrhagic strokes represent the most severe subtypes of stroke. An estimated 40- 50% of hemorrhagic stroke victims will die and more than 80% of survivors remain disabled after hemorrhagic stroke. Yet the vast majority of analyses on outcome after stroke have focused principally on gross measures of functional outcome.  Furthermore, hemorrhagic stroke differs from ischemic stroke where a loss of blood causes the area affected to be readily visible on scanning. But with hemorrhagic stroke, not only the area that we can directly see, but nearby tracts that have been compressed or stretched by the mass of the hemorrhage can be injured.  We propose to follow-up on 500 cases of deep and lobar ICH to perform serial evaluations of motor and cognitive function and advanced neuroimaging to determine predictors of recovery, progressive cognitive or functional impairment. Our proposal has the advantages of adding onto a prospective ICH study which will identify and recruit cases, ability to evaluate for the degree and impact of survival and severity biases, baseline neuroimaging which includes baseline MRI, biologic samples including genotyping for apolipoprotein E alleles and uniform phenotype definitions as well as expertise in recovery/outcome analyses, advanced neuroimaging processes and epidemiologic study."
"9485819","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Methionine sulfoxide reductases (MsrA and MsrB) are repair enzymes that reduce methionine sulfoxide (MetO) residues in proteins to methionine (Met) in a stereospecific manner. These enzymes protect cells from oxidative stress and have been implicated in delaying the aging process and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Mammals possess one MsrA and three MsrBs. The major mammalian MsrB, MsrB1, is a selenocysteine-containing protein, whose expression and activity can be regulated by dietary selenium. In this application, we propose to characterize regulation of protein function by stereospecific, site-specific, reversible Met oxidation; define the roles of Met, MetO and enzymes that act upon them in the regulation of lifespan; and establish a systems-level understanding of Met oxidation. Specific Aim 1 is based on the finding that mouse Mical proteins specifically oxidize conserved Met residues in actin, which are then reduced back to Met by MsrB1. Further studies may add MetO to a list of posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation that regulate protein function. We will characterize Mical-based oxidation of Met residues in actin and MsrB-based reduction of MetO residues, determine the redox state of Met in actin using unique reagents and examine physiological relevance of actin regulation through reversible Met oxidation. Specific Aim 2 will address discrepancy in the regulation of lifespan by various Msrs. We will use transgenic fruit flies expressing various Msrs to test the hypothesis that the reduction of free MetO contributes to lifespan control by these enzymes. In addition, we will employ Met and MetO diets to test the hypothesis that the regulation of lifespan by Met depends on the status of other amino acids. Specific Aim 3 will identify proteins with MetO by using advanced proteomic methods and characterize Met reactivity on the proteome scale. We will also employ stereospecific MetO sensors to characterize these species in cells and biological samples."
"9453689","PROJECT SUMMARY One of the most impressive feats the brain performs is its use of information that is rife with uncertainty to successfully guide behavior. That the world is full of ambiguous stimuli and perceived through noisy sensors is clear. However, whether and how the brain makes use of this uncertainty is an open and important question. Behavioral studies using tasks with noisy or ambiguous stimuli suggest that subjects' performance is nearly optimal. These results strongly suggest that the brain must represent and use information about sensory uncertainty itself in addition to information about parameters of the stimulus, yet many theories about neural coding do not account for how such uncertainty could be represented or used. The theory of Probabilistic Population Coding (PPC) does provide such an account, claiming that populations of neurons encode estimates of stimulus parameters and uncertainty regarding those estimates simultaneously in the form of a ?likelihood function? over the stimulus. PPCs further provide neurally plausible mechanisms for performing a number of Bayesian computations, however, this promising theory has never been tested neurophysiologically at the population level.  To study the mechanisms by which the brain represents and uses sensory uncertainty to guide adaptive behavior, the current proposal will combine multi-electrode recordings, computational neuroscience and psychophysics. Specifically, we will study visual decision-making in an orientation classification task, which we have previously shown that primates perform near optimally and which requires the use of uncertainty information to achieve optimal performance. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that populations of neurons jointly encode likelihood functions as predicted by PPC, by recording from V1 while subjects perform the classification task. In Aim 2, we will test whether a shared encoding of uncertainty information between V1 and prefrontal cortex (PFC) leads to a functional correlation between these two areas. Through our combination of in vivo population recordings in awake, behaving primates, the proposed project is strongly positioned to test the core hypothesis behind PPC and elucidate the mechanisms by which the brain makes possible optimal behavioral performance in a noisy environment."
"9584971","PROJECT SUMMARY Human rhinovirus (RV) is the major pathogen of common cold, asthma, and asthma exacerbation. Airway epithelial cells have been the focus for RV research as it is believed to be the primary site for infection and replication. On the other hand, inflammatory cells including monocytes and macrophages are abundant in diseased airways. Although both epithelial cells and monocytes/macrophages play important roles in RV- induced pathogenesis, their interactions are rarely studied. It is a long-held belief that RV can enter monocytes/macrophages and induce proinflammatory cytokine expression in the absence of viral replication. In our recent publication, we demonstrated for the first time that a major-group RV entered, replicated and induced significant cytokine production in monocytic cell line (THP-1) in the presence of airway epithelial cells or their conditioned media (CM). In our preliminary data, we further showed that primary macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were also able to support RV replication in the presence of CM. These data suggest a significant role of epithelial cells in regulating permissiveness of monocytes/macrophages for RV infection. Interestingly, the only two previously documented events of monocytic RV replication occurred in THP-1 that was differentiated to macrophage by a PMA protocol, but they failed in finding any underlying mechanism. In our study, increased ICAM1 was found to be both necessary and sufficient to drive RV16 replication in THP-1 treated by CM or by the same PMA protocol, suggesting the involvement of a shared pathway between the two treatments. But, our CM model is obviously more physiologically relevant than the PMA model. To identify the potential epithelial factor(s) that drive this change, we performed size fractionation, in-solution digestion, liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. 4 protein candidates were discovered. Thus, protein(s) in CM likely drive the change of permissiveness of monocytic cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that epithelial factor(s) renders monocytes/macrophages permissive for RV replication via an ICAM1 mediated mechanism, thereby exacerbating inflammation and potentially leading to RV-associated airway illnesses. We will address this hypothesis in two aims. Specific Aim1 will determine the molecular basis of induced permissiveness of monocytes/macrophages for RV infection by testing two related working hypotheses: 1) increased ICAM1 enhances viral entry and cellular viral burden, thereby circumventing antiviral defense; and/or 2) increased ICAM1 weakens cellular antiviral defense. Specific Aim2 will identify and characterize soluble factor(s) in airway epithelium CM that induces the change of permissiveness for RV infection. The success of this project will have significant impact on the development of therapeutics for treating RV-induced airway illnesses by elucidating novel targets (i.e. permissiveness-inducing factor and replicating-RV-bearing monocytes/macrophages)."

SUMO1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier-1) is a small regulatory protein that is linked to substrate proteins through enzymatic reactions. SUMO1 conjugation of its substrate proteins controls the cellular function of substrate proteins. In our recent work, we have revealed that SUMO1 conjugation pathway is overactive in glioblastoma and drives the cancer progression. To target this pathway, we have developed glioblastoma cell-based SUMO1 assays for drug screening and identified the SMIC1 from the NCI drugable compound library. In the efforts of preclinical development of SMIC1 as an anticancer drug, we have followed the FDA guidance for nonclinical evaluation of new anticancer agents and tested the toxicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) of SMIC1 and demonstrated that SMIC1 has an acceptable safety margin and drugable PK features in animals. In systemic administration, SMIC1 can be quickly delivered to brains through the blood brain barrier (BBB) and effectively inhibits glioblastoma xenograft growth. In search of target proteins, we have shown that cyclin-dependent kinase-6 (CDK6) is a substrate of both SUMO1 and ubiquitin (UB). SUMO1-CDK6 conjugation blocks CDK6 ubiquitination and the UB-mediated degradation and thus stabilizes CDK6 kinase for driving cell growth through phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein-1 (RB1); thus, SMIC1 treatment blocks SUMO1-CDK6 conjugation and eliminates CDK6-RB1 pathway. On the other hand, CDK4/6 inhibitors have been developed targeting CDK4/6-RB1 pathway and they are now in clinic for cancer therapies. RB1 deletion and mutation occurs in about 11% glioblastomas and results in the cancer resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. In contrast, we have shown that SMIC1 can overcome the resistance through inhibition of various SUMO1 substrate proteins. The objective of this proposal is to develop SMIC1 as a new anticancer drug for treatment of glioblastomas. To achieve this, we will first determine the molecular mechanisms of action of SMIC1 in treatment of glioblastoma cells. In particular, we will examine how SMIC1 treatment induces the ubiquitination and degradation of SUMO1 protein and abolishes SUMO1 conjugation pathway in human glioblastoma cells. Next, we will examine the bioactivity and pharmacodynamics of SMIC1 in comparison with CDK4/6 inhibitors in genetically heterogenous glioblastoma cells and thus determine why SMIC1 treatment can overcome the resistance of RB1 deletion and mutation. Finally, we will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of SMIC1 using the cancer stem cell cultures and xenograft models generated from patients' glioblastoma tissues. Upon completion, this project will lead to the genesis of a new class anticancer drug for clinical treatment of glioblastoma patients."
"9484210","?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of the aging brain in a well characterized community-based longitudinal prospective cohort study. The Adult Changes of Thought (ACT) study enrolled a cohort of 2,581 Group Health participants in 1994-1996, an expansion cohort of 811 in 2000-2002, and in 2005 began continuous enrollment to keep 2,000 people alive and at risk for dementia outcomes; total enrollment to date is nearly 5,000. Extensive and unmatched clinical and research study data are available for study participants. Autopsy consent is sought; 560 autopsies have been completed to date, and more than a third of active participants have signed autopsy consents. Investigators propose three aims. Aim 1 addresses MULTIMORBIDITY: the single and joint effects of blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol, and their treatments, on the aging brain. Outcomes include time to dementia and Alzheimer's disease, cognitive functioning, standard neuropathological indices, and newly developed quantitative measures of regional Aß, tau, and synaptophysin. This aim leverages important methodological innovations, including hierarchical Bayesian modeling of exposure trajectories to incorporate sporadically collected clinical data, modern psychometric approaches to cognitive data, use of marginal structural models to account for selection bias for autopsy studies, new criteria for neuropathological assessment of AD, and the newly developed quantitative measures of neuropathology. Aim 2 addresses RESILIENCE: why some people do well despite factors associated with doing poorly. Aim 2a addresses the role of physical activity on trajectories of cognition and physical performance, using accelerometers to address the amount and type of activity associated with protection. Aim 2b addresses factors associated with living to age 85 while preserving cognition and mobility, specifically focusing on physical activity and on medical comorbidity. Aim 2c addresses factors associated with avoiding dementia despite accumulation of neuropathology. In particular, Aim 2c will focus on synaptic contents, applying flow cytometry of a synaptosome preparation. Aim 3 addresses a LIVING LABORATORY: continuing to serve as a resource to researchers around the world."
"9446684","PROJECT SUMMARY Cholestasis is a common manifestation of liver disease. Cholestasis often is due to disorders specifically affecting cholangiocytes, which play a major role in bile secretion. They are responsible for secretion of bicarbonate into bile and modulating the biliary contents of other constituents as well. The type III inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R-3) is the primary intracellular calcium release channel in cholangiocytes and our previous studies have shown that apically-localized InsP3R-3 controls bicarbonate secretion. We also found that in most ductular forms of human cholestasis and in multiple animal models, there is loss of InsP3R-3 expression, underlying the importance of calcium homeostasis in normal cholangiocyte function and its dysregulation in cholestasis. We hypothesize that restoration of InsP3R-3 expression will ameliorate cholestasis and improve biliary bicarbonate secretion. Thus the long term objective of this grant is to understand the molecular mechanisms of InsP3R-3 regulation in normal and cholestatic liver and the therapeutic effect of restoration of InsP3R- 3 expression on liver function. To achieve this objective, the proposal will be implemented with the following specific aims: (1) The molecular factors governing the regulation of InsP3R-3 gene expression will be defined by studying the transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRs) that regulate the InsP3R-3 promoter and mRNA respectively; (2) The cellular mechanisms that direct InsP3R-3 to the subapical region of cholangiocytes including targeting sequences and interacting proteins that lead to such localization will be established; (3) Molecular mechanisms that lead to loss of InsP3R-3 expression and function in animal/human models of cholestasis (including InsP3R-3 KO mice and CRISPR/Cas9-InsP3R-3-null human cholangiocytes) will be determined and verified in human cholestatic liver. Further, we will investigate whether restoration of expression-specific TFs/miRs-anti-miRs in cholestasis results in improvement of disease. Together, the data derived from these studies will improve our understanding of the regulation of secretion in cholangiocytes, and have the potential to lead to design of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cholestatic disorders."
"9451926","Skeletal muscle weakness is a known contributor to morbidity and mortality in aging and other diseases; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been well defined. It has recently been shown that disruption of circadian rhythms leads to significant weakness. Preliminary data from our lab shows that mice in which Bmal1, a core circadian gene, has been inducibly knocked-out in adult skeletal muscle (iMSBmal1-/-) express an increased amount of a longer spliceform of titin protein than their vehicle-treated counterparts (iMSBmal1+/+). These muscles also display increased variability in sarcomere length, decreases in specific tension, as well as diminished unstimulated baseline tension, a preliminary measure of passive tension. These data lead to my hypothesis that loss of Bmal1 expression in adult skeletal muscle will lead to 1) the increased inclusion of PEVK exons in titin that will contribute to sarcomere length variability and 2) changes in titin spliceform and sarcomere length will be associated with deficits in both the isometric length-tension relationship and elastic properties of this muscle. I will test my novel hypothesis through two aims. Specific Aim 1 will define the splicing changes in titin of iMSBmal1-/- skeletal muscle. RNA-Seq will be used to determine exon inclusion/exclusion in titin of iMSBmal1-/- and iMSBmal1+/+ tibialis anterior muscle. I will also test if changes to the length of the PEVK domain in titin protein account for the increased sarcomere length variability in iMSBmal1-/- skeletal muscle using immunohistochemical techniques combined with deconvoluted confocal microscopy. This aim will define the changes to a key sarcomeric protein, titin, following muscle-specific Bmal1 knockout and links this change to maintaining sarcomere length homogeneity. Specific Aim 2 tests if properties of titin-based skeletal muscle active and passive tension are diminished following Bmal1 knockout. I will perform in situ mechanical experiments to test both the isometric length-tension relationship of the muscle as well as the elasticity of the TA muscle without contractile contributions. I will then relate these measurements to the titin spliceform expressed within the muscle as well as immunohistochemical measurements (i.e., fiber cross-sectional area and fibrosis). These experiments will help determine the effects a loss of Bmal1 in skeletal muscle has on altered titin expression and sarcomere length maintenance with implications for the active length-tension relationship. The findings from this project hold potential to provide insight into a novel finding that the molecular clock helps to maintain skeletal muscle's structure and basic functional properties of the muscle through its control of titin spliceform expression."

"9465070","The goal of this Phase I STTR project is to construct, optimize, and test a clinically viable intravascular near-infrared fluorescence/intravascular ultrasound (NIRF-IVUS) imaging catheter for simultaneous molecular and structural diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is a worldwide leading cause of death and disability, including acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Molecular processes such as inflammation drive devastating CAD and stent complications, but are largely invisible to contemporary clinical imaging methods. The ability to image and quantify molecular processes will greatly improve our ability to improve CAD patient risk stratification, improve percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures at the point of care, optimally tailor CAD and stent pharmacotherapies (including PCSK9 inhibitors), and streamline new CAD and coronary stent product development. Intravascular Imaging Inc. (i3) in collaboration with MGH has developed novel and innovative intravascular imaging systems that combine high-resolution IVUS, the current anatomical imaging standard of care, with NIRF molecular imaging, a powerful new molecular imaging approach. However, our prototype intracoronary NIRF-IVUS catheter is too large (4.5 French/1.5 mm) for routine clinical coronary imaging. In order to enable clinical translational and commercialization of intracoronary NIRF imaging, this Phase I STTR objective is design, construct, and miniaturize a NIRF-IVUS imaging catheter for imaging smaller coronary arteries and to test it in vivo. In Aim 1, i3 will engineer miniaturized NIRF-IVUS catheters for use in coronary arteries (<3.6French/1.2 mm diameter). In Aim 2, MGH will test the NIRF-IVUS catheters in swine coronary arteries to obtain simultaneous in vivo coronary molecular-structural imaging of plaque inflammation and plaque burden. The anticipated results of this proposal will generate a highly translatable, coronary artery NIRF-IVUS imaging catheter that can simultaneously image plaque inflammation based on NIRF molecular contrast, and plaque structure based on IVUS. Following successful completion of this project, i3 will submit an SBIR/STTR Phase II application to construct GMP grade intracoronary NIRF-IVUS coronary artery imaging catheters and systems, with the goal of obtaining FDA IDE approval for first-in-human studies. The long-term objective of intracoronary NIRF-IVUS is to improve the outcome of CAD patients entering the cardiac catheterization laboratory by: A) Better risk-stratifying patients at risk of coronary plaque or stent complications; B) Identifying the higher-risk CAD patients likely to benefit from PCSK9 inhibitor therapy; and C) Comprehensively assessing the molecular and structural efficacy of novel CAD pharmacotherapeutics and new stents in Phase IIa/IIb and Phase III clinical trials."
"9470891","PROJECT SUMMARY: MODELING PROJECT Our overall aim is to develop, apply, and distribute computational tools that predict the activities for individual enzymes and for multiple enzymes that function together in a biochemical pathway. We integrate concepts and methods derived from comparative protein structure modeling, structure-based ligand docking, integrative structural biology, chemoinformatics, and systems biology. Specific Aim 1. A major focus has been the development and application of structure-based approaches to predict substrates for enzymes of unknown function; when experimental structures are unavailable, we have demonstrated that comparative protein models can be productively used. While we have had substantial success, key challenges remain to enable routine, successful application, including: sampling both covalent and non-covalent intermediates, expanding from simple substrate prediction to predicting activities across a metabolic pathway, and an elementary lack of the right metabolites in our docking libraries. 1a. We will explore a new covalent-docking method to allow sampling both non-covalent intermediates as may be suitable for many enzyme families. 1b. We will broaden our efforts from docking potential substrates against a single target, to doing so against candidate members of an entire pathway; this will be key information to integrative modeling of metabolic pathways. 1c. To address the problem of missing metabolites, we will use chemoinformatics to infer metabolites from the docking of synthetic libraries, which span a much larger chemical space, and have fewer gaps, than the extant metabolite libraries. Specific Aim 2. We aim to develop, apply, and distribute a method for mapping metabolic pathways that will identify the enzymes and ligands in a pathway as well as their order. The goal will be achieved by integrating structural and systems information, such as data from virtual screening, cheminformatics, genomic context, ligand binding experiments, and metabolomics. Specific Aim 3. The Metabolism Project (supported by the Protein Core) will test predictions of metabolite docking on individual enzymes, and predictions of integrative mapping for metabolic pathways, providing crucial feedback to evaluate and improve the methods. The Ligand Discovery Project will provide data for integrative mapping, and structure determination efforts will facilitate comparative protein modeling and, in select cases, test predictions of protein-ligand complex structures generated by metabolite docking. Specific Aim 4. We will make our tools widely used, including, when possible, by non-expert scientists. Thus, we will automate and distribute our open source packages, web servers, databases, benchmarks, and sample applications. These will include optimized libraries of metabolites in dockable forms and an optimized tool for docking these metabolites, a tool for covalent docking, tools within the ZINC family of programs and databases to seek metabolites that resemble synthetic molecules, and to optimize specific libraries, and well as the open source IMP package for integrative pathway."
"9675660","ABSTRACT   It has now been clearly established in both animal models and in humans that inhalation of asbestos fibers  can lead to neoplastic diseases such as malignant mesothelioma (MM) and lung cancer. This is an important  ongoing problem, since asbestos is still in used in many countries around the world and there is also a large  pool of previously exposed individuals who are at risk for cancer. There is currently no effective screening or  chemopreventive approach for these at-risk populations. Given that recent studies have indicated that the  pathogenesis of asbestos-induced cancers is due to chronic inflammation and oxidative tissue damage caused  by persistent asbestos fibers, a well-tolerated and safe agent with anti-inflammatory AND anti-oxidant  properties could thus potentially be used to prevent the development of MM in asbestos exposed populations.   Based on preliminary findings, we have found that flaxseed lignans are safe, non-toxic compounds that  have potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. We therefore hypothesize that that flaxseed or  enriched flaxseed lignans could function as safe, non-toxic chemopreventive agents in asbestos-  induced mesothelioma. The goal of this grant is to provide data needed as the first steps to test and  validate this hypothesis. To achieve our goal, we propose to: 1) Evaluate the ability of the active lignan in  flaxseed, Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), to interfere with asbestos-induced ROS generation,  inflammasome activation, and reactive oxygen species generation in macrophages and mesothelial cells in  vitro. 2) Evaluate the ability of wholegrain flaxseed or flaxseed-lignan complex given in diets to prevent acute  asbestos-induced inflammation and oxidative damage in the mesothelial SV40 T-Antigen and the  Nf2+/mut;Cdkn2a+/mut asbestos-induced malignant mesothelioma mouse models, and 3) Evaluate the ability of  wholegrain flaxseed or flaxseed-derived lignan SDG given in diets to prevent asbestos-induced MM formation  and death in these same mouse models. If our studies show efficacy with safety, the natural extension of our  work would be a toxicity and biomarker trial in which patients with heavy asbestos exposure who also had  biomarkers of exposure (identified above and in Project 6) would be given flaxseed or the lignan formulation  and changes in biomarkers identified. If we observed clear changes in this trial, a larger chemoprevention trial  in high risk populations could be considered. We will interact with closely with three projects in this Superfund  Proposal including testing remediated asbestos from Project 1, working closely with the animal model studies  in Project 4, and taking advantage of the biomarker work in Project 6. We will also interact significantly with  the Administration and Biostatistics Cores of the SF proposal and the Biomarker Core of the CEET."

"9660210","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is a debilitating neurological disorder that is associated with tremendous socioeconomic burden. Whereas FDA-approved tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a potent thrombolytic agent for treating acute ischemic stroke, few patients present for treatment within its therapeutic window. There remains substantial interest in developing strategies to extend the thrombolytic therapy into subpopulations who may benefit from late intervention. MRI has become an essential clinical tool for the triage and management of acute ischemic stroke patients, yet the conventional stroke MRI is inadequate to fully characterize the heterogeneous ischemic tissue injury and effectively guide treatment in late presenting stroke patients. The approximation of diffusion/perfusion MRI (DWI/PWI) mismatch as ischemic penumbra, despite its initial enthusiasm, has been recognized to be oversimplified. PWI lesion contains tissue at no risk to infarction, while DWI lesion may recover if promptly reperfused. Besides falsely characterizing some salvageable tissue as ischemic core, DWI may also fail to identify tissue that has already suffered irreversible injury, as the eventual infarction is often larger than acute DWI lesion. As noted in the report of NIH/NINDS Stroke Progress Review Group (SPRG) in 2011, the number one priority for stroke imaging is to understand the impact of hemodynamics, collateral flow, oxygen and brain metabolism upon tissue survival and function. Tissue acidosis is closely associated with tissue oxygen/glucose metabolism, and may provide a metabolic biomarker for defining ischemic penumbra. However, currently available in vivo pH measurement techniques have significant limitations. Our proposal aims to develop endogenous amide proton chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI for fast and non-invasive pH imaging. We will first develop novel acquisition and post-processing strategies to enhance the sensitivity of CEST imaging (Aim1). We will develop quantitative analysis that transform pH-weighted MRI to absolute tissue pH mapping in experimental stroke model, and test it under varied glycemic conditions and stroke onset time (Aim 2). We will then evaluate pH imaging, a novel metabolic imaging marker, to guide tPA thrombolysis in an embolic stroke model that mimics tPA thrombolysis in patients (Aim 3). In summary, our proposal establishes fast and quantitative pH stroke imaging in experimental stroke models, and once the sensitivity and specificity of pH MRI in defining metabolic penumbra are confirmed, we will translate it to clinic and evaluate its utility in late-presenting stroke patients."
"9520424","Project Summary/Abstract  Gene expression is extensively controlled at the level of transcription initiation by processes that orchestrate assembly of the multi-subunit RNA polymerase II (Pol II) preinitiation complex (PIC) at promoters. Prevailing models derived from in vitro observations posit a defined pathway for assembly of the PIC and formation of stable promoter-bound complexes that facilitate transcription reinitiation and perpetuate the activated state. However, pathways for PIC assembly in vivo are not well understood, and emerging evidence suggests much more dynamic interactions between PIC components and promoters than have been observed in vitro. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed project are to elucidate pathways and mechanisms responsible for assembly and activity of PICs in vivo. To address this goal, in this proposal we will apply novel methods that we developed in the prior period for measuring chromatin-binding dynamics in budding yeast cells. Our multi-disciplinary approaches provide quantitative estimates of transcription factor (TF) binding kinetics to single-copy loci including on- and off-rates as well as fractional occupancies of a DNA site by a TF in a cell population. In Aim 1, we will measure both chromatin binding dynamics of critical transcriptional components and RNA synthesis dynamics at a model activated gene, and mutational analyses will be used to determine the relationships between them. In Aim 2, we will measure chromatin-binding dynamics of key components of the PIC, genome-wide, and determine the relationships between kinetic behavior and gene regulatory properties, RNA synthesis rates, chromatin environment, and other properties. This landscape of kinetic properties will reveal the in vivo scope and scale of PIC assembly processes as they unfold in cells. Our prior work indicates that the dynamic properties of a PIC component called the TATA-binding protein (TBP) are controlled by an essential ATPase called Mot1. In Aim 3, we will use combined approaches to test specific models for Mot1's function in gene activation, and in so doing shed light on how regulation of chromatin binding dynamics can impact gene expression on a global scale.  There is widespread allelic variation in TF binding sites, and such variation, as well as alterations in TF expression levels, can lead to differences in chromatin occupancy that contribute to numerous and prevalent human diseases, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, mental illnesses, and cancer. TFs themselves have been largely refractory to pharmacologic intervention; instead, we propose that a quantitative understanding of TF binding and PIC assembly dynamics in vivo will identify kinetic bottlenecks that will provide a foundation for ultimately developing entirely new approaches to treat transcriptional defects in human development and disease."

"9447174","PROJECT SUMMARY The obesity pandemic is accelerating the risk of diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardio- vascular diseases and other ailments. PPARa agonist drugs are prescribed to promote fat loss and amelio- rate hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance by activating gene programs driving mitochondrial b-oxidation. Effects of PPARa agonists in the liver are enhanced by remodeling the action of MAMs, cytoplasmic struc- tures that foster exchange of Ca2+ and phospholipids between the mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticu- lum. The master mTORC2/Akt signaling node localizes to the MAM where it coordinates PPARa and MAM actions through an unknown mechanism. Therefore, understanding how mTORC2/Akt regulates PPARa and MAMs in the liver is crucial to developing new approaches to combat the obesity epidemic. Our long- term goal is to understand how nuclear gene expression and cytoplasmic ER/mitochondrial activity are coor- dinated to control energy homeostasis in humans. The objective of this particular application is to determine how mTORC2/Akt-mediated phosphorylation of the multi-functional protein PACS-2 Ser437 combines with PACS-2 nuclear trafficking signals to coordinate PPARa transcriptional activity with MAM-dependent calci- um exchange in response to fasting or a high fat diet. Our central hypothesis is that in response to overeat- ing, mTORC2/Akt-phosphorylated PACS-2 sequesters PPARa in the cytoplasm and increases MAMs, there- by repressing genes controlling fatty acid oxidation while inducing calcium overload in mitochondria. These combined effects cause steatosis and insulin resistance. By contrast, fasting silences mTORC2/Akt signal- ing, triggering PACS-2 dephosphorylation. Consequently, PPARa is liberated and MAMs are remodeled, which combine to increase fatty acid oxidation and support fasting-induced autophagy. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will test our hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine how liver PACS- 2 coordinates PPARa-dependent gene expression with MAM remodeling to regulate fatty acid oxidation; 2) Determine how mTOR/Akt controls PACS-2 regulation of PGC-1a/PPARa activity; and 3) Determine how PACS-2 regulates access of PPARa to the nucleus. The approach is innovative because it will combine in vivo models of overnutrition and fasting together with studies on gene expression, ER-mitochondria commu- nication, mitochondrial oxygen consumption and live-cell imaging to describe a novel and previously unrec- ognized pathway controlling the response to fasting or a high fat diet. This research is significant because it will advance our understanding of how mTORC2/Akt controls PACS-2 Ser437 to act as a molecular switch to coordinate vital, homeostatic transcriptional and mitochondrial responses to nutrient stresses."
"9690391","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma is a major form of skin cancer and arises from the malignant transformation of melanocytes. One of the most commonly mutated genes in melanoma is B-RAF (~50%), which encodes a member of the RAF protein kinase family and an intermediate in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade. Findings from recent clinical trials using B-RAF inhibitors in malignant melanoma have shown great promise for B-RAF-targeted therapy. However, the clinical findings also revealed development of resistance to B-RAF inhibitor as a major therapeutic challenge. We have recently discovered a novel bi-directional crosstalk between B-RAF and the tumor suppressor LKB1-AMPK pathway, another important signaling pathway involved in the regulation of cancer cell growth, proliferation and survival. Activators of the LKB1-AMPK pathway (such as metformin, a common anti-diabetes drug, and its analog phenformin) have recently shown anti-tumor activities in cell culture studies and mouse models. Based on our recent findings, we hypothesize that combination treatment of B- RAF inhibitors and AMPK activators will offer therapeutic advantages for the treatment of melanoma over the B-RAF inhibitor single agent therapy, and holds the potential for overcoming drug resistance to B-RAF inhibitors. The goal of this proposal is to define the biochemical mechanism underlying the attenuation of BRAF-MEK-ERK signaling by AMPK and to assess pre-clinically the therapeutic benefit of combining AMPK activators with B-RAF inhibitors for melanoma treatment. In aim 1, we will further elucidate the biochemical mechanism underlying the regulation of ERK signaling by AMPK and study its role in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival in response to energy stress. In aim 2, we will evaluate the combinatory effect of AMPK activators and B-RAF inhibitors on inhibiting tumor growth in xenografts of human melanoma cell lines and in a B-RAF-driven genetically engineered mouse model. Finally, in aim 3, we will investigate the role of the LKB1-AMPK signaling in defining both acquired and intrinsic resistance to B-RAF inhibitors in melanoma therapy and assess the potential of AMPK activators on delaying the emergence of resistance to B-RAF inhibitors."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Results from the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention (PTP) and the type 1 diabetes (T1D) prevention trials indicate potential for success in decreasing the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in individuals destined to develop T1D. The ultimate goal is preservation of sufficient beta cell mass to prevent overt T1D. To accomplish that long-term goal, there is a critical need to identify enough individuals at risk for T1D and to remove both time- and travel-related barriers to participation in T1D prevention trials. The specific objective in this application is to create a Clinical Center and Affiliate Network that wil expand the reach of TrialNet to an under-represented region that is within 4-5 hours of Kansas City, MO. In collaboration with other Clinical Centers and Affiliates, we will help improve identification of subjects at risk for T1D at a rate sufficient to fulfill the enrollment requiremets of current and future trials designed to preserve beta cell mass in subjects at risk for development of T1D, and provide easy access to prevention trials for all subjects at risk in our region. We have commitments for new and existing Affiliates that will target about 3370 families of pediatric patients with existing T1D and almost 470 families/yr of pediatric patients with new onset T1D within a 3 hr radius of Kansas City. In that same region, we have commitments for new Affiliates that will target about 4300 families of adults with existing T1D and 440 families/yr of adults with new onset T1D. To improve the effectiveness of screening and retention, we will deploy a comprehensive business model that has been previously validated to maximize the performance of clinical trials for therapies in other disease states and will apply a novel real-tie informatics-driven system (StudyHawk) to identify qualified candidates for participation in PTP. To improve the efficiency of screening, we will leverage real-time event processing (StudyHawk) to maximize recruitment per hour spent recruiting and will apply Quality Improvement methods to identify and respond to poor performing sites. The ultimate outcome of a Clinical Center in Kansas City will be expanded access to TrialNet and prevention trials in an underserved region, a Midwest network of Clinical Centers, and increased identification of subjects at risk, increased participation in clinical trials, through development of new approaches to increase productivity that will be shared with all of TrialNet."
"9541015","Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of this work is to understand the virulence and heat shock responses by which bacteria survive environmental changes. Bacteria respond rapidly to changes by regulating gene expression through an active and complex transcriptome. Bacterial genes are often regulated by temperature-induced changes in RNA structure, which are termed `RNA thermometers' (RNATs). RNATs often function by forming a structure that sequesters the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, thereby preventing ribosome binding. Discovery and verification of RNATs has historically been conducted by computational methods and in vitro studies. A gap in knowledge exists for understanding RNAT folding in vivo, and the dynamic ability of these structures to control gene expression. To fill this gap, global genome-wide in vivo structure probing will be applied using a method recently developed in this laboratory called Structure-seq2. This technique will be used to probe the transcriptome of Bacillus subtilis, a model Gram-positive bacterial species. While pioneering work led to the description of the first RNATs, using in vivo genome-wide techniques the proposed work will identify RNATs throughout the transcriptome, not just those near SD sequences. Using Structure-seq2 the following Aims will be accomlished: (1) Probe the structural landscape of the B. subtilis transcriptome at low and high temperatures to discover RNA thermometers. RNA structure is known to change in response to temperature. This phenomenon will be explored in the B. subtilis transcriptome. As B. subtilis is a soil bacterium, high and low temperatures will be used to replicate the extremes of natural growth in the environment. Testing will begin at low and high temperatures of 23°C and 44°C to identify RNA structures that change under these different conditions. This work is supported by preliminary data. (2) Classify diverse bacterial RNA thermometers genome-wide at a series of temperatures. No RNA thermometers have been experimentally characterized from B. subtilis, although many are predicted throughout the genome. By conducting Structure-seq2 at a series of growth temperatures, RNATs will be discovered that have different melting temperatures, function at narrow and wide temperature ranges, and have an instantaneous or gradual response. Results from Aim 1 will be used as a guide for regions likely to contain RNATs. (3) Characterize B. subtilis RNAT function. RNA structures that change in response to changing temperature will be tested as thermometers using bgaB reporter assays. Regions of interest will be cloned as bgaB translational fusions to report on gene expression, and transcriptional fusions will be used for in vitro transcription attenuation assays. This work will result in the first classification of RNATs by temperature midpoints and sensitivity, and will reveal novel regulatory strategies that will be identified in other bacterial species, including human pathogens."
"9505998","SUMMARY: Multiphoton Imaging Core The goal of the Multiphoton Imaging Core (MPI Core) is to provide NINDS-supported Primary Center Investigators, and other neuroscientists at JHU who perform research consistent with the mission of NINDS, access to advanced imaging technology and training to further their ongoing research programs. In particular, the MPI Core will help investigators analyze protein localization, protein dynamics, and protein-protein interactions with high temporal and spatial resolution in situ and in vivo; perform in vivo time-lapse imaging of multiple fluorophores to monitor cell dynamics; combine imaging of ion indicator dyes/proteins with physiological monitoring of electrical activity to assess cellular communication; obtain quantitative information about neuronal morphologies in situ in health and disease to define cell identity and cellular networks; and enable neuronal and glial activity to be monitored in freely moving rodents. This Center grant will provide funds necessary to support two full-time technicians who will manage day-to-day Core activities, provide training and assist in data collection and analysis. It will also support service contracts to maintain Core equipment, and funds to purchase supplies and additional microscope components (e.g. objectives, stages) to adapt existing instrumentation to the needs of its users. In the next funding period, we will substantially expand the capabilities of the MPI Core, by providing access to fiber optic imaging platforms that enable fluorescence imaging in awake, freely moving rodents, by adapting the custom two photon microscope for resonant scanning to enable rapid collection of 3D datasets and reduce motion artifacts, and by establishing a brain clearing and light sheet imaging service to define cell distribution and morphology in the intact CNS. These additional capabilities will allow Core users access to the most recent technology for observing cell structure and cellular activity to determine how these features influence normal behavior and neurological disease. The unique capabilities of the MPI Core will continue to serve as a crucial resource for NINDS-funded investigators at JHU by extending the research capabilities of individual investigators and by serving as a focal point for dissemination and practical training in advanced microscopic methods. Through these efforts, the MPI Core will help establish new strategies for studying brain function in health and disease that will benefit the broader neuroscience community."
"9502297","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common pediatric movement disorder, affecting 3.6/1000 children in the US, with 11,000 new diagnoses every year. Motor and sensory dysfunction in CP often worsen over time, leading to costly lifelong physical, social and emotional disabilities. However, interventions that take advantage of activity-dependent brain plasticity can result in lasting improvements of movement execution and extremity use that optimize motor and social function into adulthood. Among the greatest challenges in the rehabilitation of children with CP is overcoming developmental disregard (DD). This form of neglect starts in infancy impairs the ability to infer new and effective movements and contributes to neurodevelopmental trajectories that rarely equal those of typically developing children. The sooner a therapy can overcome DD, the greater its impact on later neurodevelopment, especially if it can start before 3 years old, when neural plasticity is greatest Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), well-studied in adults, improves upper extremity function through forced-use and sensory exposure of a neglected extremity. The short-term objective of this proposal is to show that CIMT at or before 2 years old can improve upper extremity sensory and motor function and thereby mitigate DD. To accomplish this, the study uses a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with a wait- list control, in children 12-24 months with asymmetric CP. The CIMT intervention includes 1 month of soft constraint wear on the less affected arm (1/2 day sessions, electronically-monitored) combined with a validated parent-implemented home-based program of reach training and sensory exposures for the more affected extremity, in addition to routine therapy sessions (current standard CP treatment). Children with CP will be assessed at baseline, and at 1 and 7 months. Children assigned to the control group will receive CIMT after the RCT is finished and be assessed again. Typically developing (TD) age-matched children will also be tested. The RCT phase of the trial will demonstrate that CIMT improves the sensory and motor function of an affected upper extremity. The comparison of TD children and CP children before treatment will answer mechanistic questions about how the relationship between sensory and motor function contributes to impairments. Finally, referencing all CP children to TD children will provide new information on how the severity of CP and the timing of CIMT may change the neurodevelopmental trajectories of treated children. This will inform the evidence-based design of future trials of rehabilitation n developing children with disabilities. Importantly, the CIMT intervention itself does not involve extensive material and intellectual resources and focuses instead on implementing a carefully monitored home-based program, allowing an application to settings with limited access to resources. The overarching goals of this proposal are therefore to address gaps in the continuum of translational research in the field of pediatric cerebral palsy in order to increase the clinical and societal relevance of this type of rehabilitation research."
"9460968","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) progresses, families are often forced to move their loved ones from home to assisted living facilities or nursing homes. Often, the precipitating factor is disturbed sleep- wake (circadian) cycles, where the person with ADRD is awake at night, causing stress and fatigue to family caregivers. Light therapy has shown great promise as a nonpharmacological treatment in helping regulate sleep in ADRD and in improving cognition. Studies have demonstrated that daytime light exposure can consolidate and increase nighttime sleep efficiency, while increasing daytime wakefulness and reducing evening agitation. More importantly, light exposure during the day has been shown to improve memory in ADRD patients. In our current grant activities, with the goal of increasing the efficacy and acceptability of the treatment, we have developed field measurement methodologies for obtaining accurate circadian light-dark exposures and activity-rest patterns in those with ADRD using the Dimesimeter, a portable, precisely calibrated dime-sized device that records circadian (and visual) light continuously as well as activity for several days or weeks (Aim 1). We have also demonstrated the acceptability of the device by those with ADRD (Aim 2) and we have completed data collection for 56 patients with ADRD and 53 caregivers on the effectiveness of a practical but scientifically sophisticated day-night lighting system designed to improve entrainment to the solar day and improve sleep quality in persons with ADRD and their caregivers living in the home environment (Aim 3). The circadian system is maximally sensitive to short-wavelength (peak close to 460 nm) light. Our research team has shown that 470-nm (blue) light presented in the early evening can consolidate and increase sleep efficiency in assisted living facility residents diagnosed with mild to moderate symptoms of ADRD. Current grant activities indicate that lower levels (300-400 lux at the cornea) of bluish- white light installed in people's homes can significantly improve sleep and reduce depression in ADRD patients. Additional pilot work performed under the grant indicates that the same lighting system increased sleep efficiency, decreased agitation and decreased depression in ADRD patients living in nursing homes. In this competing renewal, we propose to extend the grant work activities and investigate the impact of short- (i.e., 4 weeks) and long-term (i.e., 6 months) exposures to a tailored daytime lighting intervention on agitation, cognition, nighttime sleep measures, and quality of life of those with ADRD living in assisted living and nursing home settings. By combining spectrum and light level, we will effectively stimulate the circadian system without increasing energy costs. We will also investigate the most effective way to deliver the light in these settings and inform manufacturers that can develop new lighting products for this application. Data from these studies can help overcome barriers to the adoption of light as a nonpharmacological intervention to improve sleep and behavior in those with ADRD living in more controlled environments."
"9470917","Summary The purpose of this proposal is to test feasibility and expedite implementation of a multi-center clinical trial of weight-loss in obese patients with poorly controlled asthma within the American Lung Association's Airways Clinical Research Centers network (ALA-ACRC). Obesity is a risk factor for the development of asthma; these patients tend to have poorly controlled asthma and do not respond as well to conventional therapy. Obesity disproportionately affects minority and lower socioeconomic status populations in the United States. Single center studies suggest that weight loss might improve asthma control, but there have been no large multi-center clinical trials addressing the efficacy of weight loss in asthma. Our ultimate purpose is to test the hypothesis that weight loss, through an intensive life style intervention, will improve asthma control. However, we first need to ensure that we can institute a successful weight loss intervention in patients with asthma. We will determine the feasibility of recruiting obese patients with poorly controlled asthma from the17 clinical centers of the ALA-ACRC network by identifying 90 subjects with BMI ? 30 kg/m2 and poorly controlled asthma. At the same time we will perform a pilot study of an internet-based weight loss intervention in two ethnically and geographically distinct centers to determine efficacy of our proposed intervention in producing weight loss in patients with asthma. The results of this proposal will lay the groundwork for a definitive multicenter clinical trial of a weight loss intervention for the treatment of poorly controlled asthma in obese patients. If ultimately successful, this intervention could readily be disseminated as a remote intervention from a centralized location. This would provide an important therapy for the treatment of obese patients with asthma, a population refractory to other treatments."
"9437476","Research has shown that accent ? defined as the manner of pronunciation that is particular to an individual or group of individuals ? can trigger a variety of negative impressions and judgments about a speaker. Like adults, young children treat foreign-accented individuals less positively than those with native accents. These negative reactions to foreign-accented individuals have often been interpreted as evidence of social biases: Because a foreign- accented speaker is viewed as a member of an ?out group,? negative perceptions and attitudes are elicited. An additional possibility, however, is that the impressions are linked to the fluency with which foreign-accented speech is processed: Difficulties in processing lead to negative affect that is misattributed as an unfavorable impression of the speaker. The proposed research will evaluate the role of processing fluency in children?s accent-related biases, and examine implications for modifying those biases  The proposed research assesses 4- to 7-year-old children?s responses to foreign-accented speech, and factors influencing those responses, by asking children to judge the credibility of statements: If a foreign accent results in a negative bias, listeners should be more likely to judge a statement produced by speaker with a foreign accent as false than one produced by a native speaker. These ages are of interest because changes in language representation and processing skills are occurring that could affect fluency of processing. A first study tests the basic question of whether a foreign accent elicits lowered credibility judgments from children. A second experiment evaluates the processing fluency account by independently varying accentedness and comprehensibility in the speech presented to the children. A third study examines the degree to which specific factors?including age, vocabulary size, processing skills, and exposure to accented speech?predict children?s credibility judgements. A fourth study determines whether any initial biases favoring native-accented speech will be overridden if children receive evidence that the speaker is credible. A fifth study evaluates whether observed biases are malleable, by providing children with experience with the specific accents. Finally, a sixth study tests whether general exposure to foreign-accented speech can lead to reductions in accent-related biases.  Non-native speakers of English now account for about 12.5% of the United States? population; many of these individuals have foreign accents. An understanding of the degree to which children exhibit biases against non-native speakers, and the bases for those biases, can lead to strategies for promoting positive interactions between native-accented children and their non-native accented teachers, physicians, peers and other community members."
"9471411","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitosis is the process by which a replicated set of chromosomes is equally distributed between two daughter cells. Because cells require a complete genetic blueprint to function properly, it is essential for mitosis to occur without error mis-segregation of even a single chromosome can be the cause of genetic disease, cancer, and death. Chromosomes are segregated by a microtubule-based cellular machine termed the spindle. A key feature of the spindle is its bipolar geometry, an organization that naturally allow chromosomes to be segregated in two directions. Other organizational states, such as monopolarity or multipolarity, are largely incompatible with life and cause cell death via apoptosis. This renewal application is focused on how spindle bipolarity is both established and maintained. Spindle bipolarity in most eukaryotic cells is established by Eg5, a kinesin-5 motor. However, we discovered in the previous grant cycle that bipolarity in human cancer cells can be established through a novel Eg5-indpendent mechanism. This finding has important clinical implications, as kinesin-5 inhibitors (K5Is) have not performed well as anti-cancer agents in early stage clinical trials. Our work suggests that the inefficacy of K5Is may stem from alternative, compensatory spindle assembly pathways. Once the spindle has formed, it must remain bipolar despite the presence of forces that act in opposition to Eg5. The source, magnitude and temporal fluctuations of Eg5-opposing/assisting forces are not well-characterized, but our data implicate the involvement of kinetochore-attached microtubules (K- MTs). In this grant, we will: 1) Determine when and how K-MTs contribute to bipolarity maintenance; 2) Study features of a second kinesin (Kif15) key for Eg5-independent spindle assembly; and 3) Further characterize non-canonical spindle assembly mechanisms and their physiological shortcomings. This work will advance our understanding of spindle mechanics and have immediate relevance to the development of anti-mitotic chemotherapeutic strategies."
"9475161","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Capitalizing on 15 years of research in multiple laboratories in this area the goal of this Program Project application is to provide a comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of the cross-talk existing between bone and the brain by addressing four issues. First, the discovery that brain-derived serotonin favors bone mass accrual by inhibiting the activity of the sympathetic nervous system raises questions about the transcriptional mechanisms regulating brain serotonin accumulation and catecholamine synthesis. Second, the role played by factors coming from the mothers in the offspring brain development and cognition raises the question that a similar influence for bone mass acquisition may exist. Third, that Tph1, the initial enzyme in the synthesis of gut-derived serotonin is also needed for melatonin synthesis in pineal gland raises the question of the possible role of melatonin as a regulator of bone mass accrual. Our hypothesis is that one extracellular cue limiting the influence of the sympathetic tone on osteoblast functions could be melatonin. Fourth, if we now look at the relationship between bone and the brain from the point of view of bone, the powerful but inhibitory regulation of bone mass accrual by the brain raises the question of whether bone limits this deleterious influence by acting directly in the brain. In addressing these fundamental questions of bone biology and whole-organism physiology the laboratories of the three project leaders of this application have generated in the last five years  enough preliminary data to justify their respective projects. The three major questions tackled by this Program Project are:      * To determine the influences of bone remodeling via osteocalcin on the metabolic status and cognition of mice as they age.      * To demonstrate that one mechanism by which the longevity-associated protein Sirtuin 1 regulates bone mass is through its functions in the brain.      * To define the role of melatonin in bone remodeling during growth, aging and gonadal failure and determine whether maternal by-products of Tph1 are determinants of peak bone mass and future bone health of the offspring."
"9530246","Abstract During the past 30 years, notable advances have been made in understanding the etiologic agent, Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), and the illness that it causes. While ~30,000 cases are reported to the CDC each year, the overall number of Bb-infected patients in the US is estimated to approach 400,000, suggesting that Lyme disease is becoming an epidemic. Signs and symptoms of infection range in severity and most patients recover fully after antimicrobial treatment; however, chronic serious illness and even deaths can still occur. Lyme disease is usually diagnosed by clinical observation of erythema migrans, however, some patients do not develop erythema migrans. Why certain patients have no accompanying symptoms at time of presentation whereas others have numerous symptoms has not been elucidated. Many studies have been published detailing progress in expanding the knowledge base on the microbiology of Bb and on the ecology and epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical aspects but laboratory based diagnosis of Lyme disease is severely lagging behind. It is been estimated that more than 2.7 million serum samples are tested each year for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi-specific antibodies in the United States alone. To meet the demand for laboratory-based diagnosis, various new tests for direct detection of the etiologic agent, or for detection of post-infection specific antibodies by using whole-cell lysates, recombinant antigens, or peptide antigens in enzyme immunoassays (EIA), have been introduced into the clinical laboratory. However, the currently available Lyme disease diagnostics do not meet the specifications for an ideal test, which would be rapid, sensitive, specific, and point-of-care. Currently, the two step FDA approved diagnostic test will only detect the post-infection immune response to Lyme disease pathogen, Bb, but with limited sensitivity and specificity. An ideal Lyme disease diagnostic is a test that is specific for Bb, simple, non-invasive and relies only on readily available samples such as blood or urine. Our proposal will provide specific targets detectable in blood at the earliest time point upon Bb infection. To develop these tests, we will develop a comprehensive quantitative pathogen surfaceome and targeted quantitative Bb protein remnant detection in complex host proteome backgrounds for early Lyme disease detection. We will organize all our data into a publically accessible ?Borrelia PeptideAtlas and Borrelia SRMAtlas? to provide an ongoing resource for Lyme researchers. This proposal will have great impact and contribution to reduce disproportionate identification of Lyme disease through the establishment of novel biomarkers that can stratify patients. The outcome of this project is the identification and verification of highly specific and highly sensitive pathogen targets for development into simple diagnostic assays for early stage Lyme disease patients."
"9460973","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The collection of self-reported survey data for people of all ages is central for monitoring the health and wellbeing of the population. For some experiences, people's self-reports are the only way to acquire the information, e.g., pain, fatigue, and life satisfaction. Given the importance of self-reports, they need to be measured as precisely as possible. There are many considerations for obtaining accurate and comparable self-reports. We examine several factors that are likely to vary by age and influence respondents' interpretations of survey questions and their use of response scales. Such factors could lead to erroneous conclusions about aging and health. A series of five studies, utilizing a range of research techniques from laboratory-based methods to repeated, real-time data collection to Internet panel surveys, is proposed. They will examine age-specific effects (1) in frame-of-reference (the comparison standards people use in making ratings), (2) in the impact of prior questions on responses (context effects), (3) in the effect of recall period on responses (where longer recall periods may be associated with more bias), and (4) in the use of response scales (e.g., tendency to avoid extreme responses). Based on the results of prior studies, the last study will explore ways to improve self- report measurement. Overall, the aim of this application is to identify factors that could impede our ability to understand age-related differences in health and wellbeing, and to develop ways to mitigate those problems."
"9463772","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Continuous PTH (cPTH) treatment exerts a bone catabolic activity while intermittent PTH (iPTH) treatment induces bone anabolism. Our published data indicate that the differential effects of cPTH and iPTH is explained by the specific capacity of cPTH and iPTH to induce T cell production of the osteoclastogenic factor TNF? and the pro-osteogenic Wnt ligand Wnt10b, respectively. Preliminary studies in humans and mice show that cPTH and primary hyperparathyroidism expand Th17 cells and increase the production of IL-17A via a TNF dependent mechanism. By contrast, iPTH in mice and Teriparatide (a form of iPTH treatment) in humans expand regulatory T cells (Tregs), an immunosuppressive population of CD4+ T cells. Demonstrating a role for IL-17 and Tregs, we found that in vivo neutralization of IL-17A blocks the increase in RANKL production by osteocytes (OCYs) and osteoblasts (OBs) and prevents the bone loss induced by cPTH. By contrast, Tregs depletion blunts the bone anabolic activity of iPTH. We thus hypothesize that cPTH and iPTH polarize the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th17 and Tregs, respectively, and that the differential effects of cPTH and iPTH in bone are explained by the specific capacity of cPTH and iPTH to expand Th17 cells and Tregs. Consequently, in Aim 1 we will: a) determine if cPTH induces Th17 cell expansion by increasing TNFR1 and G?S signaling in CD4+ cells, b) determine the contribution of Th17 cell produced IL-17A to cPTH induced bone loss via conditional deletion of Th17 cells, c) investigate if IL-17A signaling in OCYs and/or OBs is required for cPTH to upregulate RANKL production and induce bone loss. In Aim 2 we will determine: a) if iPTH increases the differentiation of Tregs by signaling directly in CD4+ cells vi PTHR1, b) if PTH increases the differentiation of Tregs by increasing the sensitivity of naïve CD4+ cells to TGF? via a notch dependent mechanism, c) if Tregs deletion blocks the anabolic activity of iPTH, and d) if Tregs potentiate iPTH induced Wnt10 production and bone anabolism by blocking CD28 signaling."
"9426133","The most recent outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa reached alarming numbers of infections and deaths, prompting extensive efforts to develop antiviral strategies; however, none have thus far been approved for use in humans. The development of antiviral drugs is mostly based on designing compounds that target viral proteins, but this approach may select for viral escape mutants, and reversion to virulence can occur. In contrast, the identification of host cellular factors required for virus replication may lead to novel therapeutic strategies with a minimal inherent risk of escape mutants. The host ubiquitin system is a conserved cellular pathway important in many functions, including innate immune signaling. Viruses are known to manipulate the ubiquitin system for their own advantage; therefore, the goal of this proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms of EBOV replication involving the ubiquitin system with the long-term goal of applying this knowledge in the development of effective antiviral approaches.  EBOV VP35 is a critical viral protein contributing to pathogenesis because it serves as an essential cofactor of the viral polymerase, thereby promoting efficient replication. Further, VP35 potently blocks innate immunity by inhibiting the host antiviral type-I interferon (IFN-I) system. However, regulation of VP35 function by cellular post-translational modifications is not understood. Our preliminary data suggest that EBOV replication is regulated by a novel mechanism involving VP35 ubiquitination by TRIM6, a host E3-ubiquitin ligase with known antiviral functions. Based on our data, we hypothesize that VP35 hijacks TRIM6 to promote EBOV replication through ubiquitination, while also blocking TRIM6 innate immune signaling activity. By using in vitro and in vivo approaches, including our newly generated TRIM6-knockout mice, we will test how TRIM6 contributes to EBOV replication and pathogenesis. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the mechanistic role of VP35 ubiquitination in EBOV replication. We will use already available EBOV VP35 viral mutants that lack ubiquitination sites and test their function in relation to innate immune antagonism or viral polymerase function. 2) Determine the molecular mechanism by which TRIM6 regulates EBOV replication. We will examine how TRIM6 regulates EBOV replication by using TRIM6 knockout cell lines and in vitro ubiquitination and binding assays. We will also demonstrate that poly-Ub chains synthesized by TRIM6 in vivo promote EBOV replication, using our TRIM6-/- mice and mouse-adapted WT EBOV and the VP35 mutants that lack ubiquitination.  The outcome of these studies is significant because it will provide fundamental knowledge about the mechanism of EBOV replication, which may apply to other viruses. Thus, a common approach for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals may be revealed. Importantly, this work will inform whether a host cellular factor, TRIM6, may be used as a target for the development of novel therapeutic strategy against one of the most lethal viruses of mankind."
"9485776","ABSTRACT. The UW ALACRITY Center purpose is to address critical problems in the implementation of evidence-based psychosocial interventions (EBPIs) for underserved communities as they are delivered in primary care medicine settings. Per a recent IOM report on psychosocial intervention standards, access to EBPIs is hampered by (1) poor clinician training, (2) intervention design complexity, and (3) insufficient support to sustain quality of care. We will attempt to solve these problems by creating a team of researchers from human centered design (Drs. Fogarty, Gonzalez, Munson, Popovic), education (Raue, Popovic), implementation science (Drs. Bennett and Lyon), psychosocial interventions (Drs. Aisenberg, Arean, Kaysen, Raue), health services research (Dr. Fortney, Ratzliff and Unutzer) and research methods (Dr. Atkins and Hoeft). The Center represents a unique partnership between the School of Medicine?s Departments of Psychiatry/Behavioral Sciences and Family Medicine, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, the Department of Communications, and the School of Social Work. The Center also bridges UW?s many resources: CoMotion (UW?s center for health technology innovation), the Institute for Translational Health Sciences (the UW CTSA), the AIMS Center (UW implementation and training center for collaborative care), and the WWAMI-region Practice Research Network (WPRN, a collaborative group of primary care practices through the states of Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho to facilitate innovative community- based research). The Administrative Core will serve as the communication hub between center cores, our two advisory boards, and will oversee the solicitation and selection of R03 level proof of concept studies. The Methods Core (MC) will provide research infrastructure to the projects. Each project will use our Discover, Design, Build and Test framework to address clinician capacity, intervention usability and intervention sustainability. The MC will also compile data from these projects to create a Typology of EBPI Targets and a Matrix of EBPI Modifications that will be shared with other researchers within and outside of UW through our online research community. Research projects will collect a common core of outcomes to determine the impact of modifying EBPI targets on clinicians? quality delivery of care and patient-reported outcomes. The first R34 project proposes to improve clinician EPBI capacity by designing and building an Intelligent Tutor System based on adaptive training. The second R34 project will partner with the WPRN to simplify problem-solving therapy (PST), using user-centered design principles. The third R34 project will partner with the Washington Behavioral Health Integration Program (BHIP) to develop an electronic health record-supported behavioral health module and registry to support sustained clinician skill in delivering PST in primary care. All three projects, and future R03s, will test the effects modification targets of implementation outcomes (time to training, clinician skill drift), system usability, EBPI system burden, system acceptability, and patient-reported outcomes."
"9558872","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT For a long time, the study of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) in humans has been hampered by the fact that absolute AD diagnosis could only be ascertained by assessment of brain pathology upon autopsy. More recently, imaging agents have become available that allow direct imaging of the two hallmarks of AD (amyloid plaques and tau tangles) in living humans. However, these imaging agents are expensive and invasive for use in routine diagnostics. The need for low-cost blood based diagnostic assays has never been greater. C2N Diagnostics has been developing mass spectrometry based assays that investigate amyloid beta peptides in biofluids since 2007. Recent advances in sample cleanup, purification of amyloid beta, and mass spectrometry instrumentation have made it possible to reliably quantify amyloid beta in human plasma samples. Preliminary data from Dr. Randall Bateman?s laboratory at Washington University shows that the ratio of two amyloid beta peptides in plasma can predict the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain. This technology could revolutionize the field of AD diagnostics, and when presented at the Alzheimer?s Association International Conference in July 2017, this discovery was pronounced as ?by far the biggest news of the meeting? by one of the key opinion leaders in AD clinical research. The specific aims of this SBIR Fast-Track application are to analytically and clinically validate C2N?s plasma assay for use as a diagnostic test for predicting brain amyloidosis."
"9536172","Despite advances in model systems for identifying genes involved in aging, many unanswered questions still remain about the biology and underlying mechanisms in humans, particularly related to age-related cognitive decline. This is, in part, because even between mouse and human genomes, genetic regulatory elements have diverged, in sequence, numbers, and their presence in different genes. Additionally, the extreme heterogeneity of cell types in brain is a factor. In this grant, we take on the challenging problem of genetic mechanisms underlying human brain aging. First, we exploit the accumulated wealth of knowledge of the transcriptional repressor, REST, to fully characterize its function in neurons in adult brain. We, and others, have been studying REST for decades as a model for understanding fundamentals of gene regulation because of some prominent features. REST has an easily recognizable unusually large binding site that occurs in thousands of neuronal genes and it robustly signals its function when bound to genes by recruiting chromatin modifiers. While others have reported an activator function for REST in neurons, we have only found repressor function, so we will also settle this discussion in Aim 1. Aim 1 also includes studies to identify ?orphan? REST binding sites of unknown function. The results from this aim will expand the neuronal functions under REST control, as well as provide a potentially new model of repressor function, generally. Second, our preliminary results indicate REST is expressed to different levels in different neuronal types, human and mouse, and that its loss in mice results in differential transcriptional effects in these neurons. This parsing of REST function in human neurons is studied in depth in Aims 2 and 3. We recently found that REST protein levels in human hippocampus increase with age sometime in the second decade after birth, remaining elevated even in centenarians, whereas REST levels in mouse brain are greatly reduced by 4-6m after birth, and stay extremely low for life, suggesting human-specific REST functions and/or target genes with age. We will identify REST functions with age in Aim 2. Third, polymorphisms in REST have been associated with the age-related disease, Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A recent study suggests that REST is involved directly in cognitive decline, although some of the published findings are at odds with our results. We will test hypotheses regarding REST gene regulation in AD in Aim 3. In total, our proposed experiments will provide new information on REST function and its potential impact on neuronal gene expression and chromatin changes during brain aging and related pathologies. The experiments will also provide new information on fundamental questions regarding repressor function.  "
"9505096","The current proposal aims to develop a physical neuroprosthesis system, directly controlled by cortical signals, to restore high-dimension hand functionality to Veterans with chronic tetraplegia resulting from high cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). This unique approach combines an intracortical brain-computer-interface (iBCI) that captures a user?s volitionally intended movements, with a percutaneous functional electrical stimulation (FES) system for activation of paralyzed muscles. While there exist research efforts to use BCIs to control the motion of simple computer cursors and robotic devices, the present proposal will investigate the possibility of restoring high-dimensional multi-grasp control of one?s own paralyzed hand. When realized, this system will enable Veterans with high cervical SCI to cortically command more hand grasp patterns than is realized by current FES neuroprosthetic systems, thereby allowing them to carry out a larger range of everyday grasping tasks. Dexterous hand function is a critical component to being able to perform the object manipulations necessary for successfully completing a wide variety of everyday reaching-and-grasping tasks. For example, the hand grasp required to pick up small flat objects differs from that required to interact with larger cylindrical objects, which differs from the hand grasp required for pointing tasks (e.g. pushing a button). Current clinically relevant neuroprosthetic systems implement one or at most two preprogrammed hand grasp patterns that the user can switch between, though usually not seamlessly. A hand grasp neuroprosthesis that allows users a larger variety of hand grasp patterns by allowing for independent thumb and index finger control, as well as possibly a larger set of switchable preprogrammed grasp patterns, will likely prove functionally advantageous over current clinically available systems. Currently available systems are partly limited in the scope of functionality due to the lack of available signals for commanding the multiple dimensions necessary for increased grasp flexibility. Recording of brain signals directly related to hand function, through an intracortical brain-computer-interface (iBCI) may allow for a richer source of signals for commanding higher dimensions of hand function. This proposal will thus investigate using iBCIs as a command source for implementing a high-dimensional FES hand neuroprostheses, by investigating 1) the possibility of commanding multiple hand grasp types from cortical activity, and 2) the possibility of commanding individual thumb and index movements from cortical activity, thereby allowing the user greater flexibility in creating their own hand grasps. The proposed work will engage Veterans and other participants enrolled in the BrainGate2 Pilot Clinical Trial. As part of the BrainGate2 Pilot Clinical Trial, these participants will already have received a) two intracortical microelectrodes implanted into motor cortical areas controlling arm and hand movements, and b) a percutaneous FES system consisting of small fine-wire electrodes implanted into various muscles of the arm and hand to restore reaching and grasping function through electrical stimulation. Thus this proposal will allow for direct testing of control concepts in Veterans with paralysis. When successful, the proposed work will 1) result in a brain-controlled highly dexterous hand neuroprosthesis for paralyzed Veterans, and 2) offer quantitative insight about the long term potential of iBCIs for commanding complex neuroprosthetic hand function for Veterans considering an intracortical implant for functional grasp restoration after neurological injury or disease."
"9478163","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): TrialNet is an international consortium of clinical research centers that aim to accelerate the path of discovery to approaches to prevent or delay the onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D). TrialNet's current challenge is increasing efficacy and cost-effectiveness of subject recruitment and follow-up, and subsequent participation in prevention trials. In addition, effective T1D research requires a collaborative environment among investigators and with funding agencies, while promoting interest in T1D research among junior investigators, and engaging the larger T1D research community productively.  We propose to establish a Texas Children's Hospital/Baylor College of Medicine (TCH/BCM) TrialNet Clinical Center that includes TCH/BCM in Houston with BCM Children's Hospital in San Antonio as Affiliate. Our program will provide TrialNet access to an extraordinary large pool of candidates by encompassing the two largest cities in Texas into a single Clinical Center. Efficacy and cost -effectiveness will be enhanced by utilizing TCH/BCM widespread health care geographical structure ( six TCH/BCM sites, a community health center, a network of 48 integrated pediatric offices, and BCM Children's Hospital in San Antonio, Texas) to minimize subject travel. Our program will facilitate TrialNet access to study populations of high T1D research interest, such as racial/ethnic minorities, newborns and pregnant women.

"9665656","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease [AD] represents a progressive degenerative illness that affects the brain, resulting in memory impairment. The complex etiology of AD is not fully resolved, although toxic isoforms of amyloid-? (A?) plaques are strongly implicated. Current treatment options are considered to be symptomatic. They are only moderately effective in stabilizing or improving cognitive and functional symptoms. Majority of the research into treatment for Alzheimer's focused on the protein beta amyloid, which is the main component of deposits found in the brain of Alzheimer's sufferers. Unfortunately in the past, many anti-amyloid drugs failed in advanced stages due to safety or efficacy concerns. Thus, there is an unmet need for therapies that halt or substantially slow disease progression.  Over the past decade, our continued research has yielded a system to treat AD. Our treatment strategy is based on the observation that A? peptides are in a dynamic equilibrium between the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). Our lead candidate, Amytrap, is composed of a retro-inverso peptide (RIP) that can sequester toxic ?-amyloid peptides A? -40 and A?-42 in the periphery, thereby drawing these toxic peptides out of the CNS. Our research studies have demonstrated the 'proof of principle' of this sequestration effect in vitro and in vivo. The research focused on evaluating the binding capacity of different RI peptides [Amytrap with different peptide sequences] to peptides A ? -40 and A ? -42 in vitro along with its effects on clearance of plaques from the brain in an AD mouse model. The results show that Amytrap is able to reduce A? levels in brain extracts from AD model mice. The reduction in A? levels was associated with improved memory parameters in these mice. Further we have observed suggestive evidence that administration of Amytrap to AD mice at younger age is more effective. This important piece of observation is consistent with the recent findings resulting fro failed/re-emerging human clinical trials. We have further improved the properties of this Amytrap system by linking the RIP to albumin. One of the advantages of the albuminized peptide is the absence of any untoward immune reactions. Recently, we have obtained additional evidence via imaging experiments that Amytrap does not cross the BBB thus reassuring our peripheral sink hypothesis. However, Amytrap warrants further investigation to test its potential as a disease modifying agent. In this phase 2 application, we attempt the next logical decision making point. We propose to conduct expanded studies on efficacy, genetic toxicology and safety pharmacology of the Amytrap molecule. Studies will focus on understanding the properties of Amytrap and translating them to practical applications which will enable us to commercialize Amytrap. Determining the minimum and maximum effective dose of the Amytrap molecule on performance in the y maze is one of our primary goals that will result in a therapeutic index. We plan to examine the genotoxic potential of Amytrap by standard experiments in vitro and in vivo. We will consequently conduct safety pharmacology studies and evaluate the effect of Amytrap on the CNS, respiratory and cardiac systems over long term. We believe Amytrap is ideally positioned in that it closely resembles its biological target. Further, Amytrap is safe and economical with no side effects. Therefore, we anticipate that Amytrap will be accepted in humans. The proposed commercialization plan includes a strong research team [including a CRO, well verse with IND enabling studies], a comprehensive business plan and commitments from potential strategic partners including Connecticut Innovations Inc [CII] and BioPharma Strategy Advisors, CA. To this effect, CII has already awarded a small grant to RT to fund efforts to bridge the phase 1 with the phase 2 research. The outcome of the proposed phase 2 studies is expected to satisfy mandatory requirements to position Amytrap for a future investigative new drug [IND] filing and subsequent human clinical testing."
"9675657","Mobility and Fate of Asbestos Particles in the Environment: Minimizing the threat that asbestos disposal  sites present to surrounding communities requires containment; preventing offsite migration is of paramount  importance. Because asbestos fibers are most hazardous when inhaled, research has focused on airborne  transport. However, there is now ample empirical evidence that aqueous transport - in groundwater and rivers  - is a significant pathway for spreading of asbestos, and such transport has threatened drinking water supplies  in some areas. Because asbestos particles have a large specific surface area, surface charge effects are  strong and presumably influence their mobility and interaction with the environment. In particular, asbestos  fibers rarely exist in isolation but rather form aggregates; however, little is known regarding the mechanisms  controlling aggregate formation. In addition, the unusually large aspect ratio of asbestos is expected to exert a  strong control on the migration and trapping of particles in groundwater transport through soil; however no  studies have examined aqueous transport in the laboratory. We hypothesize that aggregate size exerts the  primary control on the rate of trapping of asbestos particles in soil, and that such trapping  (straining) may reversed under changing water chemistry. We propose to test these hypotheses with  three Specific Aims. Aim 1: To elucidate the physico-chemical processes controlling asbestos aggregate  formation and mobility. Aim 2: Determine mobility and straining of asbestos in groundwater, through laboratory  experiments and theory. Aim 3: To identify the extent of groundwater transport, and the size distribution of  aggregates, for asbestos particles at the Ambler Superfund site; and make recommendations for containment  of asbestos to limit aqueous transport. Our key innovations are to: (1) probe the dynamics of asbestos at the  fiber scale using real-time electron-microscopy observations; (2) perform innovative soil column experiments  that allow us to image the internal granular pore structure; and (3) apply experimentally-validated theories to  field observations at a Superfund site to make scientifically-informed recommendations for improving  containment strategies of asbestos. We believe that the proposed research will directly inform policy for  asbestos containment at Superfund and Brownfields sites, while bringing immediate benefit to the community  surrounding the Ambler asbestos piles."
"9507894","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The Indiana Regional Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Center (IRCCTC) will extend the work of the Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network, particularly in the area of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Critical limb ischemia (CLI) results in at least 50,000 amputations annually, with a cost estimated at $4.3 billion/year. In a recent Phase l/ll trial we have demonstrated safety and feasibility of intra-muscular injection of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (ABMNC) in patients with CLI, and provided initial evidence that this treatment improves amputation-free survival at one year. Although these results are promising, there is an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of cell therapy for CLI by identifying more potent sources of progenitor cells and by evaluating functional characteristics of transplanted cells. While many cardiovascular cell-based trials have focused on ABMNC, adipose stromal cells (ASCs) have demonstrated qualities particularly suitable for promoting limb salvage in CLI. In addition, cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMNC) have been shown to include vasculogenic endothelial progenitor cells, to augment perfusion in ischemic limbs, and to be tolerated by an immunocompetent host. CLI presents an excellent opportunity to examine these two readily accessible cell populations with regard to suitability for cardiovascular cell therapy, in that there exist no other options fo salvage of the index limb, potential adverse events are not immediately life-threatening, and tissue can be obtained for analysis in the event of amputation. Also, mechanisms promoting limb salvage in CLI have relevance to myocardial ischemic syndromes. In this application for a new Regional Center, we propose two protocols, respectively evaluating allogeneic cord blood mononuclear cells and adipose stromal cells as potential therapies for CLI. Aim 1 will evaluate whether CBMNC are superior to placebo in promoting amputation-free survival at 1 year in subjects with critical limb ischemia of Rutherford Category 4, and no /high-risk options for standard revascularization. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that adipose stromal cells (ASCs) are safe and may increase time to amputation in subjects with critical limb ischemia and ulcers / tissue loss (Rutherford Category 5-6)."
"9456722","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this proposal is to elucidate the role of cilia on cells of the olfactory epithelium (OE) in the regulation and maintenance of olfactory function and their alterations in cilia-related disorders. Olfactory dysfunction in the general population is frequent, affecting at least 2.5 million people in the U.S. alone. In at leas 20% of the cases the etiology of the chemosensory disturbance cannot be identified. Recently, we were one of the first to demonstrate olfactory dysfunction as a clinical manifestation of an emerging class of human genetic disorders, termed ciliopathies. It is surprising that while many of the ascribed functions of cilia are reported to occur in the OE and cilia are abundant on OSNs, we have an incomplete understanding of the role of cilia in this sensory tissue. New data in this application show that horizontal basal cells (HBCs) possess cilia (previously thought to exist in the OE only on olfactory sensory neurons) that may regulate proliferation or differentiation of olfactory stem cells. Therefore, investigation into the possible pleotropic role of cilia in the OE is necessary. Importantly, despite significant progress identifying the genes underlying ciliopathies, curative therapies are not yet available to patients. Recently, we reported that odor detection can be restored to animals with a hypomorphic mutation in the gene encoding for the ciliary protein IFT88 that results in the loss of cilia on differentiated olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs)(ref). This suggests that ectopic gene delivery in vivo may provide a viable approach to treating olfactory dysfunction resulting from ciliopathies. We hypothesize that ciliopathy alleles and loss of cilia genes affect the function of both OSNs and HBCS to reduce olfactory function, which can be therapeutically rescued by ectopic, adenoviral-gene expression in vivo. Therefore, we will test the following Specific Aims: (1) Elucidate the effects of cilia loss from olfactory sensory neurons and the extent of functional rescue following ectopic adenoviral gene delivery in vivo; (2) Determine the effects of sensory depravation by cilia loss on olfactory bulb organization and function and its plasticity following restoration; (3 Establish the necessity of cilia for the regulation of HBC proliferation and differentiation in the developing, mature, and injured OE. Successful completion of this work will undoubtedly provide us important new information regarding the pathogenesis of human sensory perception diseases and paves the way for the development of treatments in humans, where no curative therapies for ciliopathic disease exist."
"9506262","Project Summary  Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) that occurs in critically ill patients who receive mechanical ventilation is a serious nosocomial complication that can prolong hospitalization, increase mortality, and reduce long term quality of life and cognitive function. Modification of the design of the endotracheal tube (ETT) that allows continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions through an extra port positioned between the cuff and the vocal cords may prevent leakage of contaminated secretions around the cuff and thereby reduce the risk of VAP. The replacement of the standard polyvinylchloride (PVC) cuff material with polyurethane (PU) may further protect from microaspiration. We previously successfully completed a randomized pilot controlled trial of two modified ETTs in patients requiring emergency intubation to establish the feasibility of a larger trial to address the long-term safety and effectiveness of modified ETTs.  We propose a Phase II, randomized, controlled trial that will equally randomize patients requiring emergency endotracheal intubation to receive either a PU-cuffed ETT equipped with continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions (PU-CASS-ETT, n=537) or a conventional, PVC-cuffed ETT (PVC-ETT, n=537). Similar to the pilot study, this trial will be conducted under Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC) in the four adult ICUs at Oregon Health & Science University. The units of randomization will be the intubation kits which will contain in a concealed manner one of the two ETT models provided in duplicate in two appropriate gender-specific sizes. The trial primary aim is to determine if PU-CASS-ETT is as safe as PVC-ETT and if long-term patient quality of life and cognitive function are better in PU-CASS-ETT, compared with PVC-ETT. The co-primary safety endpoint is the evaluation of the safety profile based on upper airway-related complications and laryngeal dysfunction collected via in person interview, compared with the PVC-ETT, at 6 months after randomization. We will also monitor any device-related adverse events. Our co-primary effectiveness endpoint is quality of life, as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey, and cognitive function, as assessed by the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set, at 6 months after randomization. The secondary endpoints include the incidence of infection-related ventilator associated conditions (IVAC) and ventilator associated events (VAEs), as defined by the Center for Disease Control, respiratory antibiotics use, incidence of ?clinical? VAP, 28-day ventilator-free days, mean daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, length of ICU and hospital stay, and mortality up to six months will serve to evaluate other clinical meaningful consequences resulting from the occurrence of VAP. Furthermore, the study will perform economic evaluation (cost-consequence approach) of quality of life, healthcare resource utilization and cost for hospitals. Primary and secondary endpoints will be compared between the PU-CASS-ETT and PVC-ETT groups, using an intention-to-treat approach."
"9435628","ABSTRACT  Polymicrobial infections are difficult to treat because of either inherent or acquired resistance of microbes to different classes of antibiotics. During polymicrobial infections, synergistic augmentation of the virulence potential of pathogens is a significant concern with devastating patient outcomes. While mixed infections may represent association of diverse groups of bacteria, mutualistic, synergistic, or antagonistic relationships can occur between bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Alarmingly, how multispecies interactions govern progression and disease severity and how the host responds to such polymicrobial or monomicrobial infections are poorly understood. While studying a human case of necrotizing fasciitis (NF), we identified Aeromonas hydrophila to be the causative agent and the infection was considered monomicrobial. However, after deep sequencing of DNA from infected tissues and bioinformatics analysis, we determined that the infection, in fact, involved four strains of the same pathogen with differing virulence; three strains (designated as NF2, NF3, and NF4) were clonal, while the fourth strain, NF1, was phylogenetically distinct. Thus, a classically defined monomicrobial infection (a single species) may actually be polymicrobial when different strains of the same bacterial species are present. This concept extends the classical Koch?s postulates to now encompass monomicrobial and polymicrobial infections caused by either (i) a pure culture or (ii) a mixture of bacterial strains of the same species. To our knowledge, we have identified for the first time a toxin (ExoA) that is responsible for synergistic/crosstalk events in mono-species polymicrobial strain infection. In addition, the presence of a type 6 secretion system (T6SS) effector and immunity protein was noted in NF1 based on genome analysis which was absent from the strain NF2. Our results of mixed infection in a mouse model of NF clearly indicated interactive processes of both synergistic augmentation and antagonistic attenuation of virulence of two distinct strains, NF1 and NF2. However, the molecular mechanisms governing such cross-talk among strains with differing genome signatures are poorly understood and will be explored. In Aim 1, the role of the type 6 secretion system and its effector TseC and immunity protein TsiC in contact-dependent killing of NF2 by NF1, the latter of which only harbors this effector:immunity protein pair, will be evaluated with both in vitro and in vivo models using metagenomics tools and luciferase-marked strains. In Aim 2, the role of ExoA (of NF2) in modulating bacterial motility to facilitate better dissemination of NF1 (without ExoA) in an in vivo model of NF will be delineated. Further, protective effects of ExoA antibodies in mice against development of NF will be investigated. The overall significance of our study also translates to many other diseases which are polymicrobial in nature. Importantly, development of alternate therapeutics to combat bacteria with distinct antibiotic profiles in the context of mono-species polymicrobial infections is critical to prevent devastating disease sequelae. The central question of how one strain promotes the spread of the second strain, and how the second strain promotes clearance of the first is very exciting and forms the basis of our study."
"9593253","Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella flexneri are human intestinal pathogens that replicate in the cytosol of infected cells and spread directly from primary infected cells to adjacent cells. The dissemination process is a fundamental aspect of pathogenesis as spreading-defective bacterial mutants are essentially avirulent. The ability of L. monocytogenes and S. flexneri to spread from cell to cell is related to their ability to display actin- based motility in the cytosol of infected cells. These bacteria produce virulence factors that lead to the recruitment at their surface of an essential host cell actin nucleator, the ARP2/3 complex. This results in actin polymerization at one pole of the bacteria, which propels the rods throughout the cytosol. Seminal electron microscopy studies revealed that, when bacteria reach the cell cortex, they form plasma membrane extensions that project into the cytosol of adjacent cells. These protrusions are resolved in adjacent cells into double membrane vacuoles, from which the pathogens escape by producing virulence factors that disrupt the integrity of eukaryotic membranes. In contrast to our advanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms supporting cytosolic actin-based motility, the mechanisms supporting pathogen dissemination through membrane protrusion formation are unresolved. To address this gap in knowledge, we have developed innovative procedures for imaging intracellular pathogen dissemination and identified cellular and bacterial factors supporting bacterial pathogen spread from cell to cell. In previous work, we defined the cellular machinery and the bacterial factors specifically required for L. monocytogenes spread from cell to cell. Recently, we uncovered the notion that, although utilizing similar mechanisms of actin-based motility in the cytosol, L. monocytogenes and S. flexneri have evolved different strategies of cell-to-cell spread. Unlike L. monocytogenes, S. flexneri hijacks phosphoinositide (PI(3)P) signaling in protrusions in order to facilitate their resolution into vacuoles. Here, we propose to gain the first mechanistic insight into the bacterial and cellular mechanisms supporting S. flexneri PI(3)P-dependent dissemination (Aim1 and Aim2); and the role of PI(3)P-dependent dissemination in pathogenesis (Aim3)."
"9545305","Abstract NLGNs are known to play crucial roles in synaptogenesis and the maturation of the postsynaptic density through recruitment of and interactions with scaffolding proteins, neurotransmitter receptors, and ion channels. It has been shown that NRXN binding is crucial for NLGN function, as NRXN is capable of clustering NLGNs at the postsynaptic density (PSD) and initiating recruitment of downstream interacting proteins necessary for synapse stabilization and maturation. Most vertebrates possess four NLGN genes: NLGN1, NLGN2, NLGN3, and NLGN4. In most mammals, NLGN4 is located on the X chromosome, however in higher order primates such as Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes NLGN4X is complemented on the Y chromosome (sometimes referred to as NLGN5) with nearly 98% homology to NLGN4X. It is believed that this NLGN4Y isoform originated from a duplication event that occurred relatively recently during evolution Unlike almost all vertebrates, humans possess X chromosome and Y chromosome isoforms of NLGN4, however the function of NLGN4 at synapses remains unknown. We intend to investigate the functional properties of NLGN4X and NLGN4Y such as NRXN binding, synaptogenesis, and localization. We plan on addressing these questions with the following three specific aims: 1) Determine whether NLGN4X and NLGN4Y are localized to human synaptic sites. 2) Determine the affinities of NLGN4X and NLGN4Y for NRXN. 3) Determine the molecular mechanism responsible for differences in the synaptogenic activity of NLGN4X and NLGN4Y. We have conducted experiments to demonstrate that we can achieve the goals of each of the three ambitious aims we proposed. For specific aim 1, we established approaches to study NLGN function in human brain tissue and cells. For Specific aim 2, we have established an assay and begun experiments to determine the affinity of NLGN4 in biological sex-specific combinations. For specific aim 3, we have begun experiments using a synapse assay system and expressed NLGN4X and NLGN4Y and generated constructs to begin structure function analysis. Together these preliminary data indicate that we are poised to make rapid progress on our understanding of these sexually dimorphic genes. Results are likely to shed light on the matter of synaptic dysfunction in disorders such as ASD and learning disabilities and propose a potential difference in synaptic function between males and females."
"9528898","Project Summary/Abstract  Plasticity of cortical motor networks is a critical mediator of skilled motor learning and a potential mechanism for supporting the rehabilitation of motor function after neurological injury. Fundamental to the understanding of how the remodeling of these cortical networks supports skilled motor control is the ability to record from identified cell types during the stages of skill acquisition and rehabilitation. Recent advances in two-photon imaging and the development of genetically encoded calcium indicators has allowed for an understanding of the dynamics of neural networks during motor learning. However, execution of the simple motor tasks currently in use in head- fixed mice are not sensitive to disruption of cortical motor networks, while more complex tasks currently require high speed video analysis and post-experimental processing. There is a critical need to develop unbiased testing devices for skilled, corticospinal-dependent behaviors to use in concert with modern in vivo imaging techniques. The long-term goal is to develop novel therapeutic interventions for the recovery of function after spinal cord injury through an understanding of the cellular and subcellular mechanisms that drive neural circuit remodeling. The overall objective for this proposal is to develop a system for assessing a complex, corticospinal-dependent behavior for use in future in vivo imaging studies of skilled motor learning and rehabilitation. In order to achieve this objective, the automated, objective supination task will be adapted for use in head-fixed mice during two- photon imaging. The rationale for developing this tool for use during in vivo imaging in head-fixed mice is that it will allow for the study of cortical motor networks during both the learning and rehabilitation of skilled, corticospinal-dependent, stereotyped forelimb movements in an unbiased manner in real time. The objective for this proposal will be met by addressing the following two specific aims: 1) Adapt a supination task for mice and determine the effects of corticospinal tract injury; and 2) Adapt the supination task for use in head-fixed mice and validate its use for the study of corticospinal neuron activity in vivo. Under the first aim, a reduced scale version of the Vulintus, Inc. MotoTrak rat supination task will be adapted for mice in concert with Vulintus, Inc., after which the effects of corticospinal tract injury will be tested on the supination task. Under the second aim, the supination task will be adapted for head-fixed mice and calcium transients will be used to study the response of corticospinal neurons to injury. The proposed work is innovative in that it will result in novel tools for the study of skilled, corticospinal-dependent motor learning and the activity of cortical motor networks in vivo in a quantitative, reproducible, and unbiased manner. The proposed work is significant as it will allow for vertical advancements in the study of skilled motor learning and rehabilitation after neurological injury. Ultimately, these tools have the potential to be applied broadly to study both the mechanisms of motor learning and the effects of neurological dysfunction, whether developmental or induced by injury and disease."
"9541552","Bone is a frequent site of breast cancer metastasis and relapse, however treatment of bone metastasis remains largely ineffective as the mechanisms underlying its initiation and progression are unclear. Increasing evidence suggests that primary tumors release soluble factors and extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can systemically prime distant metastatic sites to form pre-metastatic niches, which are microenvironments supportive of future tumor cell attachment, survival, and growth. Our preliminary data indicate that breast cancer-derived factors can promote osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), leading to increased bone matrix production and mineralization. This may be a critical aspect of the bone pre-metastatic niche, as recent studies revealed that breast cancer cells initially localize to regions of active osteogenesis in bone. However, our current understanding of the functional connections between EVs, local osteogenesis, and bone metastasis is limited due in part to a lack of model systems and quantitative approaches that would resolve the spatial and temporal dynamics of pre-metastatic niche establishment in bone. Here, I hypothesize that tumor cell-derived factors promote the development of an osteogenic pre-metastatic niche in bone, which aids in tumor cell colonization of bone. To address this hypothesis, I propose to use a combination of established mouse models, engineered in vitro mineralized models of the bone microenvironment, and innovative imaging and analysis tools for quantitative evaluation of bone formation. In Aim 1, I will characterize the effect of tumor-derived factors on osteogenic activity in bones of mice and in MSC cultures pre-conditioned with tumor factors. I further dissect the respective roles of soluble factors and EVs in mediating the effects of tumor-derived factors on osteogenic activity in vitro. In Aim 2, I will investigate the influence of tumor-derived factor-induced osteogenic activity on tumor cell colonization and proliferation in bone using a mouse model of bone metastasis and the novel application of a bone serial milling technique to analyze the 3D localization of tumor cells with respect to regions of osteogenic activity. Knowledge gained from this work will further our understanding of the specific mechanisms underlying bone metastasis, which may be applicable to other types of bone-metastatic cancers (e.g. prostate, lung, and kidney). Furthermore, this work may directly improve patient outcome by revealing potential therapeutic targets to prevent bone metastasis. !"
"9554112","Developing effective therapies for ALS patients has proven to be extraordinarily challenging. The reasons are many and complex, but dominant amongst these are the phenotypic heterogeneity of the ALS patient population and the insensitivity of clinical outcome measures to therapeutic effect during phase II clinical trials. The result is that it is very difficult to make well informed go/no-go decisions at the end of phase II with respect to which drugs to move forward into phase III clinical trials. Specific types of biomarkers are widely believed to hold great promise in helping to overcome these barriers. Prognostic biomarkers that help to predict the course of disease by adding value to what can be determined from readily available clinical parameters, might be used as eligibility or stratification criteria to ensure more homogeneous study populations within which treatment effect may be more readily demonstrable. Biomarkers whose longitudinal trajectory (and variability) is well defined have the potential to serve as pharmacodynamic biomarkers of treatment effect. Showing for example, that an experimental therapeutic leads to normalization of a biomarker level, would provide supportive evidence for the therapeutic effect of an experimental compound and help to empower decisions to advance the particular therapeutic agent into the next phase of clinical development. Intense discovery efforts over the course of the last 10+ years have yielded a plethora of biomarker candidates, but none of these have yet been validated in a multi-center fashion. In this project we aim do close this knowledge gap by undertaking a multi- center validation study of the lead biological-fluid-based biomarker candidates ? urinary p75 neurotrophin receptor extracellular domain (p75ECD), blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated neurofilament heavy (pNfH), blood and CSF neurofilament light (NfL) and, in the population with a C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and CSF levels of the dipeptide repeat protein poly(GP). To accomplish the proposed aims of validating these biomarkers, we will leverage the ongoing activities of the CReATe Consortium through which ~500 ALS patients will be deeply phenotyped longitudinally, undergo whole genome sequencing, and from whom a relevant set of biological fluids are being collected and stored."
"9519774","Twenty-five percent of older adults experience significant osteoarthritis (OA)-related comorbid sleep disturbance. Insomnia is associated with substantial negative effects on function, mood, and medical resource utilization. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is evidence- based and has been shown to be efficacious in populations with a variety of comorbid conditions including OA-related chronic pain. However, in-person CBT interventions are unlikely to be widely deployable in healthcare systems. Telephone delivery has the advantage of giving patients access to personalized, efficacious CBT-I interventions from home, increasing generalizability, and outreach to minority, rural, and other underserved populations. Previous small trials of telephone CBT-I have reported positive insomnia outcomes, but no large randomized trials have assessed its long-term efficacy, impact on related outcomes in a primary care patient population, or cost-effectiveness. This proposal builds upon our successful completion of two randomized trials of CBT for insomnia with older adults: Lifestyles, a trial of group CBT in older adults with OA-related insomnia and pain, and MsFLASH04, a trial of telephone CBT-I for insomnia in menopausal women with comorbid vasomotor symptoms. Older (60+ yrs) primary care patients across Washington State will be screened for severe persistent OA-related insomnia and pain. Two hundred and seventy patients will be randomized to either CBT-I or an education only attention control (EOC). Each treatment will consist of six 20-30 minute telephone-based sessions over an eight week period. Pre-treatment, post-treatment (2 months), and 9 and 18 month assessments will include measures of sleep, pain, fatigue, mood, and quality of life. A cost effectiveness evaluation of the intervention will also be conducted. We hypothesize: 1) CBT-I will produce significantly greater initial and long-term improvements in sleep outcomes relative to EOC; 2) CBT-I will produce significantly greater initial and long-term improvements in pain, fatigue and mood relative to EOC; and 3) CBT-I will produce long-term reductions in health care utilization and costs relative to EOC. We will also explore whether changes in insomnia severity explain observed effects of CBT-I on secondary outcomes (mediator analysis), and whether CBT-I effects on insomnia differ by baseline insomnia, pain, or depression symptom severity (moderator analysis). The proposed research will determine if telephone CBT-I improves OA insomnia and associated outcomes in a state-wide primary care population of older adults, and inform policy decisions about widespread dissemination of telephone CBT-I in this and related patient populations."
"9634206","Project Summary Abstract - R01ES016893 Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), also known as chromate, is a major public health concern. Chromates, particularly the insoluble compounds, are well-established human lung carcinogens. Our study focuses on investigating the mechanisms of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis, which are currently unknown. Recent studies indicate that particulate Cr(VI) induces chromosome instability, which is a hallmark of human lung tumors. However, how Cr(VI) induces chromosome instability is poorly understood. Our preliminary data show that chronic exposure to particulate Cr(VI) induces a DNA repair deficient phenotype that underlies the chromosome instability, and thus, the goal of this research is to characterize this repair deficiency and its impact and understand the mechanisms that cause it to occur. We will test the hypothesis that particulate Cr(VI) induces epigenetic changes inactivating homologous recombination repair of Cr(VI)-induced DNA double strand breaks resulting in increased chromosome instability and carcinogenesis. We will test this hypothesis through four interrelated specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize the homologous recombination repair defect and show that particulate Cr(VI) causes cells to inactivate Rad51-mediated response and switch to lower fidelity non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair using immunoblotting, immunofluorescence and repair assays. Aim 2 will show that the cells with particulate Cr(VI)-inactivated Rad51 response acquire chromosome instability and undergo neoplastic transformation using cytogenetic techniques and assays for contact- uninhibited and anchorage independent growth. Aim 3 will identify an epigenetic change (increased acetylation) that causes the loss of Rad51 response by affecting E2F1, ATM, Rad51C and Rad51 with assays for acetylation status, gene expression, and protein interactions and localization. Finally, Aim 4 will characterize the mechanism for particulate Cr(VI)-induced acetylation changes studying Cr(VI) binding to acetyl groups using assays for acetylation and histone deacetylase activity. Each aim will focus on human lung cells and confirm key findings in human Cr(VI) tumors. Results will lead to the first reports of detailed information of the interactions of Cr(VI with DNA double strand break machinery, acetylation status and the first characterizations of these aspects in tumors from Cr(VI)-exposed workers. This research is significant because it will provide: 1) An understanding of particulate Cr(VI)'s carcinogenic mechanism; 2) Essential information to better assess the risk of exposure to particulates; and 3) A mechanistic approach for further study of Cr(VI), other metals, and lung cancer in general."
"9476160","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young female sexual minorities (YFSM) are at exceptionally high risk for intimate partner violence (IPV), with over half of YFSM reporting physical or sexual abuse by a dating partner. These young IPV victims may be particularly vulnerable to the negative physical and mental health consequences of IPV, including substance abuse, depression, and suicide, due to minority stress and diminished protective resources (e.g., parent support, community connectedness). In addition, YFSM may be less likely to report and to seek or receive help for IPV because they are not out about their sexual orientation or they fear stigmatization and discrimination. Women who seek help for same-sex IPV are often denied services (e.g., two-thirds of LGBT IPV survivors were denied access to domestic violence shelters) and feel marginalized and unsupported by domestic violence service systems. Basic research is clearly needed to inform development of culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions to prevent IPV in YFSM and to support female sexual minority IPV victims. The existing literature, however, has almost exclusively focused on IPV in heterosexuals. Because LGBT teens and young adults face unique issues surrounding their relationships and sexual behaviors (e.g., pressures to deny or conceal sexual identity and activities), the risk and protective factors for IPV, help-seeking behaviors, and consequences of IPV in sexual minority youth are likely quite different from those observed in heterosexual youth. The overarching goal of this project is to begin to address these disparities by conducting an innovative study of IPV in female sexual minority adolescents and young adults (YFSM). We propose a novel, minority stress-informed dynamic developmental systems perspective of IPV in YFSM, which we will test using a mixed-methods, accelerated longitudinal design. Building upon the longest running study of LGBT youth, we will collect quantitative data from two ethnically diverse cohorts of YFSM (N= 530; ages 16-26) every six months for two years, as well as qualitative data from 50 selected participants. We will accomplish the overarching goal with four primary specific aims: (1) Describe the nature and trajectories of IPV in YFSM across adolescence and young adulthood; (2) Identify risk and protective factors for IPV among YFSM, including factors that differentiate violent vs. non-violent/healthy relationships; (3) Examine factors that affect YFSM's reporting of IPV, help-seeking for IPV, and ability to benefit from help  provided (e.g., cultural competence of providers); and (4) Evaluate the consequences of IPV in YFSM, identifying factors that raise risk for or protect YFSM victims from revictimization and negative health consequences of IPV. Integration of the resulting quantitative and qualitative data will be used to inform the development of evidence-based interventions to prevent IPV among YFSM and better serve those who experience IPV. 1"
"9599625","Abstract  It is widely accepted that cell-type specific gene regulation is primarily achieved by cell-type specific expression of transcription factors (TFs), which bind to specific DNA sequence and initiate changes in higher- order chromatin structures by recruiting chromatin modifiers. While TFs are often expressed in a cell-type specific manner, chromatin modifiers are ubiquitously expressed in general. It remains largely unknown if cell- type specific chromatin modifiers govern unique chromatin structure. Recent genome-wide studies of the genetic basis of cognitive deficits such as autism and intellectual disability syndromes have implicated numerous genes involved in methylation of histones. Why is the brain so sensitive to histone methylation dysregulation? Is neuronal chromatin unique compared to other cell types? The research proposed here begins to address these major questions by testing new concept that neuron-specific splicing events govern unique methyl-histone regulation, thereby ensuring proper neuronal development.  The focus in the proposed project is the LSD1-PHF21A histone demethylation complex. LSD1 is a histone demethylase, which is specific for mono- and di-methylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1/2). PHF21A is the first-discovered unmethylated-histone ?reader? protein, which recognizes unmethylated H3K4 (H3K4me0), the reaction product of canonical LSD1 (LSD1-c). Both LSD1 and PHF21A haploinsufficiencies lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting their importance in brain development. Meanwhile, a recent study showed that 3-27 nucleotide ?microexons? are predominantly generated in the neuronal via alternative splicing. Microexons are evolutionally conserved and misregulated in autism patients and predicted to influence protein-protein interactions. Intriguingly, the neuronal LSD1 isoform (LSD1-n), which carries a microexon in its catalytic domain, appears to have distinct substrate specificity. However, it remains controversial which lysine(s) LSD1-n targets and what LSD1-n does as a multi-subunit complex within neurons.  The overall objective of this proposal is to explore the neuron-specific roles of the LSD1-PHF21A complex. The research team will 1) compare the function of canonical PHF21A and neuron-specific PHF21A isoform (PHF21A-n) in histone binding and LSD1-mediated demethylation, and 2) determine the roles of PHF21A-n in synapse development and the neuronal transcriptome. The proposed project is exploratory, because analysis of the neuron-specific methyl-histone regulatory complex lacks precedents; therefore, the project fits well with the R21 mechanism. Completion of these aims will be the first test of the hypothesis that methyl histone regulatory complexes function uniquely in post-mitotic neurons as a result of neuron-specific alternative splicing. As such, this research will provide both mechanistic insight into the regulation of histone modifications and a better understanding of the pathogenesis of neurodevelopment disorders, which could lead to novel approaches for brain-specific therapeutic targets."
"9698541","Abstract Chromosomal instability (CIN) contributes to carcinogenesis by promoting aneuploidy. Arsenic is well known to induce aneuploidy, however the molecular mechanism by which arsenic induces aneuploidy-mediated carcinogenesis is yet to be delineated. We have identified a miRNA (hsa-miR-186) that is overexpressed in arsenic-induced squamous cell carcinoma and that induces CIN when overexpressed in human keratinocytes. This miRNA is encoded within intron 9 of the ZRANB2 gene and is co-transcribed as part of the ZRANB2 transcript. Such embedded microRNAs are processed out of the intronic RNA by the microRNA maturation machinery. ZRANB2 encodes an alternative splicing factor containing two zinc fingers each with four-cysteines coordinating the zinc. These types of zinc fingers are targets for arsenite displacement of zinc. We hypothesize that chronic arsenic exposure disrupts ZRANB2 function by displacing zinc from the zinc fingers; cellular homeostatic mechanisms induce ZRANB2 transcription; coincident increased hsa-miR-186 leads to CIN contributing to arsenic-induced carcinogenesis. This project will determine the role of hsa-miR-186 in arsenic induced CIN in human keratinocytes, and how ZRANB2 structure and function are modulated by arsenic exposure. The following specific aims will be pursued to test this hypothesis: 1. Determine role of hsa-miR-186 in carcinogenic transformation of immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT cells).; 2. Determine mechanism of arsenite disruption of ZRANB2 structure and function; 3. Determine potential of hsa-miR-186 over-expression to induce chromosomal instability and potential of arsenite to inhibit ZRANB2 directed splicing in primary keratinocytes. Successful completion of these aims will demonstrate a novel mechanism for epigenetic response to the environmental stress of arsenic exposure and demonstrate that this response causes chromosomal instability (CIN) linked to arsenic-induced skin carcinogenesis. This mechanism likely plays a role in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis in other organs as well. Thus, hsa-miR-186 could be a biomarker for arsenic induced internal cancers in arsenic exposed patients. Demonstration of arsenite-exposure disturbance of mRNA splicing patterns will open a new area of research into mechanisms of arsenic induced disease."
"9531467","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Approximately 1/3 of people living with epilepsy (PWE) continue to have seizures despite anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Recent trials using therapeutic brain stimulation show reductions in seizures, but rarely provide seizure free outcomes. Although seizures occupy a small fraction of their life, as little as 0.01%, PWE take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively managed, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with accurate seizure diaries, real-time seizure forecasting, and responsive stimulation for brain state modulation. With accurate seizure forecasting patients would be empowered to manage their life activities. The optimal epilepsy management device requires: 1) Automated seizure detection 2) Accurate Automated Electronic Seizure Diaries 3) Seizure Forecasting and 4) Programmable Brain Stimulation. In this grant we develop an epilepsy management and therapy platform using Medtronic's 3rd generation device implantable device. The RC+S provides chronic nervous system sensing and analytics using embedded scientific instrumentation (e.g. - sensors, classification, and control policy implementation), and provides a unique opportunity for exploring and managing epileptic neural networks."
"9472228","ALTERATION & RENOVATIONS SUMMARY In INBRE III, enhancement of infrastructure was achieved both through A&R funds and Administrative Core funds for instrumentation. For INBRE IV, there are acute needs for two of the primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), namely Chaminade University and UH Hilo Daniel K. Inouye College of Pharmacy (DKICP). Establishment and expansion of basic research infrastructure (instrumentation) and research faculty at Chaminade have created the immediate need for a BSL2-level laboratory suite, which will be key to raising the capability and capacity of their investigators to highly competitive level of sophisticated biomedical research. To eliminate this gap, renovations at Chaminade will convert a teaching laboratory and prep room in a two- room 944 sq. ft. BSL2 laboratory suite that incorporate a complement of previously purchased equipment for basic molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology research. At the DKICP, reorganization of the research facilities adjacent to the new permanent College of Pharmacy, which will house teaching and administration, necessitates the renovation of existing modular buildings to expand research space in order to accommodate consolidation of the active, productive research programs in Pharmaceutical Sciences. Renovation of the required space, over 8,500 sq. ft., will approach $4M. As an essential first stage in this renovation, one building will be converted from lecture halls to shared research laboratories, including an analytical laboratory with shared instruments, a solvent room and storage space with fume hood. DKICP proposes request of A&R funds for fixed equipment required for basic functioning of the shared laboratories, namely the fume hood as well as an emergency back-up generator. The A&R at Chaminade and at DKICP will have immediate impact on the research enterprise at each partner institution, not just upgrading the facilities but creating new capabilities and opportunities for investigators and students."
"9281579","Abstract  The centralization of data management and statistical analyses for multimodal imaging studies facilitates a consistent approach to the identification of biomarkers and mechanisms for disease. The first goal of the Biosta- tistics and Neuroinformatics (BNI) core is to provide a resource for investigators to develop consistent, robust statistical designs for testing the results against hypotheses, including developing statistical models for the output of new analysis algorithms or summary measures, and protecting against replication issues. The second goal is to provide a) a foundation for data management and integration across modalities, making it straightfor- ward to identify and retrieve specific scans, b) quality assurance measures, and c) clinical assessments for the same subject or subsets of subjects, while interacting flexibly with the advanced algorithms and methods from the other cores. This same infrastructure is used as an ongoing resource to share the data as well, publicizing the availability of the data and allowing the research community to request and download the data for re-use. These two goals interact in providing ongoing support in the development of new pilot projects as the COBRE progresses, and in providing training opportunities in biostatistical issues specific to these complex neuroimag- ing, longitudinal, data-fusion analyses. The long term goal of this core is to provide a powerful resource for data capture, sharing and dissemination, and in collaboration with the other COBRE cores, to support the develop- ment of a diversified neuroimaging research environment that will continue to be competitive nationally and in- ternationally. 2"
"9541933","PROJECT SUMMARY We are testing a novel strategy to regenerate damaged descending bulbospinal respiratory axons and reinnervate phrenic motor neurons (PhMN) after cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. SCI is caused by trauma to the spinal cord, and more than half of all cases occur in the cervical region, leading to breathing compromise by damaging circuits involved in respiratory control. Restoration of functional deficits caused by SCI is limited due to the low intrinsic drive of neurons to regenerate axons and a lack of guidance cues to signal growing axons to appropriate targets, among others. The C3-C5 mid-cervical spinal cord levels house the PhMNs, which are responsible for diaphragm activation. PhMNs are predominately mono-synaptically innervated by supraspinal respiratory neurons located in a brainstem nucleus called the rostral Ventral Respiratory Group (rVRG). We are seeking to reverse respiratory dysfunction after SCI by restoring the crucial circuit controlling PhMNs, and thus diaphragm activation. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors, promotes axonal growth and acts as a guidance cue. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is responsible for pro-growth pathways including axon growth. Downregulation of PTEN has been shown to induce axon regeneration. We aim to promote targeted reinnervation of PhMNs and restore diaphragm function by systemically inhibiting PTEN with antagonist peptides to induce axon growth through the injury, followed by BDNF overexpression selectively in PhMNs via an adeno-associated virus (AAV) to direct growing axons. In Aim 1, we will determine whether providing a PhMN-specific source of the axon guidance molecule, BDNF, promotes targeted PhMN reinnervation by rVRG axons following cervical SCI. We will assess rVRG axons using an AAV vector expressing a dual anterograde/trans-synaptic tracer, examining regrowth and collateral sprouting, and identify synaptic reconnection with spared PhMNs by post-synaptic accumulation of the trans-synaptic marker. In Aim 2, we will determine whether rVRG-PhMN circuit re-connectivity promotes diaphragmatic recovery after cervical SCI. We will assess the ability of rVRG-PhMN reconnection to restore diaphragm function by testing in vivo diaphragm activation via electromyography (EMG). Excitingly, we can distinguish between modes of recovery, i.e. ipsilateral regrowth versus contralateral sprouting, by selectively silencing unilateral rVRG neurons with inhibitory Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) and recording any subsequent changes in EMGs. BDNF overexpression is associated with neuropathic pain and abnormal motor function. We will test for unintended consequences of BDNF, including pain phenotypes and motor gains/deficits. We aim to use the strategy proposed here to reconnect motor neurons responsible for diaphragm activation with respiratory centers in the medulla to restore respiratory function following disruption after cervical SCI. The potential therapeutic benefits being explored will have profound implications for SCI patients suffering respiratory dysfunction."
"9519809","This grant application addresses a significant health problem - Alzheimer?s disease (AD) - that affects ~5.3 million people in the US and 20-30 million worldwide. As the population ages, these numbers are anticipated to rise, stimulating an intense search for disease prevention and treatment therapies as well as for biomarkers allowing early identification of AD. The latter is very important due to the existence of a long pre-symptomatic period that can be used for the initiation of prevention trials of disease-modifying therapies in asymptomatic individuals, with the goal of preventing cognitive decline as opposed to treating of symptoms that are already present.  The main goal of this study is to provide a groundwork for using the innovative MRI-based Gradient Echo Plural Contrast Imaging (GEPCI) technique for in vivo identifying early pathological changes in the AD brain. This technique, GEPCI, developed in our laboratory, provides surrogates for quantitative assessments of changes in the brain tissue structure at the cellular level and has been already successfully applied to evaluating tissue damage in multiple sclerosis and some psychiatric diseases.  Our preliminary data, obtained on well-characterized research participants recruited from studies of aging and dementia at the Washington University Knight Alzheimer?s Disease Research Center, allowed us to demonstrate for the first time that in vivo MRI-based measurements obtained on a clinical MRI scanner can provide information on brain amyloid-? accumulation in human participants, and to distinguish between healthy control, preclinical and mild AD stages. Based on these results, we plan to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1. Our Aim 1 is to develop a readily available, non-invasive quantitative in vivo MRI-based biomarker that can serve as a surrogate for amyloid-? accumulation in the brain (a primary role of A? in the development of Alzheimer's disease is now almost universally accepted). 2. Our Aim 2 is to establish specific quantitative and spatial patterns of GEPCI metrics abnormalities that would distinguish between normal brain, preclinical AD, and very mild AD. 3. Our Aim 3 is to establish the effect of early AD-related brain tissue damage (defined by GEPCI surrogate biomarkers) on cognitive performance and to test the hypothesis that the GEPCI metrics and/or changes in GEPCI metrics can be predictors of the disease progression. 4. Our Aim 4 is to validate GEPCI measurements against direct neuropathology.  The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish GEPCI as an in vivo non-invasive MRI technique available in a conventional clinical setting for screening population for preclinical AD pathology and clinical drug trials. GEPCI data are quantitative, reproducible and MRI scanner independent, thus allowing multi-center applications. The non-invasive nature of our approach is especially important since most of currently available biomarkers for identifying AD ?are invasive, to one degree or another (NIH PAR-15-359)?."
"9471415","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chemical processes that enable fragment union between functionalized coupling partners define a subset of reactions that are exceptionally powerful. While they can help to define efficient pathways to complex molecules, they are also of central importance to medicinal chemistry. Despite the importance of such reactions in chemical synthesis, it is surprising that only a handful of robust pathways are available for arguably the most relevant of such processes in natural product synthesis: intermolecular C-C bond formation between highly functionalized coupling partners. This research program is focused on establishing a new approach to stereoselective chemical synthesis that derives from design, discovery and development of new intermolecular C-C bond-forming reactions that proceed by metallacyclic intermediates, and establishing their utility in natural product synthesis Our initial phases of this program were heavily focused on methods development with recent efforts beginning to encompass the application of some of our coupling chemistry in natural product synthesis. Such latter study is critical for the evolution of new synthetic methods and the demonstration that they have a substantial impact on strategy and efficiency in a variety of target-oriented settings. To date, our efforts have established a foundation of new coupling technology that addresses structural motifs resident in a great variety of natural product targets (alkaloids, terpenes, and fatty acids), often doing so with exquisite levels of chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity.  As our program moves forward, we are committed to: (1) confirming the utility of metallacycle-mediated cross-coupling technology in complex molecule synthesis, (2) the establishment of new retrosynthetic strategies in target-oriented synthesis that emerge from our chemical methods, and (3) the first, or the most concise, syntheses of a range of natural products. In this way, our proposed studies will advance new modes of chemical reactivity to firmly establish a foundation of reaction methodology that has the potential to have a profound impact on target-oriented synthesis (at the strategic level). As such, continued development of this program promises the delivery of science that will have a significant impact on mankind's search for medicinally relevant small molecules and will enable scientific discovery at the interface of chemistry with biology and medicine."
"9459817","Core B Project Summary/Abstract There is a need for a Health span and Longevity Core to coordinate efforts of projects into a common goal to test the long term effects of SS-31 on age-related physiological function and lifespan in mice. These effects are not yet known at the multisystem level and the proposed experiments will shed new light on the ability to target mitochondria with a compound that is predicted to delay or reverse aging and age-related comorbid diseases. Use of a depot parenteral delivery will eliminate the need to do daily injections and provide a means of long term administration in preclinical studies and in human studies. The depot delivery concept is a significant approach to enhancing the value of the peptide. The underlying hypothesis is that SS-31 therapy initiated in middle age will forestall and protect the heart, skeletal muscle, vision and other health span metrics from intrinsic aging. It is not yet known whether SS-31 will extend lifespan (in any model organism) and this is a second important outcome of the efforts of Core B. Finally, application of a stressor can accelerate aging phenotypes, and the best model of this is a high fat diet (HFD), both because of its known deleterious effects on health span and lifespan metrics, as well as the unfortunate fact that obesity is epidemic in the human population. Thus, mice on a HFD model the aging of a large segment of humans. Specific Aim 1 will determine murine lifespan and health span after SS-31 is continuously delivered to mice beginning at middle age. Pilot data will confirm health span phenotypes in C57BL/6 and the F1 BALB/cBy x C57BL/6 hybrid, followed by full cross sectional and lifespan cohorts with both genders. Specific Aim 2 will determine the ability of SS-31 to attenuate the stress effects of a high fat diet (HFD) during aging. The protocol will follow that of Aim 1, but using a HFD. The data generated will provide valuable information on ways to further validate the peptide in preclinical studies and establish strategies for developing clinical anti-aging trials. Core B will address the resource objectives by providing colony management including old mouse monitoring and arrangements for colony management, and physiological assessment assays. Therefore, Core B will be enhancing the overall research goals of the P01."
"9447378","PROJECT SUMMARY Since the unexpected emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2013, the ongoing outbreaks of MERS in the Middle East and the potential for global transmission of MERS, exemplified by an outbreak in South Korea in 2015, have underscored the urgent need for effective preventive and therapeutic measures against this highly virulent coronavirus. MERS-CoV expresses two polyproteins that undergo proteolytic processing by two virus-encoded proteases, a 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and a papain-like protease, to generate functionally active proteins. MERS-CoV 3CLpro processes the majority of the cleavage sites on the polyproteins and is essential for viral replication, making it an attractive therapeutic target. A series of potent dipeptidyl inhibitors of the 3CLpro of coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV), a highly virulent feline coronavirus, have been generated. Using FIPV as a model, it was demonstrated that the lead compound for FIPV reverses the progression of fatal FIP in experimentally or naturally infected cats. Since FIP disease progression is quite rapid and its pathogenesis primarily immune- mediated, features shared by MERS-CoV, it was hypothesized that a viral protease inhibitor could reverse the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in affected hosts. Using a structure-guided approach, the anti-FIPV compound was structurally modified resulting in the identification of piperidine-derived lead compounds that were found to be highly effective against MERS-CoV. Thus, the primary goal of this R01 application is the identification of an in-vivo validated MERS-CoV preclinical candidate by conducting an array of basic and applied studies. Four aims are proposed to achieve this objective. Specific Aim 1. Optimize the piperidine-derived lead series of MERS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors by iterative medicinal chemistry and structure-based drug design. Specific Aim 2. Conduct in vitro efficacy, biochemical, mechanistic, structural, spectroscopic, and computational studies to prioritize analogs, elucidate the mechanism of action, and accelerate the optimization process. Specific Aim 3. Evaluate the physicochemical properties, ADMET, PK, and oral bioavailability of optimized leads. Specific Aim 4. Determine in vivo efficacy of optimized leads in mouse models of MERS-CoV infection. The ultimate long term goal of this program is the development of antiviral therapeutics for MERS by advancing a drug candidate through the stage of filing for an investigational new drug (IND) application."
"9475769","D. Abstract (Animal Models & Phenotyping Core) During the past 10 years (Y1-5 and Y6-10 of funding), the mandate of the Animal Models and Phenotyping Core (AMPC) was to make high quality transgenic and gene knockout mouse production and metabolic and behavioral phenotyping readily accessible, both technically and financially, to NORC members. The Animal Models and Phenotyping Core (AMPC) is comprised of two interactive components: the Animal Models Subcore and the Energy Metabolism and Behavioral Subcore. THE AMPC provides services that combined controlled manipulation of gene expression in mice with state-of-the-art in vivo metabolic phenotyping and detailed behavioral analysis. Over the past two funding cycles (Y1-5, Y6-10), the APMC has been a key component of the overall mission of the Pennington NORC to stimulate new and innovative research related to nutrition and obesity. The aims of the core are as follows: Aim 1: To utilize transgenic and gene targeting techniques to generate mouse models that mimic human disease states, such as obesity and insulin resistance, when exposed to an obeseogenic environment (sedentary lifestyle and high caloric diets). Aim 2: To conduct detailed in vivo metabolic phenotyping to assess measures of physiologic function such as, energy expenditure, fat accumulation, food intake, and metabolic flexibility. Aim 3: Conduct in vivo experiments for detailed analysis of animal behavior so as to support NORC members and the Pilot and Feasibility Program. Aim 4: Pursue new methods and experimental paradigms based on observations from NORC members and Pilot and Feasibility experiments. The above Aims will be performed using a combination of genetic and other in vivo approaches. Experiments in which the genetic constitution can be changed to study the role of specific genes on obesity and diabetes cannot be performed in humans. These studies will identify mechanisms that act on the progression of metabolic dysfunction (i.e., insulin resistance, ectopic fat deposition, metabolic inflexibility, pancreatic dysfunction, etc) by using rodent models that develop obesity and insulin resistance through direct genetic manipulation or exposure to high fat diets. Thus, through rigorous in vivo metabolic phenotyping in conjunction with detailed mechanistic analysis of relevant tissues by NORC investigators, the AMPC helps all NORC projects address the critical unanswered question of how an obesogenic environment affects normal metabolism at the whole body level."
"9433912","We propose that extracellular vesicles (EVs) can not only act as delivery vehicles for growth factors in therapeutic applications, but they also represent a novel growth factor signaling pathway to affect therapeutic outcomes. EVs are present throughout the body and are involved in intercellular communication, locally and systemically, from early development onward, and across physiological and pathophysiological conditions. EVs occur as soluble EVs in the extracellular microenvironment surrounding the cell and as solid-phase EVs immobilized within the extracellular matrix (ECM), thus creating EV/ECM microenvironments. EV cargo, such as growth factors, occur either on the EV surface or internalized within the EV lumen. Although growth factors on the surface of EVs appear to signal target cells via cell surface receptors, the signaling mechanisms of EV luminal confined growth factors remains unknown. We challenge long-held endocrine dogma arguing that growth factors, as proteins, must first bind to their surface receptors on target cells as a prerequisite to the initiation of intracellular signaling cascades. We hypothesize that EVs enveloping growth factor luminal cargo form EV/ECM microenvironments, bind to target cells and deliver growth factors directly into the cytoplasm via EV endocytic trafficking, bypassing growth factor cell surface receptors, representing the initiation of an alternative growth factor cell signaling pathway. Our preliminary studies involved loading BMP2 (as a prototypical growth factor) into EVs (BMP2-EVs) and then bioprinted them on ECM scaffolds to engineer BMP2-EV/ECM microenvironments. These BMP2-EV/ECM constructs delivered BMP2-EVs to cells, the BMP2-EVs were internalized, and they induced stem cell differentiation toward osteogenesis in vitro and heterotopic ossification in vivo. The mechanism of BMP2-EV signaling remains to be elucidated because binding to cell surface BMP2 receptors appeared to be bypassed. EV delivery of growth factors offer unique advantages beyond delivery based on ECM-immobilized BMP2 alone, including: protection from growth factor extracellular antagonists, such as noggin in the case of BMP2; synergistic effects of co-delivered native endogenous luminal co-cargo, such as miRNAs; and EV stability during processing and storage. In this R21 we will initiate studies to determine functioning of EV/ECM-delivered growth factors through the following complementary but independent specific aims: Aim 1, Initiate mechanistic studies toward understanding BMP2-EV/ECM signaling in vitro. Aim 2: Conduct animal experiments to determine the ability of implanted biopatterned BMP2-EV/ECM microenvironments to induce bone repair in our standard mouse calvarial critical- size defect (CSD) repair model."

To achieve these aims, in the next 5-year cycle (2014-2018) we will: (a) Collect data in person from the original NHATS cohort annually, including: continued collection of the enhanced disability protocol and supplemental questions on consequences including subjective and economic wellbeing, living and care arrangements, and quality of end of life; collection of dried blood spots, some to be assayed to foster study of the biologic risk for disability progression, and others to be stored for future use; enhancements to the NHATS interview in key understudied areas of potentially growing importance-use of rehabilitation services aimed at recovery from disability, and the service environment and related amenities that promote independent functioning in retirement and senior community settings-and incorporating new modules submitted by the broader research community. (b) Replenish the sample in Round 5 (2015). Replenishment will be implemented in such a way that NHATS maintains the ability to produce 5-year age estimates (including 90+) and Black-White comparisons. (c) Clean, document and disseminate public use files online and continue to make Medicare claims and other sensitive and restricted files available using established procedures. (d) Undertake methodological studies to improve the efficiency of data collection in future rounds, including testing the sensitivity of key estimates to differential follow-up periods and applying modern measurement approaches such as Item Response Theory (IRT) to measures of capacity. The overarching goal of NHATS is to be a platform for scientific inquiry to guide efforts to reduce disability, maximize functioning, and enhance older adults' quality of life. Research using NHATS will foster research to design multi-factor interventions to reduce late-life disability, and will support comprehensive modeling of outcomes of the disability process including living and care arrangements, expenditures, economic well-being, and quality of life."

The proposed MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) is a hybrid of the Mediterranean and DASH diets but with selected modifications based on the most compelling evidence in the diet-dementia field. The MIND diet has the same basic components of the DASH and Mediterranean diets, such as emphasis on natural plant-based foods and limited animal and high saturated fat foods, but uniquely specifies green leafy vegetables and berries as well as food component servings that reflect the nutrition-dementia evidence. There is a substantial body of evidence from epidemiological, animal and laboratory studies to link diet to brain health. Thus, the field is primed for the conduct of a large-scale prevention trial to establish a causal relation between diet and AD prevention. Establishing such a relation would greatly impact the public health and provide credibility to or refute numerous claims that various foods and dietary patterns are protective against AD. Dietary guidelines could be developed from the trial for use in clinical practice to inform patients about disease prevention. The proposed hybrid diet intervention has demonstrated effects on the prevention and treatment of most of the primary AD risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes, and the suppression of the two major underlying mechanisms of AD, oxidative stress and inflammation. The trial will employ a parallel group design comparing the effects on cognitive outcomes of the MIND intervention diet plus mild caloric restriction for weight loss to the control diet, usual diet with mild caloric restriction for weight loss. Biological effects of the MIND diet will be assessed by measurement of brain macro- and micro-structural integrity in 300 randomly selected participants. Other biochemical markers will be assessed in the entire cohort of 600 participants, including: plasma Abeta 42/Abeta 40, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and plasma markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, the trial will examine potential effect mediators and modifiers by a number of cardiovascular risk factors, AD biomarkers, and biological mechanisms. The proposed study has two clinical sites, one in Chicago (Rush University) and one in Boston (Harvard University), and centralized laboratories for data coordinating and analyses (Brigham & Women?s Hospital), neuroimaging analyses (Rush University), and specialized laboratories for tissue biochemical analyses."
"9459825","PROJECT 3: MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION AND VISION AGING - SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Progressive decline of visual function with age increases the susceptibility to social isolation and falls. It also leads to inactivity, which contributes to skeletal muscle weakness and wasting. The physiology of age-related visual impairment is not well understood, and there is no effective treatment. We have found that spatial visual function in C57BL/6 mice declines ~60% between 24 and 34 months, independent of optical changes in the eye, which is accompanied by mitochondrial abnormalities in photoreceptors, and disc pathology in outer segments. We have also found that feeding a high fat diet (HFD) to young mice leads to a more rapid decline of visual function, which was accompanied by mitochondrial abnormalities in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroidal vasculature. We hypothesized that impaired retinal mitochondrial energetics was the cause of age- and HFD-related visual decline. In support of this, we have found that the topical administration of the mito-protective peptide (SS-31) to the eye was able to reverse both age- and HFD-induced visual decline and its associated retinal pathology. Based on these and more recent preliminary results we now hypothesize that (1) age-related mitochondrial dysfunction in photoreceptors leads to visual decline; (2) HFD damages the choroidal vasculature resulting in ischemia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in the RPE; (3) Dietary excess will exacerbate age-related visual decline; (4) SS-31, by restoring mitochondrial structure and promoting bioenergetics in both photoreceptors and RPE, will ameliorate and even reverse visual decline caused by age and dietary excess; and (5) SS-31 exerts its anti-aging effects by promoting mitochondrial bioenergetics rather than simply scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). We will test these hypotheses in three aims: 1) Determine the mechanisms by which SS peptides reverse age- induced visual decline; 2) Determine the mechanisms of any interaction between age and HFD on visual decline, and whether treatment with SS-31 can reverse it; and 3) Establish the visual healthspan and aging benefits of SS-31 as a shared PO1 aim. Experiments will determine the degree to which oxidative stress, and bioenergetics failure, contribute to age- and HFD-related visual decline. They will also will evaluate a) cellular and mitochondrial structural changes in photoreceptors and RPE; b) changes in choroidal blood flow; c) mitochondrial function and oxidative stress in retina slices; c) oxidative changes to cytochrome c and electron transfer characteristics (with Core D); d) protein biomarkers for retinal blood flow, bioenergetics, oxidative stress, and inflammation; e) proteomic analyses of retinas (with Core C); and f) metabolomics for measuring redox state of retinas (with Core E). Finally, as part of a shared P01 aim to establish the translational benefits of SS-31, we will determine visual performance longitudinally over the mouse lifespan after SS-31 is continuously delivered from middle age to mice fed standard and high fat diets."
"9596895","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many leading human health organizations such as the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have declared that the increased prevalence of bacterial pathogens that are resistant to multiple antibiotics is a significant human health crisis. The emergence of these multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens is largely due to the sharing of resistance genes by plasmid mediated horizontal gene transfer. Bacterial plasmids are mobile genetic elements that can confer resistance to a variety of antibiotics, including those that are considered to be ?drugs of last resort?. Our long-term goal is to aid the development of strategies that can slow the spread of antibiotic resistance by gaining insight into the co-evolutionary processes that allow bacteria to improve the persistence of newly acquired MDR plasmids. Newly acquired resistance plasmids often do not persist in the absence of antibiotics, but we and others have shown that single mutations in the bacterial host, the plasmid, or both can rapidly improve this persistence. We and others also identified critical mutations in chromosomally encoded accessory helicases. Plasmid-helicase interactions in bacteria may therefore be key to the ability of bacterial pathogens to retain newly acquired MDR plasmids. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms that explain the positive effects of these mutations on plasmid persistence are unknown. Importantly, we also showed for the first time that these mutations pre-adapt the bacteria to other MDR plasmids that they acquire later in time, leading to their enhanced persistence (referred to as increased plasmid permissiveness). This suggests that bacteria with increased permissiveness can serve as stable repositories for multiple MDR plasmids, eventually generating strains with an expanded arsenal of resistance genes. This possibility has never been tested. Using molecular techniques, experimental evolution and mathematical modeling, we propose to test the following hypotheses: (i) chromosomal mutations can pre- adapt bacteria to other plasmids, leading to greater plasmid permissiveness; (ii) plasmid permissiveness can expand the spectrum of antibiotic resistance traits within a bacterial species; and (iii) accessory helicases are linked to the persistence of newly acquired MDR plasmids across a wide spectrum of bacterial pathogens. This will be done through achieving the following Specific Aims: (1) Test the generality of (i) increased plasmid permissiveness after host/plasmid coevolution, and (ii) helicase mutations as a mechanism of host adaptation to novel MDR plasmids.; (2) determine the effects of plasmid persistence and permissiveness on the emergence of expanded drug resistance; (3) determine the molecular mechanism of plasmid cost amelioration resulting from mutations in accessory helicases. If our hypotheses are supported by our data, mutations that stabilize one plasmid could lead to improved persistence of other plasmids, and expand the arsenal of resistance genes in the same cell. Our findings will aid the development of new therapies aimed at slowing down the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens.!"
"9687249","ABSTRACT There is limited pathogenic understanding and no cure for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ~200 RA-associated loci. These loci represent ~4573 genetic variants, which in most cases is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in linkage disequilibrium (LD). In theory, there is only one functional SNP (fSNP) in each LD that is responsible for the pathogenesis of RA. However, GWAS don't reveal which one is the fSNP in each LD. This technical drawback leaves a gap between GWAS and a specific mechanism that would provide into opportunities for biological insight and therapeutic intervention. To overcome this limitation, we have developed two novel techniques: functional Single Nucleotide Polymorphism-next generation sequencing (fSNP-seq) and DNA competition pulldown-mass spectrometry (DCP-MS). fSNP-seq is a high throughput method to identify experimentally which SNPs are likely to bind regulatory proteins and thus to likely be fSNPs. DCP-MS uses an fSNP sequence as ?bait? to identify associated regulatory proteins in a semi-high throughput way. Using these techniques in a pilot screen, we have identified three fSNPs on a RA-associated CD40 locus that have been confirmed by EMSA and an allele-specific luciferase reporter assay. We have also identified four proteins that regulate CD40 expression via these fSNPs. On the basis of these preliminary data, we propose two aims to apply our new methods to the GWAS data on RA. First, we will use fSNP-seq to screen 1218 SNPs for fSNPs on 101 RA risk loci revealed by a recent study. However, due to the high level of effort involved in this process, we will limit the identification and characterization of fSNPs to only seven RA risk loci involved in the CD40/NF-kB pathway. Second, we will employ DCP-MS to screen for the RA risk gene regulators on the validated fSNPs in these seven RA risk loci in the CD40/NF-kB pathway. This methodology  could lead to building a sustainable, long-term research program t o apply this strategy to the entire RA loci. The long-term goal would be to identify the best drug targets for developing personalized drugs in a context of the entire RA-associated risk gene regulation network."
"9603950","New direct-acting antivirals against hepatitis C virus (HCV) cure the virus in most patients. However, these compounds are expensive and not available to most of the 170 million people that are worldwide infected with HCV. There are also no approved vaccines or anti-viral compounds for other members of the flaviviridae, such as Dengue virus, West Nile virus or Zika virus. Thus, identification of cellular genes that are essential for virus propagation is highly significant, because such targets are not regulated by the error-prone viral RNA polymerase and, therefore, offer a high barrier to resistance. The long-term goal of this application is to explore the mechanism by which certain noncoding RNAs, such as microRNAs and circular RNAs, display pro-viral or anti-viral activities. It is known that microRNA miR-122 attaches as an oligomeric complex to the 5? end of the viral genome and protects it from degradation by host exonucleases. Curiously, escape mutants that harbor a single C3U mutation in the viral genome were detected in the serum of 122-antagomir treated patients. The overall objective of the first aim to is identify interactions of between C3U HCV genome with nucleic acids or proteins that allow the virus to persist when miR-122 abundance is reduced. The central hypothesis is that novel RNA-RNA or protein RNA interactions in the C3U HCV genome allow stabilization and expression of the viral genome in the cells during reduced miR-122 abundances. Novel cell-based protein biotinylation assays and approaches that detect tertiary RNA structures will be used to study RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions in wildtype and mutant viral RNAs in cultured liver cells. Steps in the viral life cycle that are modulated by such nucleic acid-protein interactions will be identified. The overall objective of the second aim is based upon the finding that the host cell-derived circular RNA (cRNAs) landscape is altered during HCV infection. The potential mechanisms by which cRNAs exert their pro- and antiviral functions will be explored. First, effects of cRNA-mediated sequestration of proteins and microRNAs on HCV RNA amplification will be examined. Because methylation of specific adenosines in cRNAs has been shown to induce translation initiation in cRNAs, the methylation status in cRNAs will be determined. The properties of methylated cRNAs to synthesize small peptides will be examined using genetic and proteomic approaches. Overall, the application details innovative paradigm-shifting concepts to study roles for noncoding RNAs in virus-host interactions, using novel detection methodologies. The rationale for this proposal is that noncoding RNAs, such as microRNAs and cRNAs, affect HCV pathogenesis. It has been shown that microRNAs can be targeted in HCV patients, resulting in loss of viral RNA abundance. Thus, targeting pro-viral cRNAs in the liver offers a novel antiviral strategy."
"9453317","PROJECT SUMMARY Hemophilia A and B are monogenic disorders characterized by the loss of factor VIII (F8) or factor IX (F9) leading to delayed blood clotting and life-long treatment with recombinant clotting factors or blood products. Gene therapy has held promise for treating monogenetic diseases like hemophilia, however, has yet to deliver a curative treatment. Gene delivery barriers and the potential requirement of costly repetitive treatments characterize the drawbacks of technologies currently in the therapeutic pipeline. Gene editing has emerged as a method to make permanent modifications to the host genome. Specifically, RNA-guided nucleases (RGNs) have the potential to correct the genetic basis of a broad range of diseases including hemophilia. However, significant delivery barriers of RGNs or gene-encoded RGNs hinder in vivo gene editing. To date, the most reported in vivo gene editing approaches have used viral delivery vehicles due to robust expression and available tissue tropism. An exciting alternative is the generation of effective non-viral delivery vehicles for RGNs that address the safety concerns of viral delivery vehicles. Therefore, the overall goal of this work is to create a powerful biomacromolecule delivery vector for genome-editing technologies. The central hypothesis of this work is that non-viral delivery of gene-editing nucleases can precisely target replacement genes to safe-harbor loci in the human genome and restore protein expression in hemophilia A or B. The hypothesis will be evaluated with the following specific aims: 1) Characterize viral and non-viral gene replacement safety and efficacy in murine liver. 2) Apply viral and non-viral gene replacement in mouse models of hemophilia, and 3) Develop a screening platform for non-viral gene delivery vehicles. In Aim 1, intravenous delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 will be evaluated for efficient gene replacement. Promising preliminary data for gene delivery to liver has been demonstrated by the PI for viral and non-viral delivery. Both viral and non-viral delivery strategies will be pursued in parallel. Quantitative readouts for single base pair changes, small insertions, and large insertions will be used to assess the efficacy of the delivery routes and determine immune response and off-target activity. In Aim 2, mouse models of hemophilia will be evaluated for genomic modification and recovery of the absent clotting factor. Factor VIII is a model of a large insertion and FIX is a model of a small insertion. In Aim 3, we propose to combine deep sequencing with gene editing to screen libraries of non-viral compounds in small numbers of animals. This method overcomes the limitations of high-throughput in vitro screens that cannot recapitulate complex in vivo delivery barriers. The end result of this work will be an efficient non-viral gene editing toolbox for targeted gene replacement. In addition, this work will generate new strategies for gene editing and gene therapy to improve clinical treatment of hemophilia which may be applied to other genetic diseases."
"9474598","PROJECT SUMMARY This K23 application is submitted by Grace Richter, MD, MPH, an Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology in the Glaucoma Division at the USC Roski Eye Institute at Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the additional training and mentored research experience necessary to direct clinical studies independently; and 2) to perform cross-sectional research investigating the relationships of various retinal microcirculation perfusion parameters with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), systemic vascular disease, and ocular anatomic factors in African Americans, who have a greater burden of POAG compared to other populations. Together, this will provide the foundation for me to establish an independent clinical research program using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to study factors that affect OBF and to elucidate how OBF affects glaucoma in an R01-sponsored longitudinal clinical study. While I already have a Masters in Public Health (MPH), this K23 training program will provide additional necessary training for this research. My training efforts will focus on four areas: (1) vessel quantification methods using OCTA; (2) methods in population-based and clinical cohort studies; (3) advanced biostatistical methods for epidemiology and clinical research; and (4) best research practices in diverse populations. In addition to formal coursework, training will be greatly enhanced by regular meetings with renowned mentors (Dr. Rohit Varma, Dr. Ruikang Wang, Dr. James Gauderman, and Dr. Roberta McKean-Cowdin), as well as participation in local and international meetings. This research proposal will utilize OCTA data collected on participants of the African American Eye Disease Study to define the relationships of 4 different measures of retinal perfusion with: (1) glaucoma, including both structural and functional measures; (2) systemic vascular diseases including diabetes and hypertension; and (3) ocular anatomic features including intraocular pressure, central corneal thickness, and axial myopia in glaucoma and non-glaucoma patients. These systemic and ocular factors are thought to be risk factors for glaucoma, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Defining the relationships of these entities with retinal perfusion parameters will give us better insight into the pathogenesis of glaucoma and will generate improved hypotheses for glaucoma pathophysiology. This research will provide key data for subsequent longitudinal studies and generate refined hypotheses for possible interventional studies. Ultimately, it will lead to improved treatments that prevent blindness from glaucoma."

"9475766","B. Abstract (Administrative Core) The Pennington Biomedical (PBRC) Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NORC) was initially established more than 9 years ago to facilitate and promote collaborative and multi-disciplinary interactions to foster new research ideas and enhance the translation of basic nutritional research findings into the clinical arena and ultimately into practical application. In agreement with the reviewers' feedback, we have now expanded from our original theme of ?nutritional programing? to emphasize the more general theme of ?nutrition, obesity and metabolic health through the lifespan?. Like most of the NIDDK NORCs, our research base is related to the metabolic consequences of nutrition on health and diseases. We now plan to address big research questions in obesity and nutrition from the basic science level, to clinical investigation and finally to the population in a translational way. Our overall aim is to focus on the mechanisms involved in health and disease, the study of treatment intervention and the implementation of preventive strategies. The long standing tradition of nutrition and obesity research at PBRC provides an ideal academic environment to undertake interdisciplinary efforts to investigate the environmental and molecular interactions underlying health and disease. With our past 5 years extension of resources (faculty, clinical space, equipment, and support personnel), and an established cadre of outstanding scientists, a Pennington NORC catalyzes novel nutrition and obesity research around the targeted theme. Besides an Administrative Core which provides the administrative infrastructure that will facilitate successful completion of Aims for all Cores, the NORC encompasses 3 scientific cores.  1) The ?Human Phenotyping Core? aims to: provide a comprehensive suite of innovative energy balance  and behavioral services in clinical and translational research studies; provide specialist expertise to  members; administer a human tissue bio-repository and; expand our fMRI capabilities. 2) The ?Animal Models and Phenotyping Core? provides the required animal models including conditional  transgenic or knockout animals and state of the art phenotyping especially in energy balance studies. 3) The ?Molecular Mechanisms Core? offers technologies to discover changes to the epigenome, and measure altered gene expression (i) on the functional genomics and systems biology level by profiling RNA expression, (ii) on the level of tissues and cells by quantitative bioimaging technology to detect where gene expression is affected. A novel development is the analyses of gut microbiome using 16S rRNA metagenomics sequencing. Every year, the NORC also provides support for 2-4 Pilot & Feasibility grants and an Enrichment Program. With an exceptional institutional support, an ideal academic environment and now collaboration with other academic institutions in Louisiana, Pennington has established a strong base of obesity/nutrition research and is now poised to grow in the theme of ?nutrition, obesity and metabolic health through the lifespan?."
"9493497","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-range goal of the proposed studies is to determine the functions of long non-coding RNAs in vertebrate development. The past decade has seen an explosion of genome-wide studies that have identified a plethora of previously unannotated transcripts. Among these novel transcripts, the class of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has attracted particular attention since they represent an extensive, largely unexplored component of the genome: the dark matter of the genome. The proposed study aims to perform a reverse genetic screen and analyze the function of 100 lncRNAs in zebrafish. Genomics and computational approaches have led to the identification of several hundred lncRNAs expressed during zebrafish development. 100 of these lncRNAs, selected by conservation, genomic location, expression, and chromatin profile, will be disrupted. Antisense oligonucleotides will be used to directly interfere with lncRNAs, and site-specific endonucleases (TALENs and CRISPRs) will be employed to disrupt lncRNA genes. Embryos and larvae will then undergo systematic phenotypic characterization to reveal the functions of lncRNAs. The proposed reverse genetic screen will provide the first comprehensive analysis of vertebrate lncRNA function in vivo and generate the resources for the field to reveal the roles of this mysterious class of molecules."

"9575327","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chlamydia trachomatis genital infection is the most commonly reported infectious disease in the United States with no vaccine available. The rational design of a chlamydia vaccine requires improved understanding of the protective immune mechanisms within the female reproductive tract (FRT) mucosa. Although it is broadly accepted that CD4 T cells play a predominant role in protective immunity against Chlamydia FRT infection, the mechanisms underlying CD4 T cell-mediated immune protection remain to be poorly understood. This application proposes to develop a thorough understanding of the differentiation, anatomical distribution and maintenance of protective memory CD4 T cells and how they are stimulated to confer protective immunity against Chlamydia. We recently generated several Chlamydia-specific MHC Class II tetramers, which allow for the first time direct visualization of endogenous, antigen-specific CD4 T cells following Chlamydia FRT infection. Using these unique tools, we specifically propose to (i) examine the protective antigen-specific memory CD4 T cell responses that lead to fast Chlamydia clearance from the FRT, and (ii) identify the major antigen-presenting cells that stimulate the rapid protective memory CD4 T cell response in the FRT. We anticipate that identifying the protective aspects of memory CD4 T cell responses to Chlamydia reinfection and elucidating how immunological memory is maintained and reactivated in the host will provide important insights into the future design of an urgently needed chlamydia vaccine."
"9476966","Project Summary/Abstract  The liver is a major metabolic organ responsible for maintaining whole-body homeostasis in a changing  environment. Given the worldwide use of alcohol, the epidemic of obesity and viral infection, liver damage is  common in clinical practice. The molecular mechanisms that control the balance between hepatocyte life and  death in response to chronic liver injury remain largely elusive. O-linked ?-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc)  modification has emerged as an important regulatory mechanism underlying normal liver physiology and  metabolic disease. This prevalent and dynamic post-translational modification is controlled by O-GlcNAc  transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). We recently found that liver-specific OGT knockout mice develop  hepatomegaly, ballooning degeneration, and fibrosis in the liver. We therefore hypothesize that OGT acts as a  critical molecular switch between hepatocyte survival and death in response to chronic liver injury. To  test this hypothesis, we propose to undertake three specific aims. Aim 1 will define the role of OGT in  pathogenesis of liver injury; Aim 2 will identify the critical targets of OGT in hepatocyte survival and death; Aim  3 will determine the functional importance of OGT regulation of necroptosis in liver injury. Successful  completion of this project will provide critical insights into the role of OGT in regulating the balance between  hepatocyte survival and death and the onset of liver injury. Detailed investigation of liver-specific OGT  knockout mice will likely establish a useful mouse model that recapitulates features of human liver injury, and  facilitate therapeutic target identification for prevention and treatment of chronic liver disease."
"9471764","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Why do we age, and why do some individuals age faster than others? Genetic studies have found many genes that can extend lifespan in laboratory populations. However, these genes explain little of the substantial genetic variation in lifespan that we observe in natural populations, including humans. Environmental studies have found that diet restriction (DR) can extend lifespan, and that this effect is highly conserved across taxa. However, within populations, the DR response shows considerable genetic variation. As with lifespan, the pathways that account for this genetic variation in the DR response are also unknown. Our overarching goal is to understand the genetic pathways, functional mechanisms and selective forces that shape this natural variation in aging. Towards this end, we have gathered three important sets of preliminary data. First, we have found that sex, diet, tissue type, genotype, and age all have substantial effects on the fruit fly metabolome. Second, diet restriction, which can extend mean lifespan, leads to a dramatic reversal of the effect of age on the metabolome, and this reversal appears to be associated with glycogen, glucose, and tryptophan metabolism. Third, diet restriction extends lifespan in some genotypes, while in others there is no response at all. Based on these data, we hypothesize that genetic and environmental factors that extend lifespan do so predominantly by slowing age-related changes in metabolic pathways, and that variation in these pathways will allow us to a) predict the longevity of a genotype; b) predict whether lifespan in a given genotype will respond to DR; and c) discover the mechanisms through which DR extends lifespan. Specifically, we hypothesize that DR will extend lifespan by slowing age-related changes in the same molecular pathways that account for natural variation in longevity. We will test our hypotheses by genetically mapping the metabolome in a population that shows significant variation in rates of aging, and by identifying the causal metabolic pathways that determine how individual genotypes respond to DR. Finally, we will take advantage of the power of fly genetics to manipulate metabolite levels and gene expression in flies. These manipulations will allow us to test specific mechanistic hypotheses that arise from our preliminary studies and from results generated by the work proposed here. This innovative approach combines highly sensitive metabolomic profiling with both quantitative and molecular genetics in an easily manipulated model organism, allowing us to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie natural variation for aging and aging-related perturbations at an unprecedented scale and level of detail. This work is expected to provide critical insights into the functional mechanisms by which well-studied factors increase lifespan, and to lead to a clearer understanding of how variation in fitness traits is generated and maintained in natural populations. The metabolomic profiling proposed here can also be carried out easily in human populations, and as such, our approach has the long- term potential to reveal the molecular pathways associated with aging and age-related disease in humans."
"9596207","ABSTRACT There has been tremendous progress in DNA sequencing technology to decrease cost and increase capacity, yet technologies for proteomics have not advanced much in the last 30 to 40 years. While a number of approaches for generating recombinant affinity reagents exist, the cost and throughput of current technologies represent significant roadblocks to the development of a comprehensive and broadly available resource of renewable affinity reagents. We propose to develop a technology that will allow us to screen a library of M13 phage displaying >1010 different antibodies against a library of >104 different protein (and/or peptide) antigens displayed on an E. coli cell surface. The F-pilus is the attachment site for M13 infection of E. coli. In the proposed technology, phage infection of the cells relies on the interaction of an M13-displayed antibody and the bacterial cell surface-displayed antigen of a transiently-F-minus E. coli host in water-in-oil emulsions. NextGeneration DNA sequencing and a multiplex barcoding scheme will be used to identify antibody:antigen pairs. We will use a set of high-value, immuno-oncology targets to develop the method and compare to antibodies obtained with more traditional phage display biopanning techniques. The technology itself should be applicable to any organism, including viral, bacterial and human proteomes, as well as single- and mixed-populations of proteomes."
"9461043","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic inflammatory diseases such as periodontal disease are greatly exacerbated in diabetic patients (Wang and Kaltenboeck, 2010). The mechanism of the acceleration of periodontitis remains unknown, however, diabetes and periodontitis both activate the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-B. Upon stimulation, NF-?B recruits other proteins such as modification enzymes. Modification enzymes alter the chromatin structure via histone modification mechanisms ultimately regulating transcription. In the present study, we will examine histone methylation of gene promoters concomitantly expressed in high glucose conditions (diabetes) and under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge (periodontitis). Microarray gene expression analysis from our preliminary study revealed that periopathic LPS challenge affects three groups of NF-kB target genes corresponding to unique histone methylation signature: (i) immediate-early response genes associated with cell recruitment such as CCL2, CXCL1,and IL-6 which demonstrated active H3K4me3 methylation (ii) late response genes associated with cell activation and defense mechanisms such as IL-1ß, TNF-?, and several defensins that featured repressive H3K9me3 and/or H3K27me3 methylation and (iii) matrix-related genes involved in bone and connective tissue metabolism such as collagens I and III, MMP2 and 9, and RANKL were occupied by both active and repressive trimethylation marks. We propose that long-term inflammation severely alters the methylation state of these periodontal connective tissues which diminishes its ability to function normally and results in chronic periodontitis. We thus hypothesize that in response to periopathic LPS challenge and high glucose conditions, NF-kB avails itself of the histone methylation machinery, resulting in upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and dysregulation of matrix-related genes, linked to exacerbated periodontitis under diabetic conditions. We have therefore developed a research plan to (1) identify gene expression and epigenetic histone methylation patterns in the aforementioned groups of NF-kB target genes during the progression of periodontitis, (2) to determine the role of NF-?B and chromatin modifications in the exacerbated periodontal phenotype of diabetic animals, and (3) identify the relationship between NF-?B signaling, chromatin structure and histone methylation. Together, these experiments will provide epigenetic information about functional links between diabetes and periodontitis which may result in improvements in therapeutic strategies for periodontitis under diabetic conditions."
"9534096","Uncoordinated or unwanted generation of nerve impulses is a major disabling factor in many medical conditions. These can affect motor, sensory, and autonomic nerves. Many of these pathological conditions could be ameliorated by interrupting these abnormal impulses in the periphery. The accepted methods of inhibiting neural activity are typically pharmacological (local anesthetics, channel blockers, etc.) or surgical (denervation). Electrical nerve block has been proposed and evaluated as a means of providing real-time rapidly acting and rapidly reversing nerve block and is a potential candidate for inducing a reliable, rapid, gradable and reversible nerve block. We have been investigating two types of electrical nerve block; KiloHertz Frequency Alternating Current (KHFAC) and Charge Balance Polarizing Current (CBPC) nerve block for clinical applications.  KHFAC produces a rapid and reversible block. However, it has an important side effect. It produces an onset response when first initiated. This onset response is a brief rapid activation of the nerve and is a detriment to generalized clinical applications. CBPC block does not produce an onset response but can only be applied up to 10 seconds at a time with a low duty cycle. We have combined the positive aspects of the two methods of electrical nerve block into a single waveform (Combined No Onset Waveform or CNOW). We propose to investigate and optimize the design of the CNOW through computer simulations, hardware design and animal experiments to finalize a reliable method of applying KHFAC nerve block, without an onset response, in a variety of clinically relevant peripheral nerves."
"9484382","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV-1 is an utmost critical goal towards the development of a protective AIDS vaccine. In this R21 proposal, we will explore the feasibility of developing novel immunogens and evaluate its ability to prime antibody responses towards the neutralizing epitope targeted by a bnAb 10E8 on the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of HIV-1 gp41. 10E8 has been shown to neutralize ~98% of all HIV-1 isolates tested. Thus, our proposal to develop an immunogen that could lead to induction of 10E8-like bnAbs is highly significant. This proposal is based on the scientific premise that a priming immunogen (primogen) plays a critical role in generating a B-cell repertoire that will determine antibody responses during subsequent exposures to boosting immunogens. As such, developing a primogen that can induce antibodies directed predominantly against the 10E8 neutralizing epitope is of paramount importance. The major innovation and the focus of this proposal is HM6HB immunogen. It is comprised of a modified heptad repeat region 1 (HR1) and the MPER of gp41. It is predicted to form a stable six-helix bundle (6HB) structure. The primary objective of this proposal is to generate a lumazine synthase nanoparticle-based immunogen (HM6HB-LS) that could be used as a primogen to focus antibody responses towards the 10E8 neutralizing epitope. Successful completion of this study would overcome a critical roadblock towards development of a protective AIDS vaccine."
"9624124","The Institutional Career Development (KL2) core proposes an innovative, flexible program to prepare a cadre of experts in clinical and translational (C/T) research to address the lack of optimal management strategies for hundreds of diseases and conditions and for special approaches across the entire population, including special and vulnerable populations of all ages. The KL2 program seeks support for an educational curriculum designed to meet the special needs of emerging, talented investigators across all disciplines. This program is designed to adapt to the individual needs of each scholar and build upon and improve the CTSC's existing highly successful program to address unmet educational and career development needs of clinical research scholars of all professions in the rapidly evolving field of C/T science. Unmet needs will be addressed by educating leaders in multidisciplinary clinical and translational research, introducing clinical research education earlier in the life cycle of scholars from diverse disciplines (nursing, bioinformatics, social work, engineering, pharmacology, psychology, etc.), tailoring programs to the preferences, special interests, research plans, strengths, and weaknesses of each scholar with appropriate modifications, as required, for each discipline, and setting the standards and developing innovative approaches to C/T career development. The program builds on lessons learned from prior experience in operating a highly successful KL2 program, proven strategies from published national studies on mentorship, collaboration with other CTSA Hub KL2 sites, new and innovative programs to re-enforce the strengths of scholars in a broad and deep spectrum of capabilities, and a robust education and career development program that utilizes all resources within the CTSC and synergizes with the TL1 pre-doctoral and postdoctoral programs. The KL2 Career Development program aims to 1) further enrich and expand integrated CTSC-wide innovative and individually tailored KL2 program, 2) prepare the next generation of investigators with the multidisciplinary skills required to lead cutting-edge C/T research and meet the opportunities and challenges of medicine in the 21st Century, and 3) build the multidisciplinary workforce of the future. The highly adaptive KL2 program focuses on addressing the individual gaps in knowledge and skill of each scholar. The current program benefits from a cross-institutional, cross-disciplinary C/T research career development program, which, in turn, derived from the successful introduction of the Roadmap K12 multidisciplinary C/T research program launched in 2004. As the program was re-designed, best practices were kept from earlier iterations, what was learned from scholar feedback was incorporated, available institutional resources carefully considered, and attention paid to desired outcomes (what was accomplished and who was reached), results (short, intermediate and long term), published literature and the overall impact of the entire program."
"9541858","PROJECT SUMMARY  Age-related hearing loss (ARHL)- clinically referred to as presbycusis, is the leading neurodegenerative disorder, the number one communication problem, and one of the top three chronic medical conditions in the aged population. The long-term goal of this proposal seeks to assess the efficacy of two innovative therapies to combat ARHL: (1) systemic treatment with omega-3 essential fatty acids paired with aldosterone and (2) exposure augmented acoustic environment. Treatment efficacy will be evaluated by monitoring sensory (cochlea) and neural (brain) circuitry, as well as changes in molecular and structural biomarkers associated with ARHL. There are 2 Specific Aims in this proposal: Specific Aim 1. Determine the therapeutic effects of omega-3 essential fatty acids on the aging auditory system. Aging mice will be fed a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids (n-3), and neural and molecular metrics will be measured, along with behavioral, physiological, and anatomical indices. Positive results would allow us to look toward pairing n-3 with aldosterone, a hormone that has shown promise in halting age-related hearing loss in animal studies at the Global Center for Hearing and Speech Research (GCHSR). Specific Aim 2. Determine the ability of augmented acoustic environments to arrest or prevent salient features of presbycusis. Enriched acoustic environments will consist of extended, controlled exposure to specific artificially generated sounds presented in free field in the animal holding environment (vivarium). Outcome measures will index peripheral and central components of ARHL at systems, cellular, and molecular levels.  The multidisciplinary team at the GCHSR is making significant strides toward translational advances in the treatment of presbycusis in older listeners. This work is relevant because it will lead to a better understanding of how the aging process affects the auditory system and will pave the way for unique pharmaceutical and technological interventions that prevent, slow down, or reverse this pervasive age-related medical condition."
"9475717","Project Summary/Abstract The Getting Active Project (GAP). The many negative outcomes associated with loneliness in older people have rendered loneliness itself a new public health target. Older adults who feel lonely carry increased risk for reduced quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. The risk of premature mortality related to loneliness is at least as large as the risks arising from such factors as obesity, physical inactivity, alcohol misuse, and smoking. Volunteering is a promising intervention for reducing loneliness in later life. The primary objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that a social volunteering program for lonely older adults will lead to reduced loneliness and improved quality of life. National infrastructure for volunteering (The Senior Corps) ensures that volunteering is a highly scalable intervention. We propose to compare the effect of a Senior Corps volunteering intervention versus a self-guided life review active control condition on feelings of loneliness in older adults. Our preliminary data, as well as published studies of volunteering in later life, strongly suggest that volunteering (but not life review) should reduce loneliness. Rigorous experimental study is needed, however, to examine volunteering in both men and women who are lonely, to determine conditions that maximize benefit, and to understand mechanisms. We hypothesize, per tenets of Self-Determination Theory, that increased social engagement and feelings of both usefulness and social support function as psychological mechanisms whereby volunteering reduces loneliness. Understanding these mechanisms will promote effective implementation, allowing communities to adapt volunteering programs while retaining the active ingredients. We will randomly assign older adults (150 women, 150 men) who report loneliness to 12 months of either: 1) a structured social volunteering program providing peer companionship to frail, homebound older adults for at least 4 hours per week, or 2) an active control intervention with self-guided life review. Our aims are as follows: 1) To examine the effect of volunteering on loneliness and quality of life; 2) To examine social engagement, perceived usefulness, and social support as mechanisms for reducing loneliness; 3) To examine conditions under which volunteering is most effective at reducing loneliness. Our intervention is already implemented nation-wide, indicating high feasibility of going to scale (http://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/senior-corps). If effective, volunteering should be ?prescribed? by physicians and promoted by policy. Dissemination and scaling up efforts will involve connecting primary care patients and aging services clients who are lonely with The Senior Corps, which we have shown to be feasible in our companion study, The Senior Connection. Existing infrastructure will make it possible to reach a large proportion of lonely older adults. Reducing loneliness has the potential to improve well-being and save lives. Van Orden"
"9499502","PROJECT SUMMARY Recent work suggests that up to 2% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) have deletions or point mutations in the SHANK3 gene, resulting in Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), and approximately 85% of people with PMS meet criteria for ASD. SHANK3 codes for a master scaffolding protein that forms a key framework in the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic (excitatory) synapses and plays a critical role in synaptic function. SHANK3 and glutamate pathways are implicated in multiple forms of ASD and this convergence implies shared biochemical pathways with potentially overlapping therapeutic targets. Thus, targeting SHANK3 deficiency in PMS as a specific genetic cause of ASD allows us to inform treatment in broader idiopathic ASD (iASD). Our ongoing studies provide in-depth phenotyping of PMS, pointing toward a specific clinical and electrophysiological (EEG) profile. However, the efficacy of potential EEG biomarkers as a measure of treatment response remains to be determined.  Preliminary data using visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to examine cortical excitatory postsynaptic potentials demonstrate promising links to disease mechanisms in PMS and iASD. Biomarkers and novel clinical measures for evaluating response to intervention have also been piloted successfully at our site in cohorts of patients with PMS and iASD. We have identified a unique VEP profile of excitatory deficits in PMS (markedly reduced P60-N75 amplitude) that is also present in a subset of children with iASD. Here, we propose to extend this work to a larger sample in PMS and to parallel excitatory processes in the auditory domain, in order to stratify individuals with iASD and select those we predict will show response to IGF-1.  We will enroll 150 children (60 PMS; 90 iASD; age 5-12 years), specifically recruiting intellectually disabled and minimally verbal children given the prominence of this profile in PMS and the critical need to address this group in broader ASD research. Our short-term goal is to show that select electrophysiological markers in PMS are relevant to iASD and predictive of treatment response. Our long-term goal is to optimize treatment selection in iASD by establishing biological signature(s) derived from PMS that are: a) useful for predicting treatment responders, and b) responsive to intervention. The expected outcome of this study is to establish the feasibility of electrophysiological biomarkers for use in clinical trials in PMS and iASD and to define a biological profile that will mark a subset of patients with iASD likely to show neural and clinical response to IGF-1."

The variety and capacity of the partner institutions located throughout the islands of Hawaii require a strong Administrative Core to coordinate these activities and synergize the efforts of those involved, including the campus coordinators, core directors, faculty, mentors, and students. The major activities coordinated through the Administrative Core involve the development of research faculty and implementation of high caliber research, facilitation of student education and skills training, organizing workshop and enrichment activities for faculty/staff and students, and conducting program evaluation. In addition, the Administrative Core will work closely with the Bioinformatics Core for optimizing their efforts and expansion throughout the HiSREP. The Administrative Core will be led by Principal Investigator (PI), Robert Nichols, Ph.D., along with the Program Coordinator (PC), Peter Hoffmann, Ph.D. The PI will provide overall direction and general administrative support for the entire HiSREP program. The PC will assist the PI with all activities and will assume primary responsibility for communicating and coordinating activities among partner institutions. The Administrative Core will foster collaborative interactions among partners and serve as a cohesive link between cores and activities. The PI and PC, along with a strong administrative support staff, will receive guidance and evaluation by an Internal Executive Committee (IEC), a Steering Committee, an External Advisory Committee (EAC), and an Evaluation team. The PI and PC will also serve to liaise with INBREs from other states to discuss approaches and strategies so that the Hawaii INBRE can improve its programs based on the experiences of these other networks. Through effective planning and implementation, the Administrative Core will greatly expand research capacity at our HiSREP partner institutions, increase the number and quality of biomedical scientists, provide research education opportunities for students at all stages to inspire them to pursue research in the health sciences, and provide a state-of-the-art bioinformatics facility to support our Hawaii community of scientists."
"9507747","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spatial memory impairment and disorientation are a common problem associated with aging and they are often one of the first symptoms of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding the properties of cells involved in the formation of spatial memory in a mouse model with early AD pathology will enhance our understanding of the earliest forms of cognitive decline in AD. The cells known to be important in spatial memory are place cells of the hippocampus (HPC) and grid and head direction cells of the entorhinal cortex (EC). We will use a novel approach to simultaneously record the electrophysiological properties of grid and place cells using 128-channel electrode recordings from 3 regions of the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal (EC-HPC) circuit in AD mice. We will then analyze the large-scale electrophysiological data and measure synaptic plasticity using a spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) model. Predictions from this model will be used as a guide to adjust spike timing in neurons, either enhancing or suppressing the synaptic strength of cell populations in affected regions of the EC-HPC, using optogenetic modulation. We anticipate that this will allow us to correct the spatial impairment deficits. To recapitulate te spatial orientation impairments seen in early-stage AD patients, behaviorally equivalent tasks in mice such as morphing open fields, spatial novel object recognition task and T-maze alternation tasks will be applied. These tasks have been chosen specifically to study the functioning of EC-HPC circuit neurons (CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus, lateral and medial entorhinal cortex) that get activated in relevant behavioral modes.  The proposal brings together diverse fields (electrophysiology, molecular neuroscience and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques simultaneously across multiple brain regions to develop analytical and predictive computational tests to interrogate and restore function in an important circuit that is dysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease."

My graduate and post-graduate work has focused on neuroimaging biomarkers for detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias in preclinical and prodromal stages. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with a focus on developing tools for detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. As a vehicle toward achieving my long-term career goals while expanding my knowledge and expertise, my short-term goal is to assess changes in sensory function in multiple domains in a sample of individuals with preclinical and prodromal AD to better understand the poly-sensory changes that available evidence suggests develop concurrent with and possibly precede AD pathophysiology in early stages of disease. Measures of visual function (contrast sensitivity assessed using frequency doubling technology), retinal morphology (retinal atrophy measured by optical coherence tomography), a measure of olfactory identification (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test), and measures of tonal hearing and central auditory processing (pure tone audiometry; Dichotic Sentence Identification, Dichotic Digits Test, Synthetic Sentence Identification with Ipsilateral Competing Message) , will be evaluated in older adults (aged 60 or older) at risk for progression to AD due to the presence of subjective cognitive decline in the absence of psychometric deficits1 or genetic background (family AD history and/or APOE e4 allele carrier), as well as patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, a prodromal stage of AD, and age-matched cognitively normal healthy controls without complaints or known genetic risk. I will investigate the following specific aims: [1] test the hypothesis that combining multiple sensory modalities will provide complementary information about subtle cognitive change and predict future decline in older adults in preclinical and prodromal stages of AD; [2] test the hypothesis that multi- sensory decline in preclinical and prodromal stages of AD is driven by cerebral amyloid deposition and/or neurodegeneration to determine the stage-specificity of sensory dysfunction with regard to the current theoretical framework of AD2; [3] test the hypothesis that altered brain connectivity within sensory networks is associated with measures of multi-sensory function in preclinical and prodromal AD. The long-term goal of this research is to better understand the pathophysiology underlying sensory changes in preclinical and prodromal AD, as well as to establish sensory measures as novel, non-invasive, and inexpensive biomarkers for detecting AD neuropathology in early stages. After validation, I expect these measures will be used in clinical settings for screening and/or diagnosis to improve patient care by targeting those most likely to progress to AD for therapeutic or lifestyle intervention. Validated sensory biomarkers could also be used in trials of new AD treatments to improve screening, sample enrichment, and potentially as efficacy outcome measures."

"9472265","The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand the pathophysiological processes and molecular interactions that lead to cellular dysfunction and neurotoxic vulnerability with aging, injury, and disease. Human pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny are an ideal paradigm to address these concerns because they can be used to generate fate-committed cells in the cortex that are either resistant or susceptible to neurodegenerative disease (NDD). Methods to generate and enrich for cortical inhibitory interneurons and cortical excitatory projection neurons from human pluripotent stem cells were developed during the K99 phase. The central hypothesis to be tested in this proposal is that cortical projection neurons (CPN) exhibit pathophysiological features and molecular interactions that lead to their dysfunction and death with NDD progression. This hypothesis will be tested in the R00 phase through experiments that: 1) determine the non-cell autonomous role that glial cells play in promoting neuroinflammation and conferring toxicity onto neuronal subpopulations and 2) identify the intrinsic molecular cascades that render NDD patient-derived CPN vulnerable to dysfunction and death. Successful completion of the proposed experiments will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular pathways and cellular interactions that induce or exacerbate functional decline with aging and NDD susceptibility. Furthermore, the assays in this proposal will identify pathogenic phenotypes that lead to the development of novel therapeutic targets at distinct stages of NDD progression."
"9526656","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hemophilia is caused by an inherited deficiency of clotting factor proteins, leading to both spontaneous and trauma-induced bleeding. Bleeding into joints and muscles causes acute pain, and over time repeated bleeds into joints results in arthropathy, physical disability, and chronic pain in a large proportion of adults with hemophilia. Effective management of pain in persons with hemophilia (PWH) is severely limited due to lack of valid and reliable methods for measuring pain and incorporating this information into hemophilia clinical care practices. This study addresses this critical barrier to progress toward the long-term goal of reducing the impact of pain on the lives of PWH. The overall objectives of this study are to determine whether Patient- Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures of pain intensity, interference, and behavior are valid and reliable for use in PWH and to identify factors that affect implementation of pain measurement practices within hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs). The immediate goals of the candidate for this K23 award, Dr. Tyler Buckner, are to obtain new knowledge, skills, and experience that will allow him to test the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of existing patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures in special populations, design longitudinal studies and conduct analyses of measures repeated over time, and study the implementation of incorporating PRO assessments into clinical practice. Achieving these goals will support his long term career goal of becoming a leader in the effort to improve the way that pain is assessed and managed in the hemophilia clinic. Dr. Buckner will accomplish his research and training aims with the support of his mentors, Dr. Marilyn Manco-Johnson (hemophilia clinical research), Dr. Bryce Reeve (psychometrics), Dr. Diane Fairclough (longitudinal analysis), and Dr. Jodi Holtrop (implementation science). Dr. Buckner's plan for career development is enhanced by the outstanding research environment at the University of Colorado, which provides junior faculty members with numerous didactic and training opportunities designed specifically to facilitate the transition to research career independence. The facilities and clinical and research staff of the University of Colorado HTC provide an outstanding research infrastructure that will also support Dr. Buckner's career development and research activities. Dr. Buckner's research aims to assess the following: 1) reliability and validity of PROMIS measures of pain in PWH, 2) responsiveness and ecological validity of these measures in PWH, and 3) feasibility and acceptability of implementing in-clinic and at-home pain assessments in this population. These aims will be accomplished using computerized adaptive tests to conduct both cross- sectional and longitudinal studies of the PROMIS pain measures in men with hemophilia. By completing his research and training aims, Dr. Buckner will advance the science of pain assessment in hemophilia and make a significant contribution to improving the clinical care of PWH, while also obtaining experience and training necessary to begin his career as an independent investigator and leader in hemophilia outcomes research."
"9501201","Abstract    Opiate  addiction  is  a  huge  public  health  threat  in  the  United  States  currently.  There  is  a  real  need  for  new  treatments  that  reduce  relapse  rates,  and  a  major  relapse  trigger  is  exposure  to  conditioned  drug  cues.  The  conditioned response to seek drug is intimately tied to the memory retrieved by these reminder cues. However,  repeated  exposure  to  these  cues  in  the  absence  of  reward  can  lead  to  a  diminished  conditioned  response  to  seek  drug,  through  a  process  known  as  extinction.  Extinction  is  thought  to  establish  an  opposing  inhibitory  memory  that  suppresses  the  conditioned  response,  and  has  been  shown  to  recruit  portions  of  the  prefrontal  cortex.  In  particular,  the  infralimbic  (IL)  subregion  in  rodents  exerts  this  inhibitory  control  over  downstream  effectors  that  would  otherwise  drive  the  conditioned  response.  This  is  true  for  a  number  of  conditioned  behaviors,  including  conditioned  cocaine  seeking,  food  seeking,  and  fear.  Preliminary  data  suggest  that  the  inhibitory  function  of  this  region  is  masked,  but  not  lost,  after  heroin  self-­administration.  This  may  be  due  to  a  primary  site  of  action  of  heroin  at  mu  opioid  receptors  (MORs)  in  IL,  as  activation  of  IL-­MORs  elicits  feeding  and  a  general  hyper-­appetitive  state  (Baldo  2016).  Preliminary  data  suggest  that  IL-­MORs  also  regulate  the  motivation  to  seek  heroin,  and  is  consistent  with  a  theory  separate  appetitive  driver  and  limiter  functions  exist  within  the  IL  cortex.  These  opposing  functions  may  be  encoded  by  distinct  neuronal  ensembles  within  IL  with  distinct  downstream  targets.  Two  major  efferent  targets  of  IL  that  are  known  to  regulate  both  food  and  drug  seeking  are  the  lateral  hypothalamus  (LH)  and  the  nucleus  accumbens  shell  (NAshell).  We  propose  that  IL  neuronal ensembles projecting to the LH drive heroin seeking, whereas those projecting to the NAshell inhibit  heroin  seeking.  Indeed,  preliminary  data  show  that  chemogenetic  activation  of  the  IL  to  NAshell  pathway  reduces  cue-­induced  reinstatement  of  heroin  seeking,  similar  to  our  reported  effects  in  cocaine-­seeking  animals  (Augur  et  al.  2016).  We  will  use  a  novel  TRAP-­DREADD  system  to  tag  and  reactivate  different  functional  neuronal  ensembles  in  IL  that  drive  versus  inhibit  heroin  seeking,  and  we  will  identify  their  downstream  efferent  targets  by  retrograde  tracing.  We  will  also  use  pathway-­specific  chemogenetics  to  activate  these  different  IL  efferent  pathways  and  establish  their  functional  role  in  cue-­induced  heroin  relapse.  Finally,  we  will  use  a  novel  trans-­synaptic  trans-­DREADD  strategy  to  examine  the  second-­order  circuits  controlling heroin seeking. These experiments will determine the specific functional neural circuitry of IL and its  downstream  effectors,  and  establish  their  role  in  driving  vs  limiting  heroin  seeking.  Furthermore,  this  work  will  provide  new  insight  into  the  specific  neuroanatomy  controlling  heroin  seeking  and  the  extent  to  which  these  limiter circuits can be exploited to reduce relapse.   "

The Center will remain flexible and adapt to new directions as the field of AD and related dementia research progresses."
"9471848","The concept of the neurovascular unit states that the pathophysiology of stroke, brain injury, and degeneration cannot be investigated as a purely neuronal phenomenon. Instead, interactions between cells from all neuronal, glial, and vascular compartments must be considered. The first cycle of our P01 program was focused on dissecting acute mechansims of disease in the neurovascular unit. In this renewal, we now propose to look at how the neurovascular unit undergoes repair and recovery. Project 1 (Lo/Xing: Gliovascular regulation of the microglial switch) examines how endothelium and astrocytes differentially regulate the activation of microglia. Microglia can span the range from good to bad. We will test the hypothesis that signaling at the gliovascular interface regulates the microglial switch as the neurovascular unit transitions from initial injury into repair. Project 2 (Arai/Huang: Mechanisms of recovery after white matter injury) examines how oligovascular signaling between brain endothelium and oligodendrocyte precursor cells mediate remodeling in diseased white matter. This allows us to extend the neurovascular unit concept for understanding how white matter recovers and reconnects. Project 3 (Ayata/van Leyen: Targeting ROCK for neurovascular recovery after stroke) will ask how the rho-kinase system may be a central signaling system for specific neuronal and vascular recovery endpoints during stroke recovery. This project is also our attempt at translation since it provides a potential therapeutic target for promoting neurovascular unit repair. Direct collaborations exist between all projects. All studies are supported by three cores. Core A (Boas/Sakadzic) provides powerful tools for in vivo and cellular imaging. Core B (Whalen) supports neuro-behavioral assays for assessing recovery in animal models across all projects. Core C (Lo) is our program coordination core that provides infrastructure for all collaborations We are excited about this next phase of our highly integrated P01 that dissects new mechanisms of cell-cell signaling in endothelial, glial and neuronal systems as the neurovascular unit transitions from initial injury into recovery after stroke, brain injury and degeneration."
"9457465","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The evolution of linear chromosomes in eukaryotes poses several challenges for the natural ends of chromosomes, such as misrecognition as DNA damage sites, DNA degradation, and incomplete DNA replication. A solution to these challenges has been the formation of a protective cap structure comprising a tandem array of telomeric repeats and associated proteins. The shelterin complex protects telomeres against processing by the DNA damage repair (DDR) machinery. However, the molecular basis of how shelterin remodels telomeric DNA and distinguishes telomere termini from damaged DNA ends remains unclear. These questions can be addressed by resolving the structure of shelterin-bound telomeric DNA and investigating the dynamic interplay between shelterin and DDR signals at the telomeric terminus.  Telomeric tracts shorten upon each cell division until reaching a limit at which their structural failure triggers replicative senescence. Thus, telomeres are referred to as internal biological clocks that determine the proliferative lifespan of somatic cell. In germ-line and stem cells, the loss of telomeric tracts can be reversed by telomerase, a special reverse transcriptase that adds telomeric repeats to chromosome ends. Recruitment of telomerase to the telomeric terminus and its repeat addition processivity are tightly regulated by shelterin. We currently lack an integrated understanding of telomerase's mechanochemical cycle and the specific roles that shelterin components have in modulating telomerase processivity. Further insights will be gained by real-time monitoring of telomeric repeat synthesis by telomerase at a single nucleotide resolution.  The primary objective of this proposal is to develop structural and single-molecule biophysical approaches in vitro to dissect the molecular mechanism of telomere maintenance and protection. We have three specific aims: First, we will reconstitute the human shelterin complex and determine the structure of the apo and the DNA-bound complexes using negative stain electron microscopy (EM). We will then attempt to obtain a high resolution structure of the complex using cryo-EM to reveal the protein-nucleic acid interactions that mediate the protection and maintenance of telomeres. Second, we will assemble shelterin on a model telomeric DNA substrate in a flow chamber and study how shelterin remodels telomeres into their protected form using single-molecule FRET. The dynamic interplay between shelterin and telomere- end targeting proteins will be monitored at telomeric terminus. We aim to address the conceptual dilemma of how shelterin protects telomeric terminus against binding of a DDR signaling protein, RPA (replication protein A), while allowing the recruitment of telomerase. Third, using optical trapping, we aim to identify the mechanochemical transitions associated with telomeric repeat synthesis by telomerase and provide a mechanistic explanation for the enhancement of telomerase processivity by shelterin subunits."
"9506626","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Business establishments have the potential to shape individual behaviors including dietary intake, physical activity patterns, and management of chronic medical conditions, all with relevance to risk of myocardial infarction and related cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. Policy strategies targeting local businesses may play an important role in CVD prevention, extending years of healthy life, and facilitating independent living. We propose to bring together commercially available big data and detailed population-based cohort data to examine the role of local business environments in CVD and racial disparities in CVD as they emerged across decades. Longitudinal studies of local environments have been strongly recommended as a direction for future research to advance our understanding of causal neighborhood effects on health. The local density of businesses with potential relevance to CVD has changed over time, and such temporal fluctuations vary across regions, cities and neighborhoods. These differences can be used to investigate how residentially stable older adults are affected by their local context. Meanwhile, older adults who relocate to a new home address may respond to their new context by changing health behaviors, offering another window into causation. However, careful attention is needed to acute health changes that precipitate relocation, and which local environment features predict aging in place despite new health or functional limitations. In the proposed project, we will link longitudinal data to investigate how neighborhood change and residential relocation shape cardiovascular health and health disparities. We will use a census of national businesses, the National Establishment Time Series (NETS). NETS data for all 52.4 million US business establishments includes annual point-level geocodes and business characteristics for the years 1990-2012, offering an unprecedented opportunity to characterize changing business environments nationally at multiple spatial scales. Geographic context data (from NETS as well as longitudinal population, safety, and transportation data) will be linked to individual data from two ongoing cohort studies: the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study. CHS is a well-characterized population- based study of 5,888 older adults (100% age 65+ at baseline, 58% female, 16% African American). A majority of the CHS participants enrolled 1990-1993 from four US sites, with         oversampling of African Americans, have been followed prospectively for the remainder of their lives, allowing in-depth characterization of neighborhood environments experienced by older adults in their final decades. REGARDS is also a prospective population-based cohort study with oversampling of African Americans, allowing for examination of racial disparities. However, the 30,239 REGARDS participants (49% age 65+ at baseline, 55% female, 42% African American) were enrolled more recently (2003-2007) and from a broader geographic region (48 contiguous US states, oversampling Stroke Belt residents). For these two cohorts with complementary strengths, cardiovascular events have been ascertained and longitudinal address data collected. This project brings together unparalleled data resources, builds on a track record of policy-relevant work with large geographic data resources, and leverages comprehensive cardiovascular cohort data."
"9475152","PROJECT SUMMARY  The vast majority of our nation's aging population will experience some decline in cognitive function with age. Therefore, the development of effective interventions to mitigate age-related cognitive decline is of critical importance in that those interventions might not only impact older adults' cognitive and daily life functioning, but ultimately, contribute to their health, well-being and quality of life. There is accumulating evidence that cognitive interventions targeting working memory are beneficial in that they show generalizing effects that go beyond what has been specifically trained, i.e. transfer effects, resulting in potential implications for public health, especially in an older adult population. Despite the promising results, more research is needed to make cognitive interventions more effective and more robust, and to uncover their underlying mechanisms.  The current project addresses two goals. The first goal is pragmatic, with a focus on how to make our cognitive training intervention more effective by focusing on the implementation of motivational features and the intervention's optimal scheduling (i.e., spacing of training sessions). We also will investigate the potential additive effects of working memory interventions that are combined with other approaches, such as self- efficacy interventions or electrical stimulation, investigate the intervention's longitudinal effects, and explore whether any improvements extend to measures of everyday functioning. Second, this project addresses the most important question of any intervention research by investigating the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying improvement using structural and functional neuroimaging. Furthermore, the project will shed light on individual differences as moderating factors for training and transfer success. Given the sparse availability of effective cognitive interventions, the project will have important implications in that it will shed more light on the mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in old age, and serve as groundwork for future national and international grant proposals.  For over a decade, the candidate has devoted her interdisciplinary research efforts to the investigation of working memory and related functions, as well as individual differences and age-related cognitive change. She is considered as a leader in the field of cognitive training, and her current projects that are funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA; 1R01AG049006 - 01A1) and the Institute of Education Sciences (IES; R324A150023) aim to contribute to a better understanding of the underlying behavioral and neural mechanisms of learning and transfer by focusing on either older adults (NIA) or children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Even though the specific goals and the populations in the two projects are different, they do share the overall goal to increase the intervention's efficacy and to uncover mediators and moderators of training-related change. Nonetheless, the present project will focus on older adults, since it is the candidate's long-term goal to establish herself in the field of aging, and to ultimately conduct large-scale randomized clinical trials to investigate the efficacy of targeted interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia with the means of additional R01 funding or P01/center grants.  The University of California, Irvine (UCI) supports the candidate with protected research time (75% or 9 person months) and provides an ideal research environment to conduct her translational work due to the multiple centers involving faculty from various schools and departments that are dedicated to the investigation of memory, aging, and cognitive development (e.g. the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, or the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory), and as such, provide many opportunities for intellectual discourse. The candidate has been engaged in collaborative projects with multiple faculty members at UCI, and furthermore, she has long-standing national and international collaborators (e.g., with faculty at the University of Michigan and the University of Queensland, Australia). For the duration of the proposed award, the candidate plans extended visits at those labs in order to further advance her methodological skills and to interact with distinguished faculty all over the world, which will further facilitate the candidate's career development and establish her recognition as an independent scientist.  The K02 award would provide the candidate with protected time to focus on the development of her research program and allow her to foster her national and international collaborations, and thus, enhance the potential to make significant contributions to the field of cognitive training, aging, and brain plasticity. Her research program has translational potential given its interdisciplinary approach involving Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, Gerontology, and Education.  "
"9481855","Patients with chronic disease often see a multitude of outpatient providers. For example, Medicare beneficiaries with coronary artery disease each see a median of 10 physicians (3 primary care physicians and 7 specialists) in 6 different practices each year. Seeing more than one physician may be clinically appropriate and indeed may be necessary in order to receive recommended care. However, highly fragmented care increases the risk of gaps in communication across providers. Prior studies suggest that more fragmented care can lead to suboptimal care, with more adverse drug interactions, more testing, more procedures, and lower patient satisfaction, compared to less fragmented care. However, which patients are at greatest risk for healthcare fragmentation and how fragmentation affects patient outcomes are not known. In addition, individuals' experiences of fragmented care are poorly understood, even though understanding individuals' experiences is critical for identifying potential solutions. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the association between healthcare fragmentation and cardiovascular outcomes, by conducting an ancillary study to the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. REGARDS is a national, NIH-funded prospective cohort study, which began in 2003 and is ongoing. It includes detailed data on participants' demographic characteristics, co- morbidities, psychosocial variables, and adjudicated myocardial infarction and stroke outcomes. The proposed project will include a subset of 7,120 participants for whom REGARDS data have been linked to Medicare claims at baseline. Fragmentation will be measured from claims, primarily using the Bice-Boxerman Index, a commonly used measure of fragmentation that captures both ?dispersion? (the spread of a patient's care across multiple providers) and ?density? (the relative share of visits by each provider). Fragmentation will also be measured through participant surveys, using a measure previously validated in a Medicare population. The specific aims include determining: 1) which participants are at highest risk of having healthcare fragmentation, 2) associations between claims-based fragmentation and outcomes, and 3) associations between self-reported fragmentation and outcomes. The outcomes of interest include myocardial infarction, stroke, death, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and healthcare expenditures. This study represents an innovative use of a large cohort to understand the problem of healthcare fragmentation. The research team is highly experienced and multidisciplinary, with national experts in cardiovascular epidemiology and healthcare delivery. Results from the proposed study can be used to inform the design of future interventions to decrease fragmentation and improve outcomes."
"9548538","The current proposal was inspired by our recently applied methodology for whole-genome analysis of regulatory chromatin landscape and genetic-epigenetic interactions in human brain neurons. We hypothesize that, during aging, the active chromatin in human cortical neurons is gradually modified in a subset of chromosomal loci. These chromatin modifications lead to an altered epigenetic state of activity of certain genes, contributing to vulnerability of aging neurons in brain regions vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease (AD) - related degeneration signals. We plan to identify these aging-specific neuro-chromatin signatures marked by modified histones specific for active gene promoters and active gene enhancers. We will apply ChIP-seq technology for whole-genome analysis of neuronal chromatin extracted from brain regions susceptible to AD both in a cohort of non-demented individuals stratified by age and in AD patients. We will search whether the group of genes epigenetically modified in aging and AD neurons is enriched in any gene ontology category and specific biological pathway. The genes with altered epigenetic signatures will be tested further whether they overlap with the genetic risk loci for AD and AD-related traits. We suggest that the genes for signal transducers, especially for genes with stress-response and immune functions, are targets for epigenetic modifications in aging- neurons underlying AD neurodegeneration. These predictions will be tested in animal models by direct knockdown of gene activity by a novel type of siRNA therapeutic compounds."
"9472979","Project Title: The coordination of lipid synthesis and degradation in metabolism and aging ABSTRACT/SUMMARY  Lipid imbalances are characteristic of obesity and a feature of many age-related ailments and reproductive pathologies in humans. Yet, the relationship between lipid metabolism, aging and reproduction remains poorly studied. We propose to use the nematode C. elegans to characterize this relationship. In particular, we propose to investigate how the balance between lipid synthesis and breakdown influences an organism's rate of aging and health.  In C. elegans, eliminating the germline extends lifespan. Besides fertility loss, germline removal is a major challenge to lipid metabolism because the animal needs to stop fat deposition into eggs and reorganize its lipid profile. Thus, germline-less worms provide a unique platform to understand how lipid balance is established in the cells and tissues of complex multicellular animals that are facing major physiological changes. We have discovered that fat production and degradation appear to be increased simultaneously in response to germline loss in worms. We recently demonstrated that in germline-less adults a conserved transcription factor, NHR-49, upregulate fatty-acid ?-oxidation and desaturation- processes that contribute to lipid breakdown and build-up, respectively. Independently, we have also discovered that these two, and many other processes involved in lipid synthesis and degradation, are elevated in response to germline removal by the conserved transcription factors, DAF-16 and TCER-1. These data have led us to hypothesize that the coordinated enhancement of lipid synthesis and breakdown facilitates the adaptation to germline loss by ensuring lipid homeostasis. We propose to test this hypothesis by using molecular genetics, microscopy and biochemical approaches. The knowledge obtained from these studies is likely to reveal fundamental insights into the relationship of lipid metabolism, reproduction and aging.  These studies are of relevance to human health and disease because they address major public health issues such as aging and obesity. The discoveries made through these experiments can lead to the discovery of therapeutic interventions targeting age-related ailments and metabolic diseases."
"9475332","Neuronal differentiation requires the precise orchestration of gene expression programs. Temporal control of transcription is particularly important in maturing postmitotic neurons of the postnatal brain because these cells need to express gene products that refine neuronal function and circuitry during specific critical periods of brain development. Epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure is known to play a role in establishing cell-type specific programs of gene expression during early stages of cell fate determination, but the chromatin mechanisms that regulate gene expression during terminal phases of differentiation remain to be fully understood. The goal of this proposal is to identify chromatin mechanisms that coordinate the induction of genes in maturing neurons of the CNS. To discover these chromatin mechanisms of neuronal differentiation, and to determine how these mechanisms are regulated across multiple stages of neuronal maturation, we have characterized chromatin accessibility, enhancer activation, and gene expression in differentiating cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) of the postnatal mouse in vivo. We have observed that thousands of regulatory elements show chromatin accessibility changes as CGNs differentiate, and we have verified that many of these differentially accessible regions function as developmental stage-specific enhancers of neuronal genes. Furthermore our data identify a specific group of the genes selectively expressed in mature CGNs of the cerebellum that are associated with repressive histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at early postmitotic stages of CGN differentiation yet lose this mark as CGNs mature. Consistent with a role for active histone demethylation in the induction of these genes, we find that at least a subset of these genes show increased H3K27me3 and reduced mRNA expression in CGNs lacking the H3K27 demethylase Kdm6b. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the molecular regulators of H3K27me3 dynamics in postmitotic neurons play a key role in timing neuronal maturation. To address this hypothesis we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To characterize the dynamic demethylation of H3K27 in postmitotic neurons maturing in vivo, 2) To determine the role of the H3K27 demethylase Kdm6b in neuronal maturation, and 3) To identify enhancer mechanisms of transcriptional derepression in maturing neurons. Together these studies will identify the molecular mechanisms that mediate the gene-specific loss of H3K27me3 in maturing CGNs, and they will directly test the importance of the developmental derepression of H3K27me3-silenced genes for functional neuronal maturation."
"9475759","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The Pennington Biomedical (PBRC)/Louisiana Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NORC) was initially established in 2005 to facilitate and promote collaborative and multi-disciplinary interactions to foster new research ideas and enhance the translation of basic nutritional research findings into the clinical arena and ultimately into practical application. In agreement with the reviewers' feedback, we have now expanded from our original theme of nutritional programing to emphasize the more general theme of nutrition, obesity and metabolic health through the lifespan. Like most of the NIDDK NORCs, our research base is related to the metabolic consequences of nutrition on health and diseases. During this upcoming NORC cycle, we plan to progressively develop research teams focusing on 3 critical periods of the life cycle: 1) Maternal/Infant nutritional status and metabolic consequences; 2) Pediatric and Adulthood Obesity and metabolic health; 3) Nutritional status at older age to preserve physical and cognitive functionality. These three research foci will lead to the formation of Research Teams to address big research questions from the basic science level, to clinical investigation and finally to the population in a translational way. In each of these teams, research will focus on th mechanisms involved in health and disease, the study of treatment intervention and the implementation of preventive strategies. The long standing tradition of nutrition and obesity research at Pennington Biomedical provides an ideal academic environment to undertake interdisciplinary efforts to investigate the environmental and molecular interactions to cause obesity and impair metabolic health (metabolic syndrome). With our past 5 years extension of resources (faculty, clinical space, equipment, and support personnel), and an established cadre of outstanding scientists, a Pennington NORC catalyzes novel nutrition and obesity research around the targeted theme. We now have a research base of > $21 million/year in direct cost with 40 regular members with NIH funding or equivalent and another 89 collaborating members at Pennington and across the country For this 3rd grant funding cycle, the goals of the Pennington/Louisiana NORC are: 1. To stimulate and support new and innovative research in nutrition and obesity among investigators at  Pennington and in Louisiana by enhancing interaction between basic, clinical and public health scientists; 2. To provide state-of-the-art an cost-effective Scientific Cores, which provide efficient high quality  services, develop new methods and provide consultation to users, in particular NIDDK-funded project PIs; 3. To enhance the translation of discoveries in basic science to human clinical investigation in obesity   and nutrition research by incentivizing cross-talk and research collaboration among disciplines; 4. To attract new investigators to the field of nutrition by reaching out to scientists across Louisiana and  the country and by encouraging and facilitating the use of our NORC resources; 5. To progressively develop research teams focusing on 3 periods of the life cycle: 1) Maternal/Infant  nutritional status; 2) Pediatric and Adulthood Obesity and metabolic health; 3) Nutritional status at older  age to preserve physical and cognitive functionality. 6. To provide a Pilot and Feasibility program to expand the sphere of obesity & metabolic health research; 7. To foster and enhance the development of junior NORC members (postdocs and junior faculty) as  independent and creative investigators via mentoring, specialized training, advice from core leaders; 8. To coordinate and promote community outreach activities in the greater Baton Rouge area and in  Louisiana by providing nutrition education, nutrition and health assessments, and nutritional interventions,  which promote wellness, improve health and reduce obesity; 9. To promote the translation of research findings by promoting efficient and effective communication that  might not otherwise happen, among NORC members and those in clinical and health services research."
"9480092","PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Jaitovich academic training, research experience and intense drive place him in an excellent position for a successful career as an independent physician/scientist. Dr. Jaitovich is an Argentinean immigrant who has developed extensive expertise in the field of protein turnover and degradation, and has worked in collaboration with Nobel Prize- winner Aaron Ciechanover, which reflects his remarkable standard of training in that field. In addition, he has been recruited as Assistant Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Albany Medical College based on feedback he received upon submission of his NRSA award. At that time, and due to his strong interest in skeletal muscle atrophy in the context of pulmonary diseases, he was recommended to find an institution with higher expertise in muscle biology. He has recently established collaborations with two world experts in animal models of emphysema: Drs. Jack Elias and Jeanine D?Armiento, who will provide him the opportunity to test his hypotheses in complementary transgenic animals with previously developed lung disease. Dr. Jaitovich intends to pursue a career in academic medicine with a strong commitment to innovative basic and translational research. He has used his fellowship training to gain expertise in cell biology and in murine models of disease. Supported by this award, he will establish a novel niche within the area of muscle atrophy in the context of advanced pulmonary disease. Training supported by this K01 award will allow him to pursue his career as an independent investigator. Environment Mentorship: The Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and the Center for Cardiovascular Sciences at the Albany Medical College are committed to fostering the academic careers of outstanding junior faculty like Dr. Jaitovich. Drs. Harold Singer, Yong-Xiao Wang and Dale Tang are well-funded, established investigators with a long track record of training. Their laboratories have the tools and resources required to complete the proposed studies, which have been specifically crafted to develop a novel and innovative research program independent from their own, and which will facilitate Dr. Jaitovich career. In addition, Dr. Jaitovich will receive full collaboration from Dr. Jacob Sznajder (Northwestern University), who is an expert in CO2-mediated cell signaling; Dr. Jack Elias (Brown University), who is an expert in animal models of emphysema/COPD; Dr. Jeanine D?Armiento (Columbia University), who is also an expert in animal models of emphysema and has described one of the first transgenic animals of that kind (lung MMP1+/- expression); Dr. Gustavo Nader (Penn State University), who has advanced expertise in regulation of anabolism in skeletal muscle; Dr. Esther Barreiro (Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona), a leading scientist in the field of COPD- associated muscle atrophy; and Dr. Jiang Qian (Albany Medical Center), who is the head of the neuromuscular core at the Department of Pathology of AMC. Environment: Dr. Jaitovich will conduct his research training in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and the Center for Cardiovascular Sciences at the Albany Medical College (AMC). Additionally, he will have off-site collaboration from Northwestern University, Brown University, Columbia University, Penn State University, and Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Spain). Strong collaborations between the different federally funded investigators in this institution combined with their interactions with investigators in the AMC community and around the world provide an ideal environment for Dr. Jaitovich to develop an independent research program. Research: High CO2 in the blood or hypercapnia is common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These patients frequently develop skeletal muscle atrophy. Both hypercapnia and skeletal muscle atrophy are independent predictors of worse outcome in these populations. We recently reported that exposure to high CO2 leads to muscle atrophy and anabolic suppression in vitro and in vivo. This process occurs via CO2-induced AMPK phosphorylation, which targets the transcription factor FoxO3a, which (after nuclear translocation) induces the expression of the muscle-specific E-3 ligase MuRF1. These events lead to proteasome-mediated protein degradation and muscle atrophy. Here, we plan to expand our mechanistic insight and determine how hypercapnia causally leads to AMPK activation and net muscle loss; and evaluate these processes in skeletal muscles from emphysematous mice. Specific Aim 1: To determine the mechanism leading to AMPK phosphorylation under CO2 stimulation. We will explore the upstream signals that mediate high CO2-induced AMPK phosphorylation with particular emphasis to the distinct influence of calcium currents and mitochondrial dysfunction. To do that, we will use gain and loss-of-function approaches to determine the effect of CO2 on muscle cell signaling. Specific Aim 2: To determine whether hypercapnia leads to an AMPK-dependent down-regulation of skeletal muscle anabolism through phosphorylation of TIF-1A. We will investigate if high CO2-induced down regulation of 45s pre-rRNA occurs through the AMPK?1-mediated phosphorylation of TIF-1A and decreased TIF-1A/TBP- SL1 interaction, precluding the assembly of functional transcription initiation complexes. Specific Aim 3: To determine if genetically modified animals that develop pulmonary emphysema (IL-13 and MMP1+/-) display accelerated skeletal muscle atrophy under high CO2 compared to wild type littermates. We will also explore the relevance of the AMPK-MuRF1 axis in that process; and the rate of muscle anabolism in normo and hypercapnia in both wild type and transgenic mice."
"9475716","ABSTRACT  By 2030, over 20% of the US population will be at least 65 years old, the age at which incidence of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) begins to increase. In 2014, 17% of the population living in rural areas was already over the age of 65, suggesting that rural populations may be disproportionally affected by ADRD in current and coming years. There is growing evidence that disparities in disease burden as well as availability, accessibility, affordability, and acceptability of health services exist among older adults living in rural areas, likely contributing to the growing gap in life expectancy witnessed between urban and rural communities. Previous studies have found that ADRD prevalence rates vary by gender, race, and ethnicity, yet few studies have examined disparities in diagnosis and outcomes of older adults living in urban and rural areas. Studies that have examined rural health disparities related to ADRD have largely focused on issues related to access to care, and suggest that ADRD patients in rural areas are more likely to receive suboptimal healthcare. There is a gap in our knowledge on how place of residence influences diagnosis and subsequent outcomes of older adults with ADRD. Understanding if disparities exist for older adults with ADRD living in rural areas could yield important insights into the risk factors for ADRD, the variables influencing the experience of living with ADRD, and the methods by which they can be more effectively managed. The objective of this application, the first step toward this long-term goal, is to conduct a population based study and thorough analysis to identify if rural-urban disparities in the diagnostic incidence and prevalence of ADRD, healthcare utilization, and health outcomes exist. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that rural Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD will be diagnosed later in the course of their disease and experience worse health outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work that shows the prevalence rate of ADRD is lower, yet the mortality rate due to ADRD is higher in states with a higher share of its population living in rural areas. To achieve this objective, we propose two aims. First, we will compare the diagnostic incidence and prevalence of ADRD between Medicare beneficiaries living in rural and urban communities. Second, we will compare survival and trajectories of acute, nursing home and home health care use in six years following the initial diagnosis of ADRD between rural and urban beneficiaries. We propose to study fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries in 2008-2015 integrating Medicare enrollment, claims, and resident assessment data. Findings of this study have several expected benefits for many. For policy makers, this research will enable evidence-based policy development aimed at improving rural health care. For rural health providers, this work will drive efforts to improve ADRD screening in order to ensure rural beneficiaries receive a timely diagnosis, which may delay future adverse outcomes. For rural health systems, these findings will help plan for future demand and understand gaps in our current system in meeting this population's needs."

NRSA TRAINING CORE (PRE- AND POST-DOC) SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI) has a sustained record of equipping TL1 pre- doctoral (for 9 years) and postdoctoral trainees (for 4 years) through its Career development, Education and Research Training (CERT) Program. First, CERT has trained 86 CTSI predoctoral trainees over 9 funding cycles. Predoctoral program completers continue in research a high level with a median percent research time of 60%. The majority remain in academic or research positions. Second, CERT has trained 10 postdoctoral trainees over 3 funding cycles with most program completers retained in academic positions and spending a median of 90% of their time in research. Third, there has been substantial diversity in our TL1 program in terms of gender (57.3%), underrepresented minorities (12.5%), and scientific disciplines (27 different disciplines for predoctoral and 8 different disciplines for postdoctoral trainees). Also, the type of trainee research spans across the T1 to T4 translational research spectrum. The four specific aims of the TL1 NRSA Training Core proposed in this application are to: 1) Increase the flexibility and reach of our foundational programs, particularly through asynchronous and/or online strategies, outreach to new scientific audiences (e.g., dental, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, optometry, allied health) and attention to trainees earlier in the pipeline. 2) Maximize the career development components of TL1 training, including essential support (e.g., grant writing skills, biostatistics, and mentor training), salient knowledge and skills, and targeted training to fill gaps in the clinical and translational science workforce where the CERT program is especially strong (using big data, implementation science, community engagement and communication, and drug development). 3) Develop research training in 3 new areas: team science, entrepreneurship, and experiential learning. 4) Pursue regional and national CTSA collaborations for greater innovation and impact. The key model that guides our strategic initiatives is the continuous innovation cycle of ?4Ds? that we adopt in all of our CTSI activities: Design, Demonstrate, Duplicate, and Disseminate. We also created innovative initiatives that could serve as model programs for dissemination more broadly. These include a) an I-Corps training; b) national coordination of experiential training opportunities with industry partners; c) hybrid postdoctoral training between the academia and an industry, community, government, or health care partner. Finally, we have plans for further enhancing recruitment and retention of underrepresent minority scientists. We are enhancing instructions in the responsible conduct of research with a new course in translational research ethics, and evaluations with Common Metrics plus novel metrics. Abbreviations: CERT ?

"9281582","ABSTRACT  Our Phase 1 (P-I)/Phase 2 (P-II) effort has enabled us to define the study of neuropsychiatric illness through the lens of systematic multimodal imaging as the thematic area of focus. We feel that we can be competitive at the national level for a center grant beyond the P-III given our current trajectory. During P-I/P-II we developed a strong state-of-the-art infrastructure and a strong research base composed of established faculty and successfully graduated junior PIs, some of whom now serve as core directors and mentors as part of our P-II and Phase 3 (P-III) COBRE programs (detailed in the various cores). Although the number of R01 grants won by local investigators meets the minimum requirement for consideration for a center grant, we still need to increase the number of R01s from MRN/UNM and other research institutions in NM in order to be competitive nationally. The proposed Pilot Project Program (PPP) is designed to maximize our ability to achieve this goal. The PPP will fund three categories of faculty members: (1) current P-II junior PIs and pilot project PIs who have existing pilot projects and need further support beyond their P-II projects; (2) junior faculty members with strong proposals who will be supported as new investigators during P-III; and (3) senior faculty members who wish to include neuroimaging as a new component of their pre-clinical or clinical research program to expand the scope of research. We will allocate a total of up to $250,000/year for our PPP, consisting of $125,000/year requested from the NIGMS and $125,000/year in institutional match funds. This funding will be used to support up to 5 projects at $50,000/project/year. To encourage productivity, each project will be funded for 1 year at a time, with the possibility for competitive renewal if meeting documented criteria and after evaluation by the steering committee (SC). The PPP will establish a training program for each successful PPP investigator on the use of the cores and will implement a mentoring program reminiscent of our P-II mentoring program, to provide mentorship to all 3 categories of funded faculty members. The selection of PPP-supported investigators and the oversight of our PPP will be carried out by the SC consisting of members of our P-II internal faculty development committee along with an administrative member and three core users. 2"
"9527915","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Intestinal macrophage dysfunction is recognized as a central component to the pathogenesis of IBD. Intestinal macrophages (M?) exhibit an ?anergic?/anti-inflammatory phenotype in response to bacterial products and are critical in maintaining gut homeostasis. They are generated through continuous replenishment by circulating CCR2+Ly6Chi monocytes that differentiate locally into mature, anti-inflammatory macrophages. Intestinal macrophages are characterized by high expression of the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 and MHC class II molecules and produce high levels of IL-10 in response to LPS stimulation. Colonic macrophages are critical in the differentiation of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. However, the molecular cues that drive the development of ?regulatory? intestinal macrophages are poorly characterized. We have recently demonstrated that the TGF? early response gene, KLF10, which belongs to a Sp1/Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factor, is critically involved in regulating colitis development though colonic macrophage dysregulation. KLF10 may suppress macrophages activation at least in part through augmenting TGF? signaling. We have shown that, similarly to CD8+ T lymphocytes, KLF10 directly binds to the TGF?RII promoter in macrophages, leading to enhanced gene expression through histone H3 acetylation. Collectively, our data reveal a critical role for KLF10 in the epigenetic regulation of TGF?RII expression in macrophages and the acquisition of a regulatory phenotype that contributes to intestinal mucosal homeostasis. However, regulation of TGF?RII expression may not be the only mechanism by which KLF10 may regulate the generation of the anti-inflammatory intestinal macrophage phenotype. We have also shown that KLF10 may directly regulate primarily the expression of early inflammatory genes in macrophages such as CXCL1 and TNF-?, but has no effect on the regulation of other genes such as CCL2 or CCL3. We, thus, propose that KLF10 is an important transcriptional regulator of intestinal macrophage differentiation and anti-inflammatory function in vivo. KLF10 may epigenetically regulate the transition of inflammatory CCR2+Ly6Chi monocytes to tissue resident macrophages with potent anti- inflammatory properties (e.g. suppression of pro-inflammatory gene expression and up-regulation of IL-10). In the current proposal, we will further dissect the molecular pathways by which KLF10 regulates LPS-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression in intestinal and BM-derived macrophages. Our CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is that KLF10 epigenetically regulates macrophage activation resulting in the development of anti-inflammatory intestinal macrophage which control mucosal inflammation in vivo. The specific aims of our proposal include: Aim #1: KLF10 epigenetically regulates the anti-inflammatory program of intestinal macrophages. Explore the epigenetic mechanisms by which KLF10 regulates pro-inflammatory gene expression in macrophages. Aim #2: KLF10 deficiency in Innate Immune Cells leads to mucosal immune dysregulation and colitis. Characterize the functional effect of KLF10 deficiency in Innate Immune Cells in the development of T cell- mediated colitis."
"9513890","The translation of basic biomedical knowledge to the development of effective therapeutic approaches depends on validated animal models that accurately reflect human diseases and clinically relevant and valid outcome measures. While it is widely appreciated that dystrophinopathy (BDMD) patients suffer progressive loss of skeletal muscle function, disease etiology is evolving to include significant cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death due largely to effective respiratory support therapy. While existing models have been and continue to be useful tools for mechanistic studies and initial discovery investigations, inherent limitations necessitate the continued development of large animal models for translational research. Hence, there is an unmet need to internally and externally validate novel models of BDMD that clearly and predictively recapitulate progressive dysfunction caused by dystrophinopathy as assessed by clinically relevant and validated measures. Our long-term goal is to achieve a detailed understanding of BDMD to enable development and testing of effective interventional strategies. To facilitate these translational studies, we have recently initiated the characterization of a novel, spontaneously occurring porcine BDMD model (exon 41 point mutation). The objective of this application is to perform internal and external validation studies focused on progressive skeletal and cardiac muscle dysfunction in order to insert this spontaneously occurring model into the drug discovery pipeline. This objective is buttressed by strong biological and translational rationale demonstrating a genetic cause of the disease consistent with human disease. Further, our previous work and preliminary data show resultant, progressive skeletal muscle injury and dysfunction, and progressive cardiomyopathy, which are also consistent with human dystrophinopathy. In the internal validation phase of this proposal during R21 Aim 1, we will internally validate objective measures of locomotion and respiratory function during disease progression. In R21 Aim 2 we will also apply well-validated echocardiography and electrophysiology approaches for use in this model as the disease advances. Together with our clinical partner we will determine if our measures have been internally validated. Should that be the case we will proceed to external validation studies. In the R33 phase, to demonstrate predictive validity, we will treat affected pigs with pharmacological agents used widely by BDMD patients. Specifically, to improve skeletal muscle function pigs will be treated with prednisone, and to improve cardiac function pigs will be treated with Lisinopril as both have repeatedly been shown to improve skeletal and cardiac muscle function, respectively. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it aims to internally and externally validate progressive skeletal and cardiac muscle dysfunction in a novel, miniature porcine muscular dystrophy model. This research is significant for drug discovery because it would enable, for the first time, testing of an array of treatment approaches (conventional and gene therapy) in a human-sized model that closely reflects human pathophysiological progression, particularly in the cardiovascular system."
"9519659","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Investigation to Minimize Prolapse Recurrence Of the Vagina using Estrogen (IMPROVE) Pelvic organ prolapse, a condition in which the pelvic organs (bladder, vagina, cervix and uterus) herniate through the vaginal opening, is a very common pelvic floor disorder with substantial social and psychological implications that affect the quality of life for women. Increasing age is a known risk factor for prolapse and urinary incontinence. The lifetime risk of surgery for prolapse or stress urinary incontinence is 20% (and 13% for prolapse surgery alone); projections for 2050 are that the number of US women with prolapse will increase 46% from 3.3 to 4.9 million, placing an even greater burden on our healthcare system. Recurrent prolapse and reoperation are also common; at least 17% of patients who have surgical repairs undergo repeat operations within 10 years, and a greater number have recurrence of bothersome symptoms. To address these high failure and reoperation rates-particularly in aging or post-menopausal women-there is an urgent need to identify adjuncts to native tissue prolapse repairs that may prevent or minimize recurrent disease. Our pilot trial of preoperative intravaginal estrogen treatment vs. placebo in postmenopausal women with prolapse demonstrated increased thickness and greater content of well-organized collagen (i.e., type I) of the vaginal wall muscularis in estrogen-treated women. Up-regulation of collagen type I was accompanied by down- regulation of several proteases, suggesting perioperative vaginal estrogen in postmenopausal women with prolapse may mitigate surgical induction of several degradative enzymes and thereby improve long-term maintenance of connective tissue integrity of the pelvic floor. In this application, we propose a double-blind randomized trial of intravaginal estrogen (conjugated estrogens, 0.625mg/1g cream) vs. placebo in postmenopausal women (n=276 total) with symptomatic prolapse beyond the hymen planning transvaginal native tissue repairs. Medication will be continued 1 year postoperatively, i.e. until scar remodeling is complete. We aim to determine if pre- and postoperative intravaginal estrogen therapy (i) results in anatomic and patient-reported subjective improvement in pelvic organ support, and (ii) impacts other pelvic floor disorders (overactive bladder and incontinence, sexual function and pain, postoperative cystitis), satisfaction, quality of life, and vaginal wound healing. Finally, (iii) we will determine the potetial mechanisms by which local estrogen treatment alters pelvic organ support by examining full-thickness vaginal wall biopsies taken at the time of surgery for histologic, connective tissue, and smooth muscle synthesis and degradative changes. We expect this will highlight other novel targets for future therapies in prolapse repair and prevention."

"9523119","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a revised application for a K23 Patient-Oriented Mentored Career Development award by Kristine Erlandson, MD. Her proposed research will focus on disturbance in the growth hormone axis as a potential mechanism for physical function decline among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults. Candidate: Dr. Erlandson is a board-certified internist and infectious disease specialist. She is currently an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Divisions of Infectious Diseases and Geriatric Medicine at the University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus School of Medicine. Dr. Erlandson seeks research training in the disciplines of geriatric medicine, endocrinology/metabolism, and infectious diseases so she can develop the skills needed to investigate complications of aging in HIV infection. Training: Through hands-on mentored research, formal coursework, and conferences/seminars, Dr. Erlandson's K23 career development plan will focus on: 1) developing skills in design and implementation of prospective longitudinal clinical research studies; 2) learning to conduct, analyze and interpret studies of th growth hormone axis, including effects of sleep; 3) improving knowledge & skills for aging research including conduct of physical function assessments, exercise testing, and muscle biopsies; and 4) strengthening research leadership abilities and expanding research collaborations. Mentors/Environment: Dr. Erlandson has assembled a team of mentors and consultants to bridge the multiple research disciplines necessary to effectively investigate aging in HIV. As mentors, Drs. Campbell, Schwartz, and Brown will provide expertise and career guidance in HIV research (Campbell), aging research (Schwartz), growth hormone and other aspects of endocrinology (Brown, Schwartz), design and conduct of longitudinal clinical trials (Schwartz, Campbell, Brown). Collaborators in sleep (Burgess), statistical analysis of hormone secretion patterns (Carlson), and frequent hormone sampling (Wright) will support Dr. Erlandson in the proposed training and research activities. Additionally, clinical research infrastructure, data management, and statistical support of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group will be available to Dr. Erlandson for the implementation of AIDS Clinical Trials Group-sponsored clinical trials. The stored samples and robust data from HIV-uninfected persons from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study and the Women's Interagency HIV Study will provide a control group with similar demographic and HIV risk acquisition factors. The University of Colorado will provide research support through the Colorado Clinical and Translational Science Institute (supported by the NIH Clinical Translational Sciences Award), the Graduate School, School of Public Health, numerous opportunities for mentoring, leadership, and teaching, an HIV clinic that provides care for over 1500 patients, a robust multi-disciplinary outpatient Senior's Clinic, and the Hartford Center for Geriatric Excellence. Research: In comparison to similar HIV- populations, HIV+ persons, even when on effective antiretroviral therapy, experience an excess of morbidity and mortality. Persons on ART rarely die from complications of AIDS, but instead have early onset of aging complications including impaired physical function5,16,17, frailty18-22, and falls4. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I is the primary mediator of growth hormone (GH) on muscle and bone. Low IGF-I is associated with frailty, sarcopenia (low muscle mass and strength), and mortality in some aging cohorts. In our cohort of middle-aged HIV+ adults on effective ART, lower IGF-I was associated with a significantly greater odds of functional impairment. Based on our data, we believe impairment in the GH/IGF-I axis may be an important pathway leading to aging complications in HIV. Using five unique, existing cohorts, the proposed project will evaluate the longitudinal association of IGF-I with functional impairment over 144 weeks between HIV+ and HIV- adults (Aim 1); the change in IGF-I with randomized initiation of ART (Aim 2); and the impact of both HIV and age on 24-hour GH secretory patterns (Aim 3). Summary: This will be the first study to evaluate 1) an association of IGF-I with the physical function trajectory among older HIV+ adults, 2) the impact of ART initiation on IGF-I among persons with HIV, and 3) the 24-hour GH secretion patterns in older adults with or without HIV infection. Dr. Erlandson's implementation of this mentored research and training proposal The Impact of HIV and Aging on Physical Function and the Somatopause, will facilitate her development into an independent investigator and leader in the fields of HIV, successful aging, and physical function."

"9476785","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goals of this T32 post-doctoral Training Program are twofold: 1). To recruit the best and brightest young physicians and basic science trainees interested in successful  academic careers in biomedical research operating at the translational interface between bench and bedside using the contemporary tools of Reproduction, Development, and Genetics; and 2). To provide these high quality trainees with a secure period of stable funding so they can be exposed to:  a) a rich spectrum of competitively funded and challenging biomedical problems; b) the most  contemporary tools with which to attack them; c) optimal didactic experiences; and d) carefully mentored  research experiences during periods of increasing autonomy.  Taken together, this tight matrix of interwoven experiences equips our trainees with the foundational experiences necessary to achieve independence in research as is attested to by this program's track record of previous trainees.  The key elements of success in meeting these goals are a rich pool of talented applicants and an exciting context within an Academic Medical Center. Our parent institution, the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), has a strong focus on human disease/disease models with a rich tradition of inter-disciplinary collaboration across a broad mix of talented training faculty (Tables 1 & 2). Each faculty member has been carefully selected by the Program Directors (PDs) on the basis of their demonstrated commitment to the independence of their trainees, exciting and important biologic problems on which to work, and stable funding.  The spectrum of our program's planned research projects occurs in the laboratories of 11 mid- and senior level faculty members (Tables 1-4), each focused on key questions in human development, reproduction, systems and molecular biology, and/or genetics. Our Training Program taps into an exciting blend of basic and clinical researchers who have chosen to focus their interdisciplinary skills on human disease targets, i.e. the genetics of Mendelian development disorders like Isolated GnRH Deficiency, fetal congenital lung and diaphragmatic anomalies, neurologic disorders, as well as complex genetic disorders such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).  Given our nation's pressing need and expressed priorities for training translational researchers pointed out by the Institute of Medicine's Clinical Research Roundtable (References Cited: 1 & 2) as well as the powerful synergies emerging in reproduction, development and genetics, we propose to continue our current level of training 4 physicians and/or basic scientists for the next 5 years of this competing renewal application."
"9432176","Abstract Hedgehog signals are the key regulators of embryonic patterning and adult tissue homeostasis. Consequently, defects in Hedgehog signaling can cause developmental diseases, congenital heart disease, and cancers such as basal cell carcinoma. There is an urgent need to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the modulation of Hedgehog signaling pathway for its potential preventative and therapeutic value. It is known ver- tebrate Hedgehog signaling relies on the ciliary trafficking of Hedgehog signaling receptors, among which smoothened (SMO) is the central positive mediator of Hedgehog signaling. If mutations occur in either intrafla- gellar transporters (IFTs), or in the ciliary transition zone, SMO activities can be severely disrupted. However, the molecular mechanism of how IFT particles and transition zone regulate trafficking of SMO is currently un- known. Determination of the molecular regulation mechanisms is the objective of this application. Our prelimi- nary data acquired by Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) showed the colocalization of transition zone proteins with SMO and IFT88, suggesting that transition zone proteins and IFT particles interact with SMO. Based on previous studies and our own primary data, my central hypothesis is that the transition zone serves as a checkpoint for Hedgehog signaling receptors, and IFTs help Hedgehog signaling receptors cross the transition zone. This transition zone checkpoint model represents a novel mechanism for the control of cilium trafficking and the cross-interaction between different ciliary cargos. It could potentially allow new ap- proaches to manipulate Hedgehog signals, and underlie the foundation for treatments of diseases caused by defects in Hedgehog signaling. To approach to the project, I plan to map SMO molecules and IFT particles in the transition zone using multicolor 3D STORM. It will reveal the spatial relationship between SMO molecules and these ciliary components at a resolution of ~15 nm. Algorithms will be developed to reduce the uncertainty of the spatial easements caused by structural heterogeneity and immunostaining, providing a ~ 5nm precision of the distance between investigated proteins, indicating protein-protein interaction. Equally important as the static structural study, I also plan to detect the interactions among SMO molecules, IFT particles, and transition zone proteins dynamically using single-particle tracking and photoconversion imaging. The proposed project will not only offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Hedgehog signaling regulation, but also ad- vance a suite of microscopy-based technologies and algorithms that can be broadly applied to the fields of cell signaling and structural biology. Furthermore, the results are expected to have broad impact, because the reg- ulatory components to be identified by this project will provide new mechanisms and new drug screen for pre- ventive and therapeutic interventions. 1"

"9471765","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Unrelenting growth in the number of elderly in our society and the resulting impact on the prevalence of age- related disease will have dramatic economic and health-related consequences over the next two decades. Although the causes and consequences of many diseases, including cancer and dementia, are slowly being unraveled, the mechanisms that underlie advanced age as the most significant risk factor associated with these disease states are relatively unknown. This is an important issue because single interventions that impact mechanisms of aging would be expected to ameliorate or eliminate multiple pathologies and diseases. We are, therefore, not just talking about extending lifespan; advances in understanding the basic biology of aging would have tremendous general health benefits as well. Our understanding of mammalian aging has been greatly stimulated over the past decade by research in simple model systems. Arguably, today's most effective aging-related interventions in mice target sirtuin genes, as well as TOR and insulin/IGF signaling pathways, all of which were first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster. In recent years, modern molecular genetics, often using simple model organisms, has provided a well-defined biological framework for understanding the causes and consequences of decision-making. Information entering the brain from canonical sensory systems and internal homeostatic mechanisms is received, integrated, and dispatched to orchestrate changes in peripheral tissues. We believe that these 'decisions' are important modulators of aging. More specifically, our hypothesis is that specific mechanisms that evaluate internal and external nutrient availability and initiate physiological changes associated with states such as hunger and satiety play important roles in the modulation of behavior and lifespan. Harnessing the neurobiology of simple model systems to study the impact of how physiological decisions are made in response to evaluated energy status will yield insights into the broad influence of nutrients on longevity across taxa, includin humans. It will also provide an understanding of the molecular details about how neuronal inputs orchestrate cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms to insure survival and health in a complex organism. The innovative nature of this proposal, which derives from the uniquely appropriate tools available in Drosophila together with a novel perspective about the importance of evaluative and sensory influences on lifespan, provides the creativity and experimental power to develop and test hypotheses about the cell non-autonomous control of aging that have not been previously considered. In addition to providing an opportunity to discover basic mechanisms of aging, our work may also lead to creative intervention strategies that ameliorate aging-related functional decline in humans."
"9461530","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is emerging as one of the most common liver disease in the American population. It is a metabolic disorder in which fat accumulation within the liver (steatosis) is associated with inflammation, hepatic injury and cirrhosis without significant consumption of alcohol. Despite affecting 2-5% of the American population, there are currently no effective therapeutic treatments for NASH. Current knowledge of this disease is limited because early stages (simple steatosis) are asymptomatic and difficult to detect. Furthermore, development of effective therapeutics against NASH pathology has been slow due to lack of a feasible and robust model system. We have discovered that hepatocyte-specific ablation of SRSF1 (SRSF1 HKO), a splicing regulatory protein, triggers severe and early onset of NASH phenotype. SRSF1 plays direct roles in both constitutive and alternative splicing and has recently been shown to also regulate translation and non-sense mediated decay of specific transcripts. Although the structural and functional roles of SRSF1 in splicing are extensively characterized, its role in tissue physiology is not well understood. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the pathogenic mechanism(s) by which loss of SRSF1 results in NASH. Aim 1. We will first determine the underlying molecular irregularities promoting liver damage in our mouse model. Using an in vivo viral mediated SRSF1 HKO model, I will identify which of the activated mechanisms are primary versus secondary responses to loss of SRSF1 activity. We also have preliminary data which shows that MALAT1, a long non-coding RNA, has lost association to nuclear speckles in the SRSF1 HKO hepatocytes. Speckles are highly dynamic nuclear domains enriched with pre-mRNA splicing factors, RNA processing factors and RNA molecules including MALAT1. We will further investigate speckle composition in SRSF1 HKO hepatocytes and determine if loss of MALAT1 localization to speckles has direct implications in the development of NASH pathology. Aim 2. Secondly, we will construct the gene network regulated by SRSF1 by performing high-resolution RNA-Seq on hepatocytes isolated from wildtype and SRSF1 HKO mice. We will also determine direct mRNA targets of SRSF1 using iCLIP-Seq, a method used to identify protein-RNA interactions in living cells. Data from both of these approaches will allow for the construction ofa robust gene regulatory network. This network will provide insights into the molecular mechanisms resulting in the activation of cellular responses identified in Aim 1. Aim 3. Finally, we will determine which of SRSF1's functions, splicing or translation regulation, is crucial for maintaining normal hepatocyte function. This will be achieved using mutant constructs, which have either altered splicing and/or translation regulation activities. We will introduce these constructs to SRSF1 HKO livers in vivo and perform similar assays described in Aim 1. Results of these experiments will be compared to determine the contributions of SRSF1's splicing and translation regulatory functions in maintaining liver homeostasis."
"9483603","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will investigate microglial involvement in cognitive impairment after surgery and general anesthesia. Cognitive impairment is prevalent and persistent in older surgical patients and associated with higher morbidity and cost. The cause is unknown but CNS inflammation is implicated. Microglia, the resident immune competent cells of the CNS, are major effectors of CNS inflammation, but until recently it was difficult to distinguish between resident microglia and myeloid cells that infiltrate the CNS durin stress because there were no known microglia specific genes encoding cell surface proteins. This is critical because resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages have separate and distinct immune functions. We propose a transcriptome / proteomincs / bioinformatics approach using a recently discovered unique molecular signature for microglia to investigate age-dependent microglia biology during and after surgery and anesthesia. Using such tools, we found there are fewer microglia in the old brain, that they express lower levels of immune-related and homeostatic genes, and that isoflurane anesthesia affects microglia in young vs. old mice differently. Based on these data, we propose microglial attrition and dysregulation in the old CNS are responsible for vulnerability to cognitive impairment after surgery and that surgery. Here we will identify the impact of surgery and general anesthesia on the molecular and functional signature of microglia; investigate the contribution of microglia to postoperative CNS inflammation and cognitive impairment using microglial ablation / replenishment; and rescue age-dependent cognitive vulnerability to surgery and anesthesia by immunomodulating microglia. Upon completion of the project, we will understand age differences in the molecular and functional properties of microglia, the role of resident microglia vs. infiltrating myeloid cels in surgery- induced CNS inflammation and cognitive decline, and how general anesthesia affects the process and defined a strategy for specifically targeting microglia to restore their homeostatic molecular signature, reduce CNS inflammation, and improve postoperative cognitive outcome in older subjects. Importantly, we will also specifically target microglia to restore their homeostatic molecular signature in order to reduce CNS inflammation and improve postoperative cognitive outcome. The work proposed is innovative because it uses state-of- the art methods and technology to explore a novel microglial mechanism for postoperative cognitive decline in older patients and significant because of the scale of the clinical problem and potential to identify new ways of preventing it."

This partnership will bring together the resources of major medical centers committed to T1D research and clinical care to reach more of the estimated 100,000 individuals with T1D in the Chicagoland area (about 0.8% of the area population) and their families, as well as the 2000 projected new cases of T1D and their families each year. This outreach will involve diverse communities from some of the wealthiest to some of the most underserved in the United States. We will build on our success in creating the largest database for monogenic diabetes in the United States. We will engage the greater Chicagoland community through innovative social media and direct communications combining media support, direct visits to local practices, community events supported by our institutions and partners and outreach to large networks of faith communities. The University of Chicago has been committed to diabetes research for over 100 years, and together with Advocate Children's Hospital and other partners we will bring a new sense of energy, organization, and purpose to TrialNet recruitment and screening in the Chicagoland region."
"9495034","Project Summary  Skin works as more than a physical barrier. It also functions as an organ mounting the immune responses against harmful stimulations and invading microorganisms of the environment. However, advanced wound dressings have been studied primarily for wound closure through mechanisms such as vascularization, epithelialization, contraction, infection control or their combinations. No dressings have been studied with two primary functions of promoting both wound closure and immune homeostasis. Our recent results (Nature Immunology 2016) have shown that CCR10 (+) innate lymphoid cells are important for cutaneous homeostatic regulation, suggesting that the CCL27/CCR10 axis is a promising target in manipulating immune cells for skin homeostasis. Thus, the objective of this project is to study a novel semi-synthetic biomaterial for controlled release of CCL27 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). CCL27 will be used to promote immune homeostasis and VEGF will be used to promote wound closure. To achieve this objective, this biomaterial will be functionalized with aptamers. The use of aptamers is promising to solve a challenging contradictory situation where high permeability is necessary for efficient transport of oxygen and drugs to the wound bed but it limits sustained drug release. The preliminary results have demonstrated that highly permeable materials functionalized with aptamers can release VEGF in a sustained manner for accelerated wound closure. Based on these compelling preliminary data, the proposed research is aimed at testing a novel hypothesis that aptamer-mediated release of VEGF and CCL27 will promote both wound closure and immune homeostasis to restore the key functions of the skin. Specific aims include 1) synthesis and characterization of the semi- synthetic wound dressing; 2) evaluation of the functions of the dressing in regulating immune cells and promoting wound closure at the tissue, cellular and molecular levels; and 3) evaluation of the repaired skin against harmful stimulations. Skin wounds constitute a major public health problem, affecting more than 7.7 million people in the U.S. every year. The success of this project will open a new avenue of developing wound dressings, improve the quality of the lives of patients and reduce the heavy socioeconomic burden of skin wounds."

"9525222","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ability of older adults to perform routine daily activities is compromised by the loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia) and reduced power, and the problem is exacerbated by the development of muscle fatigue. This proposal will address these issues by studying fatigue induced by dynamic contractions in older men and women (= 70 years). We take a translational approach by examining the mechanisms of fatigue from dynamic contractions of single fibers (from muscle biopsies), whole muscle (magnetic resonance spectroscopy, MRS) and within the neuromuscular system (using transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS). The hypothesis is that older adults fatigue more rapidly than young adults during dynamic contractions due to age-related inefficiencies inherent to skeletal muscle fiber (peripheral fatigue) rather than greater fatigue in the central nervous system (central fatigue). Our experimental design includes a comprehensive study of both men and women to examine sex differences. This is particularly important given the realization that fatigability in older women has received minimal attention despite the greater vulnerability to older women. A secondary goal is to test a novel exercise paradigm in protecting older adults from fatigue. The hypothesis is that training with slow six second shortening and six second lengthening contractions at velocities and forces known to elicit peak power will improve whole muscle and body performance, muscle fiber size and function in older adults to a greater extent than traditional high resistance (80% of one repletion maximum) contractions. In Aim 1, we will study single fibers obtained by needle biopsy from the vastus lateralis muscle to compare single fiber function, economy and fatigue in young and old sedentary men and women, and old late-life exercisers (exercisers for ~the last 10 years) and old life-long exercise groups. Our hypothesis is that fiber function in older adults is compromised mainly during dynamic contractions by a reduced peak power, rate of tension development, and economy, while isometric force is well maintained. Our preliminary data also suggests that muscle fibers from older adults are more sensitive to the fatiguing effects of low pH and high inorganic phosphate. We expect fast fibers to be more effected by age than slow fibers, and the functional loss to be non-exercisers>late-life exercisers>life-long exercisers. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that age-induced change in peripheral fatigue of whole muscle is increased during dynamic exercise resulting in greater muscle fatigue compared with young adults. We will use TMS to assess fatigue in the whole muscle and to show that central fatigue does not differ with age for dyanmic fatiguing contractions. In Aim 3, we will test the effectiveness of the novel exercise training and the hypothesis that it will improve whole body tasks, whole muscle and single fiber performance (peak power and metabolism), and resistance to fatigue. Muscle biopsies, TMS and MRS will be performed before and after training. These outcomes will provide important new information that will translate into clinically important exercise programs to improve quality of life and reduce health care costs with aging."

"9566970","Aging is the major risk factor for Alzheimer?s disease (AD), leading to cellular and functional changes within the brain that culminate in dementia and cognitive decline. Lessening or reversing brain aging may delay Alzheimer?s disease onset or even protect against Alzheimer?s pathogenesis, having a large effect on quality of life and health burden imposed by AD. This proposal tests the hypothesis that young plasma reverses hippocampal decline in plasticity and learning/memory in the aged brain through regulation of transcriptional programs, including gene networks involving Alzheimer?s pathogenesis. TIMP2 is a key blood-borne factor enriched in young plasma that enhances hippocampal Activator-protein 1 (AP-1) and other plasticity markers, while reversing hippocampal cognitive decline in aged mice. Experiments will examine young plasma-mediated and TIMP2-mediated enhancement of AP-1, a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in hippocampal function, including MMPs that are intimately tied to amyloid-? metabolism. I will investigate the role of TIMP2 in mediating transcriptional changes in plasticity and Alzheimer?s-related genes in the aged hippocampus and the extent to which TIMP2 is a necessary factor for the beneficial effects conferred by young plasma. The mechanism by which TIMP2 improves hippocampal function, including its site of action, duration of its transcriptional control, and the effect of long-term increased TIMP2 activity on limiting cognitive decline in aged mice will be investigated.  The results may inform therapies directed at restoring TIMP2 function as a treatment for Alzheimer?s disease.  To fully characterize transcriptional changes induced by both young plasma and blood-borne TIMP2, Aim 1 will use next-generation sequencing methods (RNA-seq and ChIP-seq) in aged hippocampal tissue from mice treated systemically with young plasma, TIMP2, or control. ChIP-seq will be performed to identify all genes bound and regulated by AP-1 following treatment. Aim 2 assesses the necessity of TIMP2 for the cognitive improvements and transcriptional changes (identified in Aim 1) mediated by young plasma. Mice treated with young plasma will be compared to those receiving TIMP2-depleted (or KO) plasma or control. Aim 3 examines TIMP2?s site of action for improvements in aged hippocampal function (peripheral vs central) using a neutralization approach. The duration of TIMP2?s transcriptional regulation following treatment and the transcriptional and cognitive consequences of long-term peripheral TIMP2 expression using a viral-mediated approach will be pursued. Together, these aims critically assess the role of systemic TIMP2 in reversing hippocampal cognitive decline as a means to limit the impact of Alzheimer?s disease."
"9608304","Abstract: The glucocorticoid-type steroids are the mainstay of asthma therapy. A subgroup of asthmatic patients develops steroid resistance, which becomes a major therapeutic challenge and imposes a high cost to the society. An understanding the mechanism of steroid resistance is important. Asthma is driven by the type 2 immune response. Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are an important source of type 2 cytokines. Two epithelial cytokines?IL33 and TSLP promote the development and function of ILC2s. We have recently reported that airway ILC2s, as compared to blood ILC2s, from a subgroup of asthmatic patients are steroid resistant in a TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin)-dependent manner. Blood ILC2s become steroid resistant when exposed to TSLP but not IL33. We have uncovered a mechanism for this dichotomous effect. Steroids upregulate (protagonize) the receptors for TSLP but not IL33. By upregulating the receptors steroids lower their activation threshold. Steroids still antagonize many inflammatory pathways in these cells but, surprisingly, protagonize the pathways that directly interfere with the formation of the glucocorticoid receptor repressor complex. Consequently, these pathways upregulate type 2 cytokines unabated in the presence of steroids, which results in steroid resistance. Based upon these findings we hypothesize that activation of steroid protagonized receptors induces steroid resistance through upregulation of select signaling pathways that disrupt the formation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) repressor complex. We propose 3 specific aims to test the foregoing hypothesis. Under specific aim 1 we will study the molecular mechanism of TSLP-induced steroid resistance of ILC2s. We will examine how a novel signaling pathway involving MEK2-CBX7-PRC1, identified in preliminary experiments, hinders the organization of the GR repressor complex. We will use human blood and lung ILC2s to maintain human disease relevance. Specific aim 2 is devoted to mechanistic and preclinical studies in mice. We will examine how repetitive exposure to allergens and rhinovirus contributes to the development of steroid resistance. We will use genetically modified mice to validate the importance of steroid resistant pathways. We will perform preclinical trials with pathway inhibitors in a humanized mouse model of steroid resistant asthma. Under specific aim 3 we will establish the relevance of TSLP and TSLPR signaling molecules for steroid resistance by studying bronchoalveolar lavage ILCs and T cells from steroid resistant and steroid sensitive asthmatic patients. We will evaluate pathway inhibitors for reversal of steroid resistance of airway lymphoid cells. We have all the necessary expertise, resources and collaborators to accomplish this project. The proposal is important because it addresses an unresolved clinical problem that affects not only asthma but also many chronic inflammatory, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases where steroid resistance is a therapeutic challenge. A successful completion of this project will help develop novel therapeutic modalities targeting steroid resistance, in general."

"9472998","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although anticholinesterase therapies have greatly improved the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), they have not been demonstrated to significantly slow the disease progression; and amyloid- directed therapies have produced disappointing results. A promising evidence-based and relatively side-effect free lifestyle approach is emerging as an alternative or adjunct to drug therapy. In cross-section and prospective studies, and a few randomized controlled trials; aerobic exercise-training has been demonstrated to improve cognition in older subjects. However, the mechanisms of these effects remain poorly understood. Because it is now recognized that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks can catalyze AD development, it is vital to test whether lifestyle adaptation shown to reduce CVD risks can favorably modify cognitive trajectories and markers of neurodegeneration. Such interventions may benefit those at an early and clinically discernible prodromal stage of AD such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Notably, such data are currently lacking in African Americans (AA)s who harbor higher rate of CVD risks and AD. For ~10 years, the Principal Investigator has conducted studies on the effects of fitness adaptation on cardiovascular (CV) health. Recently, he received 2 years of funding to examine the effects of 3-times/week 6-month aerobic exercise-training on cognition in the laboratory setting. This ongoing study has allowed the Principal Investigator to demonstrate the ability to recruit, enroll, test, collect and manage related neuroimaging pilot data in a predominantly AA sample. While such a laboratory approach to exercise intervention study is required to prove causation, such a design may not lend itself to real-life application, and is demanding for many economically and educationally disadvantaged older AAs experiencing early symptoms of cognitive deterioration. To logically extend this ongoing work, he seeks to initiate an 18-month study, testing real-life applicability o the effects of exercise adaptation on memory in a more ideal community setting. Collection of outcome measures at baseline, 3- month, 6-month, 9-month, 12-month and 18-month will provide pilot data to inform dose and duration effects of exercise on outcome measures. In addition to augmenting enrollments, the proposed approach will bolster retention. The objectives of this pilot study, therefore, are to examine the feasibility of a community-based 18-month study (6-month active intervention and 12-month passive follow-up) aerobic exercise-training on neurodegeneration in AAs MCI subjects. We will test our hypotheses by randomizing subjects into one of 2 groups: 1.) aerobic-exercise; and 2.) stretch-exercise (control). We proposed that the aerobic-exercise group will perform better than control group on cognitive measures. Secondarily, we will determine whether training- induced changes in cognition relate to increases in brain volume. Explanatorily, we will also investigate intervention effects on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, selected CVD risk factors and biomarkers, cerebral oxygenation and Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIF-1?) gene expression, and Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), to assess their mediation of training-induced changes in cognition. A team of experienced investigators in neuroimaging, neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and exercise physiology has been assembled to conduct this study. Working collaboratively with the District of Columbia Office on Aging (DCOA), the Directors of the Ward 6 Senior Wellness Center operated by DCOA, and the lead agencies on aging (community grassroots organizations supported by DCOA), we will recruit, enroll, randomize, and train participants at the wellness center. After obtaining informed consent and completing an initial assessment, participants will undergo initial exercise screening to determine their ability to exercise safely. Following randomization of 80 volunteers into aerobic-exercise (40) and control (40); baseline neuropsychological, neuroimaging and biomarker measurements will be obtained. Both groups will undergo 3 times/week supervised group-specific intervention at the wellness center for 6 months. After the initial 6 months of active intervention, the aerobic-exercise group will follow a  prescribed but free living 40 minutes, 3 time/week exercise regimen, while the control group returns to usual care. Baseline tests will be repeated at 3 month, after 6 months (active intervention period); and at 9, 12 and 18 months (passive follow-up period). Treadmill, lumber puncture (LP) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests will occur only at baseline and 6 months. Between groups changes in cognitive performance, biomarkers, and neuroimaging measurements will be compared using appropriate multivariate methods. While we remain cognizant of other planned or ongoing fitness and memory trial, the proposed study is unique in the sense that: it is a logical extension of our ongoing work; tests the proposed hypotheses in predominantly AA sample in whom paucity of data remains, and therefore, will advance reduction in health disparity; will obtain data at multiple time-points (baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 8 months) and therefore allow for the assessments of the effects of duration and dose of intervention on outcome measures; test the real-life applicability of the proposed intervention in a community setting; and generate pilot data on the mechanisms by which these interventions affects memory. Importantly, outcomes from this study may lead to practical and effective strategy to delay cognitive decline in populations at most risk, and can prevent or attenuate the physical, psychological and the economic burden associated with dementia in AAs."
"9601369","Abstract Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder that is the leading genetic cause of infantile death, occurring in ~1:6,000 live births. The gene responsible for SMA is called survival motor neuron-1 (SMN1). SMN2 is nearly identical to SMN1, however, mutations in SMN2 have no clinical consequence if SMN1 is retained. The reason why SMN2 cannot prevent disease development in the absence of SMN1 is that the majority of SMN2-derived transcripts are alternatively spliced, resulting in a truncated and unstable protein. While increasing SMN levels may be sufficient for many forms of SMA, an effective treatment regimen for the breadth of the clinical SMA spectrum may require a combinatorial approach that includes ?SMN-independent? approaches to address the complexity of the disease. SMN-independent therapeutics can be envisioned as a means to augment an SMN-associated function or compensate for a secondary defect/pathway, each of which would not necessarily require an increase in SMN protein levels. Consistent with this notion, two compounds have entered clinical trials for SMA that are mechanistically distinct from the potential therapeutics that increase SMN: a neuroprotectant being developed by Roche (Olesoxime); and a skeletal muscle activator being developed by Cytokinetics (CK-2127107) (10, 11). Going forward, novel SMN-independent targets for drug development will likely play an important role in treating SMA, and genetic modifiers of SMA are a likely source for SMN-independent drug targets. The objective of this proposal is to identify SMN-independent modifiers of disease as a means to identify functional and druggable targets for SMA."

"9474216","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year in the US, severe TBI in children results in <7400 deaths and 60 000 hospitalizations. Fifty percent of surviving children with severe TBI have poor neurological outcome at six months. Severe TBI in children is thus a critical problem in desperate need of impactful therapies. Free radicals and oxidative stress have been accepted as universal pathogenic mechanisms of TBI prompting the therapeutic use of antioxidants. Invariably, the clinical trials of non-specific free radical scavengers/antioxidants failed. Unless the true sources and mechanisms of TBI redox imbalance are identified, the use of sacrificial antioxidants and free radical scavengers will fail. Thus, a paradigm-shifting approach is required. During prior funding period, we discovered that selective peroxidation of a mitochondria-specific phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL), occurs in severe pediatric TBI and represents a required mitochondrial stage of neuronal apoptosis. We further identified cytochrome c (cyt c) as a catalyst of CL peroxidation occurring via the formation of cyt c/CL complexes with peroxidase activity triggered by H2O2 . Thus cyt c/CL redox interactions and CL peroxidation represent a missing causal link between known reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial pro-apoptotic responses. Importantly, our preliminary data show that a mitochondria-targeted small molecule inhibitor of CL peroxidation suppressed TBI-induced apoptosis in vivo and preserved cognitive function in postnatal day (PND) 17 rats. In normal mitochondria, CL and cyt c are physically separated: CL is confined almost exclusively to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Binding of cyt c with CL depends on the collapse of CL asymmetry and translocation of CL to the outer mitochondrial membrane. While the mechanisms of collapse of CL asymmetry are poorly understood, preliminary data show that two candidate proteins - nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK-D) and phospholipid scramblase-3 (PLSCR3) -facilitate CL translocation. Our hypothesis is that collapse of CL asymmetry and formation of cyt c/CL peroxidase complexes trigger - in the presence of H2O2 - CL peroxidation and release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria in immature brain after TBI. Thus, maintaining CL asymmetry and suppression of peroxidase activity will improve neuronal survival and outcome after TBI. To test our hypothesis and its successful translation, we will employ multi-disciplinary approach combining in vitro (mechanical stretch injury of neurons) and in vivo (controlled cortical impact in PND17 rats) TBI models, biochemical (oxidative lipidomics) and biophysical (new protocols for assessment of asymmetry and externalization of CL in mitochondria) methodology, genetic and pharmacological approaches as well as computational modeling and organic chemical synthesis. These studies will provide important mechanistic information on the role of CL asymmetry and oxidation in neuronal apoptosis after TBI. The ability to selectively modulate CL oxidation, a critical early event in apoptosis, could lead to targeted therapies for TBI and ultimately improve outcome for children after brain injury."
"9477578","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes (T1D) occurs in genetically predisposed individuals as a result of the progressive, selective destruction of pancreatic ?-cells, which is primarily mediated by autoreactive T cells. The disease process results in loss of insulin secretion and life-long insulin-dependence, and unfortunately, most often occurs in children, adolescents, and young adults. Years later, these individuals are at risk of developing chronic complications, which can be severely debilitating and life-threatening. The process of ?-cell destruction begins long before clinical disease onset and continues after development of hyperglycemia; at the time of diagnosis subjects retain a significant amount of ?-cell function as measured by C-peptide responses to a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). However, ?-cell function continues to deteriorate after diagnosis with the presumed eventuality of near complete loss of secretion over time. At present there is no treatment that fully interdicts islet autoimmunity. However, clinical trials have shown promising results, demonstrating that it is possible to interfere with islet autoimmunity and preserve C-peptide secretion for at least some time. Diabetes TrialNet is a consortium of international researchers, NIH-funded, investigating interventions for the prevention or delay of type 1 diabetes. As a TrialNet Clinical Center our long-term scientific goals are to contribute to the overarching goals of TrialNet: develop a better understanding of the natural history and molecular basis of T1D and implement clinical trials evaluating new strategies to prevent this disease. The objective of this proposal, a step in pursuit of these goals, is to remain an active participant in the research network, Type 1 diabetes TrialNet, and in the process of designing and implementing new prevention strategies. Each investigative step taken toward modulating the destructive process that leads to T1D moves us closer to the ultimate goal of prevention."

"9508003","Abstract: The mechanisms by which neural stem cells in the embryonic brain divide and generate daughter cells to build the cerebral cortex of the proper size and structure remain among the most compelling mysteries in biology and medicine. How these long, polarized cells split to produce two daughters with symmetric or asymmetric fates, while still maintaining the epithelial structure, remains unclear despite much progress. Proper mitosis (chromosome segregation) and cytokinesis (cytoplasm, organelle, and membrane segregation) of neural stem cells is essential for their proliferation and survival. Indeed, neural stem cells trigger apoptosis more easily than mature neurons or other dividing cell types. Yet how apoptosis is triggered and how it can be prevented are not understood. This proposal focuses on a specific genetic model of microcephaly in which neural stem cells appear to have difficulty with a late step of cell division (abscission), and trigger their own apoptosis. Surprisingly, the small brain size and survival of these mutant animals can be rescued by knockout of the tumor suppressor gene p53. The objective of this particular application is to elucidate how p53- dependent apoptosis is triggered in this model of microcephaly. The central hypothesis is that neural stem cells that cannot complete the last step of division of the daughters (abscission) trigger p53-dependent apoptosis. We will test this hypothesis through two Specific Aims: 1) determine the temporal and causal relationship between cytokinetic abscission defects and p53 activation in NSCs, and 2) elucidate this novel pathway of p53 activation. Our long-term goal is to elucidate how specific alterations in cell division mechanisms in neural stem cells during development can lead to variations in brain size and structure, malformations, or other disorders. The contributions of the proposed research are expected to be a novel pathway for p53 activation and apoptosis, and a more detailed understanding of how cell division defects lead to brain malformations. These contributions will be significant because they may uncover novel mechanisms that contribute to neural stem cell survival or death, and make predictions about possible treatments for specific types of microcephaly or other brain malformations resulting from excess apoptosis."
"9475256","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has led to increased survival of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected patients. As a result, chronic diseases are increasingly replacing acute infections as important causes of morbidity and mortality. One of these chronic diseases is atherothrombosis, the underlying mechanisms of which are not fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that monocytes and platelets from HIV-infected, cART-treated individuals exhibit reduced levels of the host restriction factor Tetherin BST-2/CD317), and that Tetherin loss is induced by exposure of healthy cells to the viral protein Tat, and to other inflammatory mediators of cellular origin, via proteasome-dependent mechanisms. We also show that over-expression of degradation-resistant Tetherin, which contains a S3T4S5 substitution mutation, in monocytes causes sequestration of fully formed microparticles (MPs) on the cell surface. These findings will be leveraged to test the overall hypothesis that HIV promotes thrombosis via Tetherin-dependent release of cellular MPs. Briefly, we will examine the loss of Tetherin and associated release of MPs by employing in vitro models of HIV infection (Aim 1), novel mouse models of HIV-associated thrombosis in vivo (Aim 2), and prospectively determine how these events are linked in HIV patients receiving cART (Aim 3). These studies will bring together four established investigators and two emerging investigators with proven expertise in virology, platelet/monocyte biology, MPs, thrombosis, and HIV clinical research. Importantly, proposed studies will leverage research infrastructure offered by the University of Rochester Center for AIDS Research (UR-CFAR). Our studies contain great potential for clinical translation. Changes in Tetherin expression will be directly tested in human subjects and linked with atherothrombosis. As such, revealing the mechanisms through which HIV and cART regulate the production of microparticles in monocytes and platelets will provide a critical basic science foundation so as to understand how these molecular pathways function in mammalian cells, while providing insight into how HIV triggers atherothrombotic events in patients who are or are not receiving cART. In summary, our proposal is discovery-oriented, translational, and is responsive to the goals of RFA (RFA-HL- 14-024)."

Recent preclinical studies suggest that heterogeneity in AAV vector preparations, including the presence of defective interfering particles with partial or truncated genomes contribute to such undesirable side effects. Although somewhat resolvable with anti-inflammatory drug regimens, permanent loss of gene expression has been reported. We postulate that improvements to AAV vector design and composition are likely to improve the safety profile. To achieve the latter goals, a better understanding of particle heterogeneity in AAV vectors packaging different genomes as well as the impact of such on AAV biology is essential. In the current proposal, we will first advance a potentially disruptive technology, charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) to help map the mass landscape of vector compositions associated with genome packaging. We will then bridge this basic information with new directions in AAV capsid engineering with the goal of improving compositional homogeneity and reducing the potential for side effects. Each aim is tailored to directly interrogate the proposed correlation between the composition of recombinant vectors with viral infectivity in cell culture as well as gene transfer efficiency and toxicity in mouse models. We expect our efforts to (i) offer significant, new insight into parvoviral capsid-genome interactions, (ii) enable the development and validation of a novel analytical technique for rapid screening and quality testing of clinical AAV samples, and (iii) improve AAV gene transfer efficiency and safety profile through capsid engineering."
"9418045","Project Summary The Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease (CRISP) is a unique, longitudinal, observational cohort study of 241 autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients that began in 2000. The consortium consists of researchers at University of Alabama, University of Chicago, Emory University, University of Kansas Medical Center, Mayo Clinic, and University of Pittsburgh. The broad, long- term objectives of CRISP are to define the natural history of the disease and to discover prognostic biomarkers in early disease that can accurately predict long-term renal outcomes. The goals of CRISP IV are to continue follow-up of the CRISP cohort for 5 more years so as to refine models of CKD progression and strengthen the association between htTKV and renal outcomes, to validate disease models using existing and additional follow-up data from the HALT PKD study, and to incorporate powerful emerging imaging, genetic and biochemical biomarkers to improve the accuracy of prognostication for individual patients. To achieve this, the specific aims are: Aim 1. Continue follow-up of CRISP and HALT participants. All CRISP participants that have not reached ESRD, together with HALT Study A participants followed at CRISP sites, will be followed up with annual serum creatinine measurements. Aim 2. Develop improved models to predict GFR trajectories and progression to ESRD. Existing logistic regression and trajectory models will be refined and new approaches such as artificial neural network and classification tree models developed, using CRISP data for model fitting and HALT-A data for external validation. Aim 3. Develop novel imaging, biochemical and genetic biomarkers of disease progression. Highly promising new biomarkers that are emerging from ancillary studies or being developed in parallel ongoing studies at the CRISP centers, will be evaluated for their ability to improve the accuracy of prognostic models."
"9563964","PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT Although the pathological hallmarks of AD, such as axonal transport defects, synaptic loss, and selective neuronal death, are well-characterized, the underlying mechanisms that cause AD are largely unknown, thereby making it difficult to design effective therapies. Although the majority of AD patients are sporadic, several genetic risk variants have been identified. Variation in the Apoplioprotein E (ApoE) gene, a lipoprotein transporter involved in cholesterol metabolism, has been identified as the most powerful and prevalent of these risk factors. Specifically, compared to the referent variant ?3 allele, individuals with one or two ?4 alleles have a 3- or 12-fold higher probability of developing AD, respectively. On the other hand, the ?2 allele reduces patient risk for AD by nearly 50%. Amyloid-dependent and -independent mechanisms have been postulated to explain the risk inducing ApoE4 effect, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which ApoE2 reduces AD disease risk remain unclear. Current studies to examine the neuroprotective effect of ApoE2 have been limited to (i) rodent models, which while have provided valuable information in understanding AD, but do not recapitulate all aspects of the human disease and (ii) neuronal cells from cadaveric tissue samples which are limited in supply and rapidly loose disease-related phenotypes upon extensive in vitro culture. With hiPSC technology, it is possible to obtain a fully differentiated cell type (such as a skin cell) from an AD patient and reprogram it back into a cell type that is capable of differentiating into all of the cell types of the mature, adult body (such as neural cells of the cortex). Although we have used AD hiPSC-derived neural cells to study this disease in a simplified and accessible system, our study of the effect of ApoE variants on the manifestation of AD-related phenotypes has been confounded by the variance that exists between individual patient genomes. To that end, we will use our collective experience in stem cell bioengineering, neurodegenerative disease modeling, and genome editing to elucidate potential genetic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms by which ApoE2 protects against AD onset and age-related progression. In the first aim of this proposal, we will use a novel adeno-associated virus (AAV) and CRISPR/Cas9 dual approach to efficiently generate isogenic hiPSC lines that only differ with respect to their ApoE genotype and not genetic background. In the second aim, subsequent phenotypic analysis of 3-D cortical neural cultures derived from these isogenic lines will reveal the (i) direct effect of the presence of an ?2 allele on the manifestation of AD-related phenotypes and (ii) potential signaling pathways and transcriptional targets that are independently influence by ApoE genotype and disease status. Overall, the ability to identify definitive relationships between ApoE genotype and AD-related phenotypes will have a significant translational impact on the design of molecularly targeted therapies to treat the many patients suffering from AD."
"9564051","Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE-?4) allele carriers are known to be at substantially greater risk for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, APOE-?4 allele inheritance is an imperfect predictor of who will develop clinical symptoms of the disease, suggesting that modifiable lifestyle factors such as exercise may moderate its influence on disease progression. Our team is uniquely qualified, and we have published several preliminary studies showing that physical activity may offer protection for APOE-?4 allele carriers from AD- related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Interventions, such as exercise, that even modestly delay the onset of cognitive impairment or improve cognitive function in healthy APOE-?4 carriers will have a major public health impact. It is not yet known, however, if exercise prospectively modifies the disease trajectory in healthy asymptomatic older adults who are at increased genetic risk for AD. The focus and innovative aspect of our proposal is to test the hypothesis that exercise training will improve the efficiency of neural networks during memory retrieval, increase resting cerebral blood flow, neural network connectivity, and cortical thickness, and improve episodic memory performance in APOE-?4 allele carriers. There are three key knowledge gaps regarding exercise as a primary prevention of cognitive decline in those at genetic risk for AD. First, it has not yet been firmly established that exercise improves the function and efficiency of neuronal networks during cognition, including memory retrieval, in APOE-?4 allele carriers. Second, it is unknown if the neurotrophic and increased resting cerebral blood flow effects of exercise extend to APOE-?4 allele carriers. Third, it has not been demonstrated that an exercise intervention will have lasting effects that delay cognitive decline or conversion to MCI. The novel and distinguishing feature of our proposal is to address the first two knowledge gaps with MRI and cognitive outcomes after exercise training in cognitively intact older APOE-?4 allele carriers. This pilot clinical trial will inform a future trial addressing the critical question on the long-term effects of exercise in ?4 carriers. Cognitively intact APOE-?4 allele carriers will be randomly assigned to 6-months of either supervised moderate intensity aerobic exercise training (ET) or supervised flexibility exercise control (FC). The ET and FC each contain a group based exercise component and are run in retirement communities. Our primary aims are to compare pre-intervention to post-intervention changes in 1) MRI biomarkers; and 2) episodic memory performance measured by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). We hypothesize that after ET compared to FC, brain activation during memory retrieval will be reduced, resting cerebral blood flow and functional connectivity will increase in frontal regions, and episodic memory performance will improve. Outcomes in response to the intervention will be measured at baseline and 6 months. Our famous name discrimination task has several advantages to track the effects of any intervention on neural network efficiency and activates brain regions associated with the ?default mode network?, which is known to harbor amyloid and to be disrupted with progression to AD."
"9478015","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past three decades, dietary restriction (DR) has become the gold standard against which manipulations that retard aging are compared. Because DR has been shown to increase the lifespan of a wide variety of organisms ranging from invertebrates to rodents, DR is viewed as a universal aging intervention. However, a recent study suggests that the genotype of an animal is a major determinant in the ability of the animal to respond to DR, e.g., two-thirds of the 41 recombinant inbred (RI) lines of mice studied either did not respond or showed reduced lifespan when fed 40% DR (40% less diet than that consumed by mice fed ad libitum). The overall goal of this grant is to explore the interaction between genotype and the level of DR using nine genetically diverse RI lines of mice. We hypothesize that DR will increase lifespan and delay aging in all genotypes; however, the effect of DR will be both genotype- and dose-dependent, i.e., one level of DR is not optimal for all genotypes. The comprehensive design of this study, allows us for the first time to obtain an accurate view of how genetic diversity impacts the effect of DR on lifespan and aging.  Specific Aim 1: To determine whether DR affects lifespan in a genotype- and dose-dependent manner. The lifespans of nine RI lines of female mice that show maximum diversity in response to 40% DR will be fed ad libitum or 10, 20, or 40% less diet than the amount consumed by each RI line fed ad libitum. Based on our hypothesis, we predict that all nine RI lines will show an increase in lifespan; however, the level of restriction necessary to obtain an increase in lifespan will vary with genotype.  Specific Aim 2: To determine whether DR affects end-of-life pathology in a genotype- and dose-dependent manner. Because a reduction in most age-related pathologies is a hallmark feature of DR, we will conduct a comprehensive pathological analysis of all the female mice that die in Aim 1. We predict that the increase in lifespan by DR will be accompanied by a reduction/delay in most age-related pathological lesions, which would support the premise that DR increases lifespan by retarding aging. We also predict that the effect of DR on end-of-life pathological lesions will be genotype- and DR dose-dependent.  Specific Aim 3: To identify potential pathways involved in the anti-aging mechanism of DR. We will measure the levels of transcripts in RNA isolated from liver and epididymal fat of mice fed AL and the three DR diets for 12 months using Illumina Mouse microarrays. Employing unbiased analyses of our microarray data, we will identify pathways that are altered significantly by DR. Because we will have transcriptome data on 27 cohorts of mice fed DR (nine strains of mice fed 10, 20, and 40% DR), we are in a unique position to identify gene profiles that have the greatest predictive power to identify the cohorts of mice that show a significant increase in lifespan when placed on a DR diet, and from these data, we can identify potential mechanisms key in the life-extending action DR."
"9599914","The productive phase of the HPV life cycle is restricted to the uppermost layer of the epithelium, in cells that have normally exited the cell cycle. The E7 protein alters cell cycle regulation to push differentiating cells back into the cell cycle, allowing for productive replication and virion production in a G2-arrested environment. Unscheduled cell cycle re-entry, while necessary for viral replication, results in replication stress that can lead to genomic instability, contributing to cancer development. E7 is able to bypass senescence, a stable growth arrest associated with replication stress, by targeting the Rb tumor suppressor for degradation. Our long-term goal is to identify signaling pathways that regulate viral replication in order to understand the mechanisms by which HPV persists and causes cancer. This proposal focuses on understanding how HPV hijacks the ATR DNA damage pathway to facilitate viral replication. We will identify the mechanisms by which HPV utilizes ATR and its downstream target Chk1 to increase the levels of RRM2, a key component in nucleotide synthesis that is necessary for viral replication. We will also determine if ATR activity is required for survival of HPV-infected cells in response to E7-induced replication stress. We hypothesize that high-risk HPV positive cells are addicted to the replication stress-protective role ATR/Chk1/RRM2. Specific Aims to test this are: (1) To determine how HPV increases the levels of RRM2 through E7 by identifying domains in E7 necessary for increased RRM2 protein stability. We will also determine the contribution of ATR activity to the increased stability of RRM2 protein and elevated dNTP pools in HPV positive cells. (2) To determine if ATR activity protects HPV infected cells from E7- induced replication stress by using ATR, Chk1 and RRM2 inhibitors and small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and examining markers of replication stress and DNA damage on cellular, as well as viral DNA. We will also determine if the ATR-mediated increase in RRM2 is necessary for HPV to bypass oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) during the process of cellular immortalization, and to protect established HPV-infected lines from OIS by examining the effect of ATR and RRM2 depletion on cell growth arrest, senescence markers, and apoptosis. ATR is the central regulator of genome stability in response to replication stress. Understanding how ATR activity promotes the viral life cycle will provide insight into mechanisms of viral persistence, as well as genomic instability. These studies may also identify therapeutic targets for the treatment of HPV-associated diseases."

"9584951","Project Summary/Abstract An estimated 2.3 billion people live at risk of infection by the Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes microcephaly in newborns, as well as eye- and neurological defects, and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. Zika co-circulates in the same geographical region with the four serotypes of Dengue virus, which is of concern for both Dengue and Zika vaccine development. Antibodies that develop in response to Dengue can enhance Zika infection, and vice versa (Antibody-Dependent Enhancement, ADE). A recently discovered class of antibodies has been found to exhibit less ADE; these antibodies broadly and potently neutralize Zika and all four Dengue serotypes, and do so by binding to a quaternary epitope at the interface between adjacent E glycoprotein subunits on the viral envelope. This envelope dimer epitope (EDE) is a promising target for vaccine development. The goal of this exploratory R21 project is to discover glycopeptides that are good structural mimics of the EDE on ZIKV. Such molecules, when used as vaccine immunogens, should stimulate a broadly neutralizing antibody response that is protective against ZIKV, while avoiding ADE effects. The Krauss lab will use its directed evolution technology to scaffold the carbohydrate and peptide components of the EDE into arrangements that enable strong recognition by EDE antibodies, producing EDE mimics. Two further types of studies will then determine which among these glycopeptide ?hits? are best for future immunogenicity studies. The Sarathy and Barrett labs with determine whether selected glycopeptides compete with ZIKV for binding to the EDE antibodies, whereas the Wilson lab will determine structures of glycopeptide-antibody complexes to determine whether glycopeptides bind to the antibodies through ZIKV-like contacts."
"9613065","NTRK fusions lead to the expression of oncogenic chimeric TRK proteins with constitutively activated kinases, similar to ALK and ROS1 fusions. Most importantly, NTRK fusions are highly actionable in the clinic. First- generation TRK kinase inhibition (larotrectinib) results in rapid and durable histology-agnostic responses, with an objective response rate of 76% across a wide variety of solid tumors (Drilon et al., NEJM, provisionally accepted). Despite these impressive results, little is known about the biology of NTRK fusions, and resistance to 1st-generation therapy ultimately develops. While 2nd-generation inhibitors address on-target resistance, the development of acquired resistance to these drugs likewise represents a challenge. The main objectives of this proposal are to elucidate signaling pathways that mediate the activation and transformative capacity of TRK fusion proteins, and to identify mechanisms of intrinsic or acquired resistance to TRK inhibitors. For this project, we plan to leverage (1) our leadership in ongoing TRK inhibitor clinical trials, (2) our prior experience in identifying and characterizing resistance mechanisms to targeted therapy, and (3) our creation of a multidisciplinary ?TRK team? of scientists, pathologists, and clinicians to study TRK biology. In order to shed light on signaling pathways and/or gene expression patterns that mediate TRK fusion kinase activity, we will perform an unbiased global proteomic/transcriptomic screening using patient-derived models treated with 1st- or 2nd-generation TRK inhibitors. Candidate proteins/pathways involved in TRK-mediated tumorigenesis will be validated both genetically and pharmacologically. To determine mechanisms of resistance to 1st-generation (larotrectinib and entrectinib) and 2nd-generation (LOXO-195 and TPX-0005) inhibitors in the clinic, we will perform comprehensive characterization of paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies from patients with NTRK-rearranged solid tumors treated at our institution. Tumors will be characterized by targeted capture-based exome sequencing (MSK-IMPACT), anchored multiplex PCR (MSK Archer Solid Tumor Panel), and pan-TRK IHC; in addition, serial plasma profiling (ddPCR and hybrid capture) will be performed in patients on TRK inhibitor therapy. Building on our prior identification of convergent, on-target resistance (solvent-front mutations), we identified off-target resistance mediated by MAPK pathway reactivation (NRAS/BRAF/GNAS mutations) that may be amenable to combination therapy. For 2nd-generation inhibitor resistance, we have already identified a novel compound NTRK mutation. These efforts will be complemented by the routine creation of NTRK-rearranged patient-derived cell lines and xenografts, and engineered models (transduced primary cell lines/CRISPR-modified). In addition to exploring downstream signaling as previously described, therapeutic strategies will be explored in vitro and in vivo for both on-target resistance (2nd-generation TKI switching), and off-target resistance (combination therapy, e.g. TRK and MEK inhibition). When feasible, candidate strategies will then be explored in the clinic."
"9505295","PROJECT SUMMARY Influenza virus is an important human pathogen that can cause severe disease and death in humans. Highly pathogenic influenza viruses, such as H5N1, induce excessive host responses that are associated with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the recruitment of innate immune cells, and a diminished adaptive immune response. Unfortunately, the host and viral proteins involved in this pathogenic response are largely unknown. Accordingly, elucidating the mechanisms that underlie the host response to influenza virus is critical and will provide a framework for the rational design of new therapeutics for the treatment of pathogenic influenza infection. Genetic variation of the host can significantly influence the outcome of infection. In humans, polymorphisms in interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) cause a predisposition to severe influenza disease, highlighting their importance in the pathogenesis of influenza. To identify additional host factors that modulate influenza disease, we took advantage of the increased susceptibility of the A/J mouse strain to highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus. Using a series of C57BL/6 mice harboring individual chromosomes from the A/J strain, we identified a single chromosome that increased the observed susceptibility to highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus relative to control animals. The increased susceptibility in the parent consomic strain was associated with higher viral loads in the lungs as well as increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are hallmarks of a severe H5N1 infection in humans. This proposal is aimed at (1) identifying the host factor that modulates virus replication and increased lethality after H5N1 virus infection and (2) determining the mechanism by which the identified factor exacerbates the disease. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lead to the identification of a novel host factor associated with severe disease."
"9526545","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) produces progressive motor and cognitive impairments leading to dementia in ~75% of patients after 10 years. Development of therapies to slow PD progression requires validated biomarkers of pathologic processes and that predict progression. Such biomarkers could reflect regional pathophysiology and disruption of local or widely distributed networks that cause behavioral deficits. This project focuses on cross- sectional and longitudinal relationships among proteinopathy, cholinergic deficits, disruption of functional connectivity networks and behavior. We will build upon our findings in a single site longitudinal cohort of 270 people with PD and controls to extend and expand a multimodal approach to determine the time course of biomarker changes that correspond with and predict cognitive decline in PD. We have the potential to provide in vivo neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers of pathology and pathophysiology that could independently, or in combination, predict clinical manifestations in PD. We will combine PiB (an A? amyloid imaging agent) and VAT (a vesicular cholinergic transport ligand) PET, CSF protein levels and resting state functional connectivity analyses (rs-fcMRI using advanced analysis methods) measures of pathophysiology with sophisticated behavioral measures focusing on cognition and postmortem brain analyses including quantification of pathologic proteins. We will determine the relationships between PET biomarkers and CSF proteinopathy, and compare these to clinical manifestations. Rs-fcMRI, as a measure of brain function, will link brain pathology and neurochemistry with the associated clinical manifestations. In this manner, we will develop a strong mechanistic understanding of changes in these neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers and how this relates to cognitive decline and dementia in PD. This project holds great promise for identifying pathophysiological biomarkers for prediction of PD progression, patient stratification for trials and evaluation of new treatments."
"9697465","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Norepinephrine (NE) provides excitatory drive onto midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons and modulates responses to dopaminergic drugs, including psychostimulants. Chronic loss of noradrenergic tone impairs DA neuron firing and DA release, leading to compensatory alterations in postsynaptic DA receptor signaling and a paradoxical hypersensitivity to dopaminergic drugs. The goal of this proposal is to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the behavioral hypersensitivity to cocaine following chronic inhibition of the NE biosynthetic enzyme, dopamine ?ydroxylase (DBH). Based on our preliminary data, we propose that a chronic loss of NE produces a decrease in ?rrestin2 (?r2) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which promotes a reversal in the valence of D2 responses from inhibitory to excitatory, potentially via a G?to-G?switch in D2 receptor coupling. In Aim 1, we will determine the consequences of increasing or reducing the amount of ?r2 selectively in D1 or D2 NAc neurons on behavioral responses to D2 agonist and cocaine. We will also test whether decreasing NAc neuron excitability normalizes cocaine responses following chronic DBH inhibition. In Aim 2, we will use slice electrophysiology to determine whether decreasing ?r2 specifically in D1 or D2 NAc neurons is necessary and sufficient to trigger the switch from D2-mediated inhibition to excitation and further investigate alterations in D2 G protein coupling. In Aim 3, we will assess the effects of chronic DBH inhibition and reduction of ?r2 on the aversive properties of cocaine using the runway model of cocaine self-administration in rats. Completion of these Specific Aims will contribute to our understanding of noradrenergic modulation of mesolimbic DA transmission, the plasticity of DA receptor signaling pathways, and NE-DA interactions underlying aversive responses to drugs of abuse."
"9605480","Abstract: Towards a Wireless Implantable Intracranial Ultrasound (wICUS) Imaging System Brain imaging is crucial in detection of congenital abnormalities in anatomical brain structures, for instance in hydrocephalus, brain masses, determining the presence or severity of hemorrhage in the brain, assessment of brain damage, inflammation or trauma, status of brain tumors before, during, and after surgical removal or chemotherapy and many other emerging applications. Computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been the major brain imaging modalities so far. However, because of their dependency upon ionizing radiation and very strong magnetic field, respectively, their exposure limits and requirement of sophisticated, costly, and delicate equipment plus slow and time consuming procedures are not likely to abate anytime soon. Therefore, there is an ever-growing search for new imaging modalities that would be more cost-effective, smaller and more portable, higher resolution, and even continuous. Ultrasound is one of the most widely used medical diagnostic imaging modalities, which is broadly used to image and characterize soft tissue and blood flow at various depths and resolutions. Despite all this, except in infants, it has largely shied away from the brain, predominantly because of the poor penetration of ultrasonic waves through the bone, into and out of the adult skull at imaging frequencies. We propose to take the first steps in changing the status quo by creating a ?wireless Implantable Intracranial Ultrasound (wICUS) imaging system,? which will be located inside the cranial cavity, above dura matter, bypassing the skull bone attenuation and distortion, as in intra-operative ultrasound, but it will provide on-demand imaging capability over time and post-operation on awake and ambulatory patients until its removal. We will create a stack of a highly miniaturized 2D ultrasonic transducer array on a system-on-a-chip (SoC) integrated circuit carrying all the necessary interface electronics, wireless power, and data transmission coils and antennas, needed to operate from inside the cranial cavity, under the skull, packaged in the form of a planar implant about the size of a quarter. wICUS will be located above dura matter, bypassing the skull bone attenuation and distortion, and powered wirelessly through an efficient resonant-based 3-coil inductive link across the scalp and skull in the industrial scientific medical (ISM) band, capable of safely delivering up to 100 mW over the period of imaging (5~30min). A bidirectional data link will be established with wICUS to deliver imaging configuration commands, downlink towards the implant. The uplink data from the implant to an external receiver (RF-Rx), which needs to be considerably more wideband, will use an ultra low power impulse radio transmitter (RF-Tx) in the near-field to carry the received, amplified, filtered, and digitized ultrasound echo signals in the receive (US-Rx) mode. Ultrasonic and real-time Doppler images will be constructed outside of the body representative of the anatomy and blood flow within the wICUS array?s field of view. The proposed wICUS technology can be an essential tool for understanding and analyzing physical properties and morphology of the normal and abnormal brain tissue in situ and over time, invaluable for biological, preclinical and clinical research applications."
"9624586","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA-Seq has revolutionized transcriptomics and is one of the most important high-throughput sequencing assays invented in recent years. The key computational problem is that of de novo assembly: the reconstruction of the transcripts and their abundances from tens to hundreds of millions of short reads. The problem is challenging due to a confluence of several factors: large number of different transcripts (tens of thousands), long repeat across transcripts due to alternative splicing, widely varying abundances across transcripts, and the presence of read errors. Existing assemblers are mostly designed based on heuristic considerations and implement ad hoc methods that lead to unreliable transcriptome reconstructions. An accurate RNA-Seq assembler would enable more accurate identification of fusions in cancer transcriptomes, better gene annotations in model and non-model organisms, and more complete analyses of the dynamics of alternative splicing driving developmental and regulatory programs. In this proposal, we offer a systematic approach to the design of RNA-Seq assemblers based on information theoretic principles. We start by determining conditions data that guarantee that there enough information to reconstruct the transcriptome, and then propose an assembly algorithm that can reconstruct with the minimal information. This algorithm optimally uses the available read information to resolve repeats and disambiguate isoforms. A key insight derived from the information theoretic approach is that widely varying abundances across transcripts, rather than a complication, can actually be exploited as signatures of different transcripts to disambiguate among them. Based on our initial ideas, we have built, evaluated and compared an initial prototype with several existing software, on both real and simulated data. The encouraging results provide evidence that our approach, which we will fully develop, implement and evaluated during the funded period, can significantly outperform existing software. Additional functionalities such as mixed short/long read assembly, genome-assisted assembly and joint processing of multiple RNA samples, will be designed and incorporated into the software as part of the proposed project."

The network will: (a) promote needed increases in scientific knowledge regarding the array of processes and pathways through which different ELAs (e.g., low socio-economic status [SES], stressful experiences, poor parent-child relationships, maternal nutrition and lifestyle) may similarly or differentially impact later life health and well-being, and (b) leverage evidence from (a) to promote development and evaluation of novel later-life interventions to reverse/reduce risk processes related to ELAs. Specific aims for this network will be to: (1). Build capacity to advance interdisciplinary research exploring the potential for midlife reversibility of or/compensation for risks conferred by ELA by convening biannual international, interdisciplinary meetings of researchers with expertise spanning animal and human research and a shared interest in collaborative work to: (a) foster better understanding of the life-course mechanisms/pathways linking ELA to trajectories of later life health and well-being; (b) develop and test later-life interventions to reduce or even completely reverse risks to health and well-being associated with ELA, and (c) identify resource needs to advance this agenda and devise strategies for their development. (2). Support new research on reversibility/remediation through seed/pilot funding; (3). Bring new researchers into the field by offering opportunities for engagement in network activities, including (a) collaborations on pilot or other projects, (b) participation in network meetings/workshops as affiliated researchers, and (c) funded internships with network researchers; and (4). Pursue active out-reach through dissemination and engagement with the broader research community through: (a) a network website; (b) annual network workshops or symposia at various professional meetings that include disciplinary interests in life-course influences on early adversity, and (c) publishing one or more articles or a special issue on the potential for later-life reversibility/remediation for ELA, focued on potential bio-behavioral or other targets and promising intervention approaches. In accomplishing these aims, the proposed network will (a) contribute significantly to promoting needed theoretical and empirical work to clarify how major ELAs impact adult health and well-being, including addressing unanswered questions regarding the mediators and moderators of these influences at different life- stages and (b) support and promote the interdisciplinary collaborations needed to develop effective interventions for mid- and later life adults that can remediate/reverse and therefore to ameliorate effects of early life adversity."
"9575666","Urinary tract infections (UTI) are diseases of the kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra and are caused by microbes that live in the bowel. They afflict millions of people every year and are the second most common type of bacterial infection encountered by humans throughout their life span. Approximately 150 million UTI occur worldwide annually, accounting for $6 billion in healthcare costs. In the U.S.A., UTI are responsible for 8 million annual visits to healthcare providers. Some infections can lead to serious kidney complications and septicemia, with 13,000 deaths annually being attributed to nosocomial UTI. Although different microorganisms (e.g. bacteria, viruses, fungi) can cause these infections, Gram-negative bacteria are the most prevalent. The standard methods for species diagnosis are culture-based protocols that take up to 48 h. As a result, UTI are one of the most frequent reasons for antimicrobial prescriptions in healthcare facilities without a confirmed diagnosis. Therefore, modern rapid diagnostic methods that promote antimicrobial stewardship are crucial. Moreover, as patient outcomes are directly correlated to length of time to diagnosis and administration of appropriate therapy, the development of novel diagnostics that can rapidly identify (ID) the pathogen directly in clinical specimens, and simultaneously provide antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) is a critical factor for UTI management.  The goal of this project is to develop a product called multIDAST UTI that is superior to microbiological culture-based methods used for ID/AST of UTI. MultIDAST UTI will be developed as a qualitative in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test for rapid (<3 h) multiplexed identification of Gram-negative pathogens of uncomplicated UTI directly from urine and simultaneous characterization of their phenotypic responses to commonly prescribed antimicrobials. The product thereby bypasses the need for bacterial amplification and isolation and thus overcomes the major time-limiting step of current diagnostics. This will be achieved by uniquely combining species-specific phages, which have been engineered to produce a signature molecule upon bacterial infection, and isothermal helicase dependent amplification (HDA), which amplifies the signal ?108-fold. The ensuing phenotypic signal is directly correlated to cell fitness; thus, we can rapidly generate information related to the pathogens sensitivity or resistance to a particular drug by incubation in the absence or presence of antimicrobials. Signal responses will be measured using Solana, a fluorometer currently used in multiple FDA- cleared HDA diagnostic assays. The practical purpose of this contemporary system is to identify the pathogen and determine the antibiotic suitable to cure an infection, thereby promoting antimicrobial stewardship. It will support the fight against antibiotic resistance by addressing the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), classified by the Centers for Disease Control as one of the nation's 'urgent' antibiotic-resistant threats."
"9489287","Novel genomic mechanism for ligand-dependent transcription by androgen receptor Project Summary/Abstract Androgen receptor (AR) is a member of nuclear hormone receptor (NR) superfamily that binds to cognate hormone responsive elements (HREs) and regulates target gene expression in an endogenous ligand (agonist)-inducible manner in diverse tissues. As AR plays a key role in the onset and progression of prostate cancer, numerous synthetic AR antagonists have been developed to inhibit the action of endogenous AR ligands. A prominent example is enzalutamide (Xtandi®), a second-generation AR antagonist showing strong anti-cancer activity for prostate cancer. However, intrinsic or acquired resistance to enzalutamide, and all available AR antagonists, occurs leading to treatment failure. Thus, therapeutic efficacy of current AR antagonists needs to be improved. Elucidation of genomic mechanisms underlying antagonist-liganded AR function is critically important in order to improve AR-targeted therapy. In preliminary studies, we have defined the first high-resolution (motif-resolution) agonist- and antagonist-liganded AR cistromes in prostate cancer cells by using a novel chromatin immunoprecipitation-exonuclease (ChIP-exo) approach. Unexpectedly, we found that AR bound to natural agonist (dihydrotestosterone, DHT) and antagonist (enzalutamide) recognizes distinctly different DNA motifs on chromatin (termed ?DNA motif switching?). Surprisingly, integrated ChIP-exo and RNA-seq analysis found that enzalutamide-liganded AR, bound to a novel AR binding motif, significantly affects global, cancer-relevant transcription. By combining our novel ChIP-exo genomic approach with other epigenomic, proteomic and biochemical approaches, we further found that enzalutamide-liganded AR interacts with specific collaborating transcription factors (e.g. FoxA1) and non-DNA binding coregulators (e.g. Hsp90) on specific active cis-regulatory regions. Importantly, pharmacological Hsp90 inhibition significantly decreases expression of enzalutamide-liganded AR target genes (e.g. cancer promoting genes GR and CD55) and enhances cell growth inhibitory effect of enzalutamide. Based on these compelling data, we hypothesize that DNA motif switching is a novel genomic mechanism underlying antagonist-dependent, cancer-relevant transcription by antagonist-liganded AR transcription complex. Our specific aims are to: 1) determine whether specific transcription factors and epigenetic features globally facilitate AR DNA motif switching; and 2) investigate how antagonist-liganded AR binding regulates expression of cancer-relevant genes. By significantly enhancing our understanding of how antagonist-regulated transcription by AR is controlled at the genomic level, this study will lay the foundation for future development of improved AR-targeted therapy."
"9427912","Abstract Using a novel ex vivo stimulation method allowing measurement of brain responses to insulin, our research group established in 2012 a very common and profound abnormality in AD dementia cases closely associated with accelerated cognitive decline. That abnormality is brain insulin resistance, which can be induced by many early pathogenic factors in AD (including systemic insulin resistance) and can in turn cause or exacerbate many of its later pathologic features and cognitive deficits. Brain insulin resistance thus appears to be a nodal abnormality in AD, one whose alleviation may slow disease progression by exerting therapeutic effects on a broad spectrum of pathologies and thereby slow cognitive decline in AD. If so, it may be possible to treat AD by reducing brain insulin resistance. Among the most promising agents available for reducing brain insulin resistance are drugs in a relatively new class of antidiabetics known as incretin receptor agonists (IRAs), which are already known to reduce systemic insulin resistance. IRAs activate one or both of the 2 major incretin receptors: glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR). At least 3 IRAs cross the blood- brain barrier, namely two GLP-1R agonists (exendin-4 and liraglutide) and a recently developed dual GLP- 1R/GIPR agonist (i.e., a dual IRA). Administered outside the CNS, then, these IRAs could reduce both systemic and brain insulin resistance, in the latter case by activating GLP-1R and GIPR found in especially vulnerable areas of AD cases, including the neocortex and hippocampal formation. Our preliminary data show that IRAs applied ex vivo to the hippocampal formation from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cases markedly reduce insulin resistance in that brain structure and that the dual IRA has this effect even in advanced AD dementia (ADd) cases. Given these striking findings, we propose a preclinical evaluation of the hypothesis that AD can be treated by reducing brain insulin resistance with IRAs. Our approach is innovative in testing candidate AD therapeutics for their physiological effects on brain tissue from both an animal model of AD and from actual AD (and MCI) cases. Our candidate therapeutics (exendin-4, liraglutide, and a dual IRA) will be tested on 3 target brain areas in AD (lateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and hippocampal formation) from (a)  wild-type and APP/PS1 mice and (b) normal, MCI, and ADd cases. Aim 1 will determine the relative efficacy and pharmacokinetics of the 3 IRA candidates in reducing brain insulin resistance and their ability to reach the target brain areas via their normal subcutaneous route of administration. Aim 2 will test molecular mechanisms by which these drugs reduce brain insulin resistance. Aim 3 will test if IRA-induced reductions in brain insulin resistance are closely associated with reductions in a wide range of AD-related pathologies (e.g., elevated A?, increased phosphorylated tau, decreased cerebral glucose utilization) and spatial memory deficits."
"9475798","In any clinical research program, standardized patient care and patient data are the most fundamental and  valuable resources. The Clinical and Data Management Core (CDMC) is designed to be supportive of and  responsive to clinical research in a clinical environment that is increasingly dependent on electronic data.  Specifically, the CDMC will create an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-based Sickle Cell Registry (SCR) to  permit real time and efficient data entry at the point of contact with the patient. The CDMC recognizes and  will reconcile the differing and often conflicting requirements of EHR data entered for purely clinical purposes  with data entered for research. The EHR-based SCR will permit data to be entered once and jointly serve  clinicaland research needs. The CDMC will create best practice standards for clinical care and clinical  research using EHR-based tools for implementation and monitoring. The creation and enforcement of best  practice standards will reduce well-known and avoidable barriers to care affecting the outcomes of patients  with sickle cell disease. Standardization of best practices will be the cornerstone of a productive clinical  research program. The expertise in the CDCM, the EHR will be an integral part of a quality-driven clinical  research program in sickle cell disease. Lastly, the CDMC will aim to develop a clinical research program  that has sufficient patient numbers with detailed annotation of clinical data and biospecimens to permit future  involvement in multi-center cooperative group and industry-sponsored clinical research in sickle cell disease.  The tools and expertise of the CDMC is applied herein to sickle cell disease. However, the EHR-based  tools created and the expertise of the CDMC can be applied to any disease. The CDMC merges available  expertise in Health Informations with Bioinformatics to create a fully sustainable and broadly applicable core  resource. Systems to ensure EHR data accuracy, completeness and quality are a limiting factor in any  clinical research program. Sustainablility of the CDMC will be assured by the application of this technology  and expertise to other chronic and orphan diseases of childhood."
"9622508","Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance is a global health emergency. Despite this, the number of new antibiotics in development is limited and there is a desperate need for new pipelines to identify novel antibiotic candidates. We propose to develop a yeast-based drug-screening platform to be used in high-throughput compound screens to identify molecules with antimicrobial activity, targeting the highest priority pathogens. The overall strategy is to engineer the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae so its growth depends on the expression of sets of enzymes transplanted from human pathogens. By introducing entire enzymatic pathways, focusing on those that are essential in bacteria, fungus and plants but not in humans, the resulting yeast strains will provide an easy system for high-throughput drug screening and the opportunity to identify compounds with high therapeutic indices. Moreover, each enzymatic activity in the transplanted pathway will represent a unique druggable target, increasing the chances of compound identification. The goal of the Phase I study is to produce a series of engineered yeast strains expressing a pathway with multiple unique enzymatic activities, focusing mainly on priority pathogens as identified by the NIAID and the World Health Organization. Once developed, these strains can be used in high throughput drug screening studies. !"
"9615641","Malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of human cancers. Its ability to metastasize in combination with its notorious resistance to conventional chemotherapeutical agents makes melanoma extremely difficult to cure. Consequently, the median survival of patients with metastatic melanoma is only 8.5 months. The acquisition of invasion capability, which occurs already in primary melanomas, is a prerequisite for metastasis and is considered a critical event associated with poor prognosis.  We have recently demonstrated that expression of guanosine monophosphate reductase (GMPR), an enzyme involved in the de novo biosynthesis of purine nucleotides, was downregulated at the invasive stages of human melanoma. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments revealed that GMPR suppresses the ability of melanoma cells to form invadopodia, degrade extracellular matrix, invade (in vitro and in vivo), and grow as tumor xenografts. We further demonstrated that depletion of guanosine monophosphate synthase (GMPS), a functional antagonist of GMPR, decreases active (GTP-bound) RAC1, RHOA and RHOC. We hypothesized that GMPS, GMPR, and perhaps other guanylate biosynthesis enzymes, regulate the activity of the above RHO-GTPases via modulation of GTP levels in the vicinity of these RHO-GTPases. This hypothesis will be tested in Specific Aim 1.  We demonstrated that the activity of GMPR can be regulated by phosphorylation. Unbiased in vitro kinase screening identified several kinases as potential candidates for GMPR phosphorylation. Modulation of GTP levels has never been considered as a mechanism of regulation of invasion by any kinase. Therefore, in Specific Aim 2, using functional approaches, we will test candidates' ability to regulate GTP levels, RHO- GTPase activity and cell invasion in a GMPR-dependent manner.  Currently, no efficient chemotherapy exists for melanoma patients with wildtype BRAF and mutant NRAS. Survival of patients with mutant BRAF was improved by the introduction of its inhibitor vemurafenib (VEM), however rapidly developing resistance circumvents VEM efficacy. Although the mechanisms of such resistance vary, several melanoma cell lines independently selected for VEM resistance possessed increased invasion ability. We demonstrated that several GTP-depleting agents can significantly affect melanoma xenograft growth in immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice. Therefore, in Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the efficacy of one of such agents alone or in combination with existing anti-melanoma therapy in several preclinical melanoma models."
"9458139","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of PDAC is an area of highest priority and an unmet need for advancing public health in the United States. Certain sub-groups of patients, such as those with mucinous pancreatic cysts are at higher risk for progression to PDAC, but even in these cohorts, there is potential for over-diagnosis, underscoring the need for biomarkers that can accurately distinguish aggressive versus indolent cysts. The long term goal of our EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC), comprised of MD Anderson (MDACC), University of Utah and Indiana University, is to implement a multi-institutional framework for collecting the highest quality biospecimens from patients with a variety of well-defined pancreatic pathologies in order to conduct biomarker validation studies for early detection of PDAC that conform to EDRN-defined Phase 2 and Phase 3 study design. Specifically, this CVC will prospectively recruit at least 600 patients with early stage (resected) PDAC, at least 300 patients with surgically resected pancreatic cystic lesions of varying histology and grades of dysplasia, at least 400 benign pancreatic diseases (including chronic pancreatitis, benign cysts, endocrine tumors of low malignant potential), at least 300 patients with non-resected pancreatic cystic lesions that have follow up of 2 years or greater without evidence for progression, and at least 300 control patients with non- pancreatic diseases, in order to obtain plasma and serum samples from these subjects for biomarker validation studies. Additionally, we will obtain cyst fluid samples from all patients with pancreatic cystic lesions, both surgically resected and those being followed by endoscopic imaging. In accordance with the EDRN principles, these biospecimens will be utilized in facilitating collaborations with other BDLs, for biomarker discovery and validation studies. Preliminary data generated in our CVC has identified a focused panel of overexpressed autoantibodies and antigens (ERBB2, TNC, ESR1, CACNA1D and CDKN2AIP) that significantly improves CA19-9 AUC in both diagnostic and pre-diagnostic cohorts. We will use a hybrid array platform developed at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) that is capable of quantifying both antigens and autoantibodies from plasma, and use this platform to complete three PRoBE compliant biomarker studies: Study 1 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 3 study in pre-diagnostic PDAC samples (n=158) and matched controls (n=158) from WHI and PLCO cohorts, followed by an EDRN-defined Phase 2 case control study of early stage (resectable) PDAC (N = 300) versus chronic pancreatitis (N = 300) and non-pancreatic disease controls (N=300); Study 2 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 3 study in PLCO pre-diagnostic PDAC samples (n=160), and matched controls (n=160); and Study 3 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 2 case control study of pancreatic cystic neoplasms with high-grade dysplasia or cancer (N =150) versus pancreatic cystic neoplasms with surgically confirmed low-grade dysplasia and non-mucinous cystic lesions (N=150), as well as low-risk cyst with adequate follow up that are followed without surgery (N=150)."

"9462000","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NIA Interventions Testing Program is a multi-site translational research program to evaluate agents hypothesized to extend mouse lifespan; this part of the program is not under review, and will be expanded 2 fold at each site, as mandated by the RFA. Each site has special skills - mouse expertise and measures of age-sensitive traits at The Jackson Laboratory (Jackson), pathology and statistical analysis at the University of Michigan (UM), and pharmacology/toxicology at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT) - which will be expanded as mandated by the RFA. Jackson currently supplies diets (control and with interventions added) and performs pilot mouse studies; these jobs will expand. Also, Jackson will routinely supply old, middle-aged and young untreated controls to collaborators, and some positive controls treated with established, effective interventions. In mandated healthspan studies, Jackson will specialize in non-invasive assays to measure changes with age in a variety of physiological systems without harm to the mouse. Treated and control mice will be longitudinally tested at 16 and 22 months of age to follow individual changes with age before disease sets in; most interventions start by 4-10 months, so effects may be detectable by 16 months. Longitudinal testing compared to cross-sectional, permits a more powerful quantification of treatment effects during aging in the genetically heterogeneous UM-HET3 population because genetic variance can be statistically removed. In addition, the relative influence of individual differences in response to the treatment during aging can be quantified. Current plans are to test: body weight; circulating hemoglobin; circulating white blood cell populations, including naïve CD4 T cells; short-term memory (5-minute T maze); activity and anxiety (10-minute open field test); grip strength; kidney function (urinary albumin/creatinine ratio); cataracts; collagen aging (tail tendon collagen denaturation); and wound healing (using the incision to remove tail tendon). All tests are designed to minimize stress and optimize quantitative definition of health. Many of these tests have already been shown to change with age in UM-HET3 mice; age-sensitivity will be confirmed for all tests in pilot studies before use with interventions. Benefits of interventions indicated by any of these tests will guide more extensive physiological and biochemical studies, both in the ITP laboratories and elsewhere. Two interventions already shown to extend lifespan in UM-HET3 mice - diet restriction and rapamycin - will be used as positive controls when appropriate."

"9486001","Emphysematous chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an irreversible lung disease of increasing prevalence for which effective disease modifying therapy is not available. Patients with COPD exhibit dysregulated and exaggerated inflammatory and immunologic responses. Recent studies have shown that the aminopeptidase activity of the leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) enzyme may play crucial roles in the process of resolving inflammation. We have independently demonstrated effective protection of murine lungs against COPD by selectively augmenting the LTA4H aminopeptidase activity with 4MDM, a selective small molecule activator of the LTA4H aminopeptidase activity. When COPD was induced with cigarette smoke, treatment with 4MDM significantly reduced severity of COPD as determined by pre-mortem physiologic and post-mortem anatomic assessment. On the basis of these findings, we believe that 4MDM can serve as a lead molecule for the discovery of novel anti-inflammatory agents to treat COPD. Therefore, we propose specific aims to better understand the target LTA4H enzyme structure, discover new activators of the LTA4H aminopeptidase activity, and determine the effect of these compounds in the pathogenesis of COPD. We believe that our proposed work and expected outcomes will provide potential first-in-class drugs to treat patients with COPD."
"9463493","Project Summary Extensive research has established that kappa opioid receptor (KOR) antagonists can block the dysphoria, anxiety and cognitive disruptions caused by behavioral stress exposure and that KOR agonists produce strong anxiogenic, aversive and psychotomimetic effects in humans and animal models of human behaviors. Our current understanding is that the dynorphin-KOR system produces its depressive effects on mood and cognition through actions on the serotonergic (5HT) projections from Dorsal Raphe Nucleus (DRN) to the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) and Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA). In addition, published results show that the dynorphin-KOR system regulates the dopaminergic (DA) inputs from the VTA to NAc. The studies proposed in Project 1 would use a combination of optogenetic and mouse genetic approaches to test the hypothesis that endogenous dynorphins, locally released within the DRN-VTA-NAc circuit during stress-exposure, produce aversion behaviors and disrupt cognition."
"9556024","ABSTRACT A primary challenge in pancreatic cancer is preventing tumor recurrence in patients following a ?curative intent? resection procedure (5-year survival rate 21%). It is believed that, in a subset of patients, the primary cause of tumor recurrence is small sub-cm and sub-mm disease that is unseen and, therefore, un-resected at the time of surgery. To address this problem, researchers are developing new Fluorescently-Guided Cytoreductive Surgery (FGCS) techniques with the goal of enabling surgeons to intraoperatively detect and resect sub-cm and sub-mm tumors. These techniques administer a fluorescent probe?such as a fluorescently-conjugated antibody, small molecule, peptide, quantum dot or nanoparticle?that localizes to tumors thereby facilitating identification of tumor tissue. Localization to the tumor is generally achieved via one of two broadly classified targeting strategies: ?Passive Targeting? via the enhanced-permeability and retention (EPR) effect; or, ?Active Targeting? through the incorporation of a targeting moiety or antibody into the probe. However, none of these technologies is able to identify sub-cm and sub-mm disease. This proposal develops a novel, patented, fluorescent probe, the ?highly- fluorescent rhodamine-labeled expansile nanoparticle? (HFR-eNP), that targets tumors via a unique Materials- Based Targeting strategy. This mechanism leverages both the material functionality of the nanoparticle polymer (e.g., swelling) and fundamental pathophysiological properties of tumors (e.g., increased metabolic rate) to achieve tumor-specific localization with >95% accuracy. We hypothesize that by using HFR-eNPs to guide cytoreductive surgery of disseminated sub-cm and sub-mm tumors, we will significantly improve overall survival compared to unguided resections. Preliminary data demonstrate: 1) HFR-eNPs possess 5- to 10-fold increased fluorescence compared to equivalent concentrations of free rhodamine and can be sterilized with gamma irradiation without significant loss of this fluorescence; 2) large-scale production of HFR-eNPs on a clinical (i.e., 1 liter batch) scale; 3) non-toxicity of the HFR-eNPs in vitro and in vivo; 4) sensitive and specific localization to sub-cm and sub-mm pancreatic tumors in vivo; and, 5) proof-of-concept HFR-eNP-guided cytoreductive surgery to remove large (>1 cm), sub-cm and sub-mm tumors in vivo. Two key Go/No-Go decisions regarding the com- mercialization of this technology are addressed in this proposal. First, in order to be used clinically, a sterilization protocol must be developed that does not alter the HFR-eNP polymer or quench the rhodamine fluorescence. And, following sterilization, the in vivo functionality/tumor localization of the particles must be confirmed. Second, the benefit afforded by using HFR-eNPs to guide the resection of pancreatic tumors, in particular sub-cm and sub-mm tumors, must be quantified through an in vivo cytoreductive surgery model. Thus, the aims of this proposal are: Aim 1) Sterilize HFR-eNPs via Gamma irradiation and confirm tumor localization post-sterilization; Aim 2) Determine the improvement to survival afforded by HFR-eNP-guided surgical resections."
"9444550","Obesity increases the risk for stroke. Patients with obesity have worse outcome after stroke. It is conceivable that obesity-induced cerebral vascular remodeling contributes to these effects. Our preliminary results showed that the high fat diet (HFD)-fed wild-type mice are obese, hyperglycemic and hyperlipidemia, conditions that are similar to human. These mice have an increased tortuosity and vascular density and reduced internal diameters in their cerebral arteries. They also have decreased brain ischemic tolerance and increased blood-brain barrier permeability after stroke. The activity of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP- 9), a collagenase and gelatinase, was increased in the brain tissues of HFD-fed mice. HFD did not induce cerebral vascular remodeling and worsen neurological outcome after focal brain ischemia in MMP-9 knockout mice. Also, it has been reported in the literature that obesity induces inflammation and oxidative stress that can activate MMP-9. Thus, we hypothesize that obesity induces MMP-9-dependent cerebral vascular remodeling to reduce cerebral vascular reserve to lead to reduced ischemic tolerance and that obesity may involve neuroinflammation and oxidative stress to activate MMP-9. In this project, we will test this hypothesis by using HFD-fed mice. A state-of-the-art technique called photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) will be used to monitor the dynamic changes of blood flow and oxygen supply in the ischemic penumbral brain region and cerebral vascular reserve under in vivo condition when mice are awake. A classical focal brain ischemia model will be used. Various pharmacological, genetic and molecular biological approaches will be used to determine how cerebral vascular reserve is affected and MMP-9 is activated in the brain. These studies may not only improve our understanding of obesity-induced cerebral vascular remodeling and poor ischemic tolerance but also identify potential targets for achieving better neurological outcome after brain ischemia in patients with obesity."
"9649006","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glutamine is an essential nutrient to support the survival and proliferation of cancer cells, and increased use of glutamine to fuel anabolic processes has been observed in a wide variety of tumors. However, as tumors grow, increased glutamine catabolism often depletes the local supply, leading tumor cells to face periods of glutamine deprivation. How tumor cells sense glutamine levels and survive these temporary periods of glutamine deprivation is unclear, but such survival is necessary for tumors to persist. Our goal is to define the molecular pathways that regulate cell survival under low glutamine conditions and evaluate the potential of simultaneously blocking both glutamine metabolism and the adaptive survival response as a novel therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. We have recently shown that glutamine deprivation leads to induction of the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit B55?, thereby triggering the formation of an active PP2A complex consisting of catalytic C and scaffolding A subunits and the specifically-induced B55? subunit. This B55?- containing PP2A complex is required for tumor cell survival upon glutamine depletion. We further found that induction of B55? activates p53, an important sensor of metabolic stress. Our preliminary data suggest that B55? activates p53 through a mechanism that involves dephosphorylation of EDD, a previously unidentified substrate of B55? that is a known negative regulator of p53. In addition, we have preliminary data indicating that IKKß, the master regulator of NF-kB transcription factors, is phosphorylated upon glutamine deprivation and required for B55? induction. We therefore hypothesize that B55? is induced by the IKKß pathway to dephosphorylate EDD, thereby leading to p53 activation and cancer cell survival under low glutamine conditions. Thus, targeting both glutamine metabolism and the IKKß B55?-EDD-p53 survival pathway could be an effective therapeutic approach to kill tumor cells. To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims: 1) Determine the role of IKKß in B55?-mediated activation of p53 and cell survival upon glutamine deprivation; 2) Examine if B55? activates p53 upon glutamine deprivation by dephosphorylating EDD; 3) Determine the combined effect of IKKß and glutamine metabolism inhibition on growth of tumors with different p53 status. The results of the proposed studies will define the molecular mechanisms and functional impact of the IKKß B55?-p53 pathway in the metabolic adaptive response to glutamine deprivation. A wide variety of human cancer cell lines are sensitive to glutamine starvation, and reagents that impair cells' ability to use glutamine are currently being studied as novel cancer therapies. The proposed studies will provide deeper understanding of the survival pathway used by cancer cells when glutamine metabolism is blocked, and thus will reveal novel therapeutic directions for targeting both glutamine metabolism and the survival pathway in order to efficiently kill tumor cells."
"9518080","Project summary/Abstract  Osteomyelitis (OM) is a microbial-induced inflammatory bone disease that disrupts normal skeletal remodeling. Staphylococcus aureus is the principle etiologic agent, accounting for roughly 90% of all hematogenous cases in children. The treatment of OM frequently involves the use of intravenous antibiotics, but even with appropriate antimicrobial therapy, a subset of patients with OM will require surgical debridement. A majority of the research on OM to date has centered on adult OM, in particular related to orthopedic implants. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need based on gaps in our understanding of the pathogenesis of OM in the pediatric population. Herein, we propose to optimize mouse models of S. aureus-induced OM to reflect the pathophysiology of pediatric disease, paving the way for studies to elucidate underlying disease mechanisms and novel treatment approaches. This R21 falls into the category of model development ? currently there is no model for pediatric OM. Thus, the reward will be a new platform for the investigation of this understudied condition. Unlike in adults, OM in children typically occurs due to hematogenous spread of bacteria, but no current model features blood-born infection in growing animals. In this proposal, we will use a combination of intratibial and intravenous injection, following disease progression longitudinally with bioluminescence and in vivo microCT imaging. We will also perform dose responses, to find the lowest disease-causing inocula, which we expect will reflect about host-pathogen interactions better than high doses. The incidence of OM caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections has increased, now reaching similar levels as methicillin sensitive (MSSA) strains. Effective antibiotics for MRSA strains are still available, but treatment periods are long and complications can be severe. There has been little research to understand if the higher morbidity of MRSA vs MSSA OM extends beyond antibiotic sensitivity to other aspects of disease initiation or progression. We will enable such work by establishing comparable models of OM with MRSA and MSSA strains from pediatric OM patients (ie. clinical isolates), in rapidly growing 6 week old mice. Bone infection in children is generally localized near the growth plate of long bones, a very active area for bone formation. We will investigate the hypothesis that the high bone anabolism found during growth in childhood contributes to development or progression of hematogenous OM. We will also determine whether the presence of a reparative state following mild bone injury in growing animals affects the course of hematogenous OM initiated shortly after the injury. Future projects will then focus on the cellular basis for these host effects on a range of bacterial strains, yielding insight into the pathogenesis of pediatric OM. Thus, our aims are as follows: Aim 1: Optimize and characterize direct tibial inoculation models of MSSA and MRSA- induced OM in growing mice. Aim 2: Develop models of hematogenous MSSA and MRSA OM in growing mice. Aim 3: Determine role of bone anabolism and repair in localization of hematogenous OM lesions."
"9604876","Abstract We are developing a novel embedded-ensemble encoding (EEE) theory for mammalian neocortex to unify data from cell and network experiments, and to infer general principles of how information is processed in the brain. Our combination of investigators includes a theorist/modeler, an experimentalist/modeler and a modeler/ neuroinformatician. Our theory is based on the observation that cortical pyramidal neurons produce synaptically-induced dendritic plateau potentials that place an individual neuron into an activated state. This brings that neuron near to threshold, and also reduces membrane time constant, so that the activated cell PNact can readily and rapidly follow synaptic inputs. We hypothesize that ensembles of these activated cells provide the activated ensemble Eact, embedded in the overall cells of the column. There is then a second embedding of an ensemble based on synchronized spiking among the cells of Eact. This twice-embedded ensemble is denoted as Esync, with Esync Eact. Synchronized spike coding within area then provides the substrate for a broad distributed ensemble across areas that would allow the binding of multimodal features into coherent object perception (based on binding-by-synchrony theory). EEE theory has direct implications for interpretation of both binding-by-synchrony theory, and for theories of Bayesian predictive coding. Developed tools will be used to facilitate other projects through our end-users: 1. developing further reduced models for more detailed analysis (Mihalas); 2. develop models for place cell theory (Kubie); 3. develop new data analysis and stimulation protocols in macaque for use in brain-machine interface development (Francis). We propose to work primarily in a multiscale model both to develop further details of EEE theory, and to make speci?c predictions. In neuroscience, unlike in physics, detailed predictions for measures in the brain must be obtained by instantiating the theory in simulation, which allows the experimentalist to identify a particular scale and aspect of the theory that is accessible through their experimental measures. Our Speci?c Aims are: 1. Develop a set of single cell models of Layer 5 pyramidal cells based on available experimental data and morphologies, and test input/output activity patterns for inputs on basilar and apical oblique dendrites. Generate model predictions that can be tested in in vitro or in vivo experiments with dendritic imaging. 2. Build networks and test with ?ring variability, coding density, information-theoretic signal ?ow-through, graph-theoretic measures. Veri?cation will be performed across multiple model instantiations. Speci?c experimental predictions will be made for future model validation. 3. Disseminate theory, models and experimental predictions through model sharing, workshops, tutorials, and courses. Tools to be developed and shared include genetic algorithms for model parameter ?tting, background-driving and activation-input data-suites, and speci?c cell and network models."
"9472226","BIOINFORMATICS CORE SUMMARY  The Bioinformatics Core serves as a centralized resource for providing expert and timely bioinformatics consulting, analysis, collaborative research, management, and training solutions for a broad range of biomedical data including high-throughput data. The Bioinformatics Core will support the specific aims of the INBRE IV: Hawaii Statewide Research & Education Partnership (HiSREP) by providing a strong and integrated bioinformatics service in research, education, investigation and creation of innovative methodologies.  During INBRE III, the Bioinformatics Core was reorganized to better serve as a resource to the HiSREP community, and consequently made substantial progress. We observed an annual increase in the number of users (nearly 5-fold) utilizing the Bioinformatics Core services from almost all the HiSREP institutions. The Bioinformatics Core has successfully provided bioinformatics/biostatistics training and education opportunities to the HiSREP community. During INBRE III, the Bioinformatics infrastructure was also significantly enhanced. Specifically, an Illumina NextSeq 500 machine was recently purchased and will function to greatly accelerate the next generation sequencing-based research in the HiSREP network. In addition, a Cray CS300 Supercomputer was installed at UH ITS Center, to which the Bioinformatics Core has full access.  In INBRE IV, the Bioinformatics Core will continue to function as an important component of the network. Specifically, the Core will contribute to INBRE IV objectives in three key ways: (i) Customized Services: the core will facilitate the acquisition of preliminary data for grant applications and subsequent research by HiSREP investigators via consultation on experimental design and data management as well as offer expertise in data analysis and interpretation in bioinformatics and biostatistics; (ii) Education and Training: the Bioinformatics Core will provide education in bioinformatics and biostatistics, as well as support for the career development of researchers (both students and faculty), and; (iii) Core Development: the Bioinformatics Core will create new tools and methods or repurpose existing tools and strategies to accelerate advances in the science. In all of these activities, the Core will work collaboratively with other local and national bioinformatics cores. To reach these goals, we propose four Specific Aims: (1) Expand Bioinformatics Core services to support biomedical research needs of HiSREP investigators in the performance of their research. (2) Provide education and training opportunities in bioinformatics-related topics to all stage HiSREP research students and scientists as well as community partners. (3) Develop novel bioinformatics tools to enhance bioinformatics research through the interactions of the combined and expanded expertise of the Bioinformatics Core. (4) Build institutional and community research synergy through the interaction and collaboration with the HiSREP partners."
"9565954","Abstract  Irritability is the most common reason that children are referred for mental health services9. However, irritability- specific treatments are lacking, in part because little is known about its pathophysiology. It is also a heritable trait1,2 that, even at relatively low levels3,4, increases risk for many common psychiatric disorders. An emerging literature suggests that impairments in cognitive flexibility may be a core mechanism underlying irritability13,14. However, the precise mechanisms that mediate the cognitive rigidity in irritable youth have yet to be identified. In addition, little is known about the mechanisms by which irritability leads to disparate forms of psychopathology. While deficits in cognitive flexibility may be a shared mechanism underlying many forms of irritability, impairments in other domains of executive functioning may influence the development and clinical expression of irritability, leading some youth to develop internalizing, and others externalizing, psychopathology21. The goal of this research proposal is to elucidate the neurocognitive mechanisms mediating irritability, and identify moderators that shape the way in which irritability is expressed clinically over the course of child and early adolescent development. This knowledge is crucial to developing intervention/prevention efforts that jointly target both common and specific liabilities and mechanisms of psychopathology. The proposed study has three specific aims: (1) Developmentally adapt and psychometrically validate a novel Wisconsin Card Sorting Task for use in conjunction with temporally sensitive event-related potentials (ERPs) to isolate and disentangle the role of set-switching, working memory and feedback processing in cognitive flexibility; (2) Relate neural indices of set-switching, working memory and reinforcement learning to irritability in 7-10 year old children (N = 95); and (3) Capitalizing on a large ongoing NIMH-funded longitudinal study (N=609) of 12 year-old children, use cross-lagged path modeling to examine whether the error-related negativity (ERN) at ages 6 and 9 moderates heterotypic continuity of irritability to internalizing and externalizing symptoms from ages 3 to 12. The current training proposal will allow me to integrate training from co-sponsors and consultants who have expertise in running large-scale studies on youth irritability (Drs. Klein and Leibenluft), task development for pediatric populations (Drs. Hajcak and Leibenluft) advanced statistical techniques to conduct longitudinal data analysis (Dr. Kotov), and developmental neuroscience (Dr. Tottenham)."
"9477035","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because an amino acid can be encoded by as many as six codons, there are many different ways to encode any particular protein. Biases exist in the way codons are used. A little-studied bias is the codon pair bias, such that some codons prefer to be adjacent to certain other codons. This codon pair bias is completely separate and independent from codon usage. Recently, we have found that when viruses are re-coded to have a bad codon pair bias, the viruses are attenuated, in extreme cases to inviability. It appears that attenuation of a virus via a bad codon pair bias can be used to make a live, attenuated vaccine. However, while the procedure works, nothing whatever is known about the mechanism by which codon pair bias causes attenuation. In this proposal, we will investigate the mechanisms of attenuation by bad codon pair bias. This will be done in yeast, where we have recently shown there are strong codon pair bias effects. We have found two major classes of attenuating codon pairs, and each class may work by a distinct mechanism. Recent results suggest that the attenuating codon pairs are interfering with proper translation, which is triggering translation quality control pathways such as nonsense mediated decay to destroy the recoded mRNAs. Here, we will learn the mechanisms of attenuation by codon pair bias. The significance of this is twofold: from a basic research point-of-view, this research may reveal completely new aspects of RNA processing and translational quality control explaining how a change in the ordering of synonymous codons can drastically affect gene expression; from a medical point-of-view, this research will help us design and synthesize better attenuated viruses for potential use in vaccines. Relevance One way to make an anti-viral vaccine is to mutate the virus to weaken it, and then use this weakened virus as a vaccine (e.g., FluMist, a live Flu vaccine). However there are many difficulties. Recently we have found a new method, codon pair de-optimization, for making live attenuated viral vaccines. Although the method works (for polio, flu, dengue, respiratory syncytial virus), we do not know why it works. Here, we will study the mechanism of attenuation by codon pair de-optimization."
"9461494","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are addressing two critical areas identified by the FDA: the impact of cigarette packaging and labeling on consumer perceptions and on smoking behavior; and the effectiveness of graphic warning labels on communicating risk of tobacco products. Our aim is to provide some of the substantial evidence that Judge Jones required in finding against the FDA packaging regulations. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), after successful completion of a run-in period, we will enroll committed smokers who smoke one of the five most popular brands and who have no intention of quitting in the next 6-months. All participants will purchase their cigarettes at a discount from the study team. The study will manufacture cigarette packs and repackage cigarettes from the smoker's usual brand. The three study arms will be: a) a plain pack with all marketing materials removed (PP); b) PP with an added graphic warning image (Australian model-AM); or c) a standard pack with all marketing materials unaltered (ST). The study includes a three month purchasing intervention and continued follow-up through 12 months. Our primary Aim is to test whether removing all tobacco industry imagery from the standard US pack changes consumer perceptions of their cigarettes. Aim 2 will test whether adding large graphic warning labels to the plain packs increases the perception of harm and potential risk of tobacco products. Aim 3 will test whether the Australian model packs result in a change in the handling of cigarette packs, consumption patterns and quitting cognitions. We use daily text messaging during the purchasing period to identify motivation to continue purchasing and we have included a tiered incentive program to minimize attrition. During the run-in phase, we will conduct a conjoint marketing study to assess cognitions and utilities of the different pack elements and we will use these in our analyses. Throughout the study interactive text messaging assessments will be used to remove recall bias and measure acute and persistent impact of labeling and marketing on perceptions of tobacco products, subjective effects of consumption, awareness of tobacco- related harms, tobacco use behavior, and quitting motivation. At three separate time points, participants will: a) complete a web-based questionnaire, b) provide a saliva sample for cotinine analysis and c) undertake a lab- based multi-modal motion sensor technology assessment to classify handling of different packs and time interacting with warning labels. The rigorous design and extensive objective measurements are significant innovations on the currently published research in this field and should lead to significant advances in tobacco regulatory science. These will allow us to address the study aims and hypotheses with more sophisticated statistical analyses that include changes over time using generalized linear mixed effect models"
"9458194","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Eukaryotic organisms, including animals and plants, have evolved sophisticated immune systems to protect themselves against pathogens. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are short, non-coding regulatory RNAs that induce RNA interference (RNAi) by binding to Argonaute (AGO) proteins and directing silencing of genes with complementary sequences. Our work and those of others have demonstrated that sRNAs, derived from either hosts or pathogens, function through AGO proteins and play an important role in host-pathogen interactions. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Our long-term goal is to understand the dynamic regulation of sRNAs and RNAi in host innate immunity. AGO proteins are key players of sRNA- mediated gene silencing, and we hypothesize that they are modified and regulated by their associated proteins to modulate sRNA-mediated gene silencing. Here, we seek to understand the modification and regulation of AGOs in RNAi pathway, and in host antibacterial and antifungal immune responses, by using model plant-pathogen interaction systems - Arabidopsis thaliana and its bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and aggressive fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. During the last funding period, we have identified diverse classes of host sRNAs regulating host immunity, and have demonstrated that Arabidopsis AGO2 (AtAGO2) is highly induced by bacterial infection and positively regulates host immunity. We have also shown that B. cinerea delivers its sRNAs into host cells and hijacks host AtAGO1 to suppress host immunity genes for successful infection. To obtain a mechanistic understanding of how AtAGO1 and AtAGO2 are regulated, we have identified their associated proteins via proteomics analysis. This renewal will study the modification and regulation of AtAGO1 and AtAGO2 by their associated proteins in RNAi pathways and host innate immunity. The output of this study will significantly advance our understanding of dynamic control of RNAi in host immune responses against pathogens, which will have great impact on both agricultural and human health. The specific aims are: 1. Elucidate the role of protein arginine methyltransferases in modification and regulation of AtAGO function in host immunity. 2. Investigate the function of DDX3-like RNA helicases in modulating AtAGO function in host immunity. 3. Study the role of protein phosphatases in modulating AtAGO and host immunity."
"9475087","Project Summary/Abstract Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is characterized by a targeted autoimmune attack against self-antigens present on or within the insulin-producing ? cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, resulting in their destruction and subsequent loss of systemic blood glucose homeostasis. Current treatment options include lifelong disease management via frequent blood glucose monitoring and injections with exogenous insulin, but to date, there is no cure or means to prevent the disease in humans. Significant progress has been made improving patients' ability to manage their T1D symptoms (i.e., various forms of insulin, continuous glucose monitoring, and more), but even with rigorous glycemic monitoring, micro- and macro-vascular disease are common and life expectancy reduced. This, combined with high cost of T1D care, supports a pressing need for a safe and effective therapy. Systemic immunosuppression can offer a temporary reprieve from autoimmunity and T1D, but these treatments, associated with toxic side effects, are not antigen specific and thus, do not address the underlying cause of the disease. Previous studies have shown that combining a short course immunosuppressant, anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), with daily oral administration of genetically modified Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) expressing a key T1D autoantigen (proinsulin) and a tolerogenic cytokine (IL-10) (L. lactis PINS-IL-10) prevents and reverses T1D in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice by inducing lasting antigen-specific immunological tolerance. L. lactis PINS-IL-10 is non-pathogenic, non-colonizing, and lacks the ability to produce the essential amino acid thymidine which serves as a containment system to prevent dissemination into the environment. This innovative L. lactis technology is generally regarded as safe (GRAS) by the FDA and approved for use in humans for the treatment of Crohn?s disease. However, anti-CD3 mAb is not FDA approved for human clinical use. Herein, we propose oral treatment of NOD mice with L. lactis PINS-IL-10 combined with an alternative immunosuppressive agent, anti- thymocyte globulin (ATG), which has been approved for use in humans for decades. We expect that ATG + L. lactis PINS-IL-10 combination therapy will significantly prevent or delay T1D onset in NOD mice. In addition to studies of treatment efficacy, detailed investigations of therapeutic mechanism will be performed including cross-sectional analysis of regulatory T cells, helper T cells, dendritic cells, and innate lymphoid cells by flow cytometry of the gut associated lymphoid tissues (GALT), the target organ (pancreas), and pancreatic draining lymph nodes; functional assays measuring T cell autoantigen recall and regulatory T cell (Treg) suppression; and in vivo adoptive transfer of T1D. Phenotypic or functional changes in the immune cell subsets responsible for oral tolerance induction by the proposed therapy might offer important utility as biomarkers for monitoring therapeutic response in future studies. If effective, this combinatorial treatment can quickly be translated for human use and by modifying the autoantigen secreted by L. lactis, offers potential application in additional autoimmune diseases beyond T1D. Thus, we expect that ATG + L. lactis PINS-IL-10 combination therapy may present a much-needed low-risk intervention to prevent or even cure T1D."

"9575336","Abstract  Viral infection results in thousands of deaths and an enormous humanitarian burden every year, yet unlike antibiotics for bacterial infection, very few antivirals are available. At present, few methods exist for generating effective antivirals. The increasing availability of atomic resolution structural information of various viral surface proteins promises to chance this. The overall objective of this application is to use the surface glycoproteins of Paramyxoviruses (PMV) as a model system to generate design methodologies that will take advantage of structural features present in a broad range of viruses, resulting in a robust platform for the design of new therapeutics, diagnostics and immunogens for vaccination. PMVs are an ideal model system as their family members have the same fold for receptor recognition yet bind to very different host cell receptors.  We recently demonstrated that computational protein design can be used to generate de novo antivirals that broadly neutralize diverse strains of influenza. These computer-generated proteins can also function as highly sensitive diagnostics. Guided by these results, the following specific aims will be pursued: (i) Develop general design strategies to target virus:host cell receptor interactions and design antivirals using Hendra and Nipah Viruses as model systems; (ii) inhibit membrane fusion of RSV by targeting the intermediate fusion states; and (iii) selectively stabilize the pre- and post-fusion state stabilization of the F- protein of RSV and probe their contributions to infectivity and vaccine design.  The first aim is based on the observation that many receptor-binding sites of enveloped viruses lay within a recessed pocket, enabling evasion from the immune system. Computational design strategies which specifically target pockets will enable the development a robust algorithm to generate antiviral proteins which bind at these sites. The second aim is based on the hypothesis that the post-fusion structure of viral surface proteins provides the blueprint to targeting their transition state. Small proteins will be designed to molecularly ?jam? the 3-helical core structure that is common to most type I fusion proteins and therefore will be provide a general method to inhibit type I fusion proteins, which include viruses such as HIV-1, Ebola, SARS and others. Lastly, the objective of aim three is to simultaneously model the pre- and post-fusion states of the F-protein of RSV to generate variants to favor one state over the other. Variants will be assayed for changes in infectivity. The trapped pre-fusion state stabilized by disfavoring the post-fusion state will provide the basis for a new angle on immunogen design. If successful, data on designs will be fed back into the developed algorithm, leading to rapid development of new antivirals against emerging epidemics."

"9483584","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein aggregation is a feature of most neurodegenerative diseases, including the transthyretin (TTR) amyloidoses. TTR is a tetrameric protein secreted into the blood by the liver. Compelling evidence suggests that peripheral neurodegeneration in the TTR amyloidoses results from rate- limiting TTR tetramer dissociation, aberrant monomer misfolding and misfolded TTR assembly into a spectrum of TTR aggregate structures. Extracellular aggregation leads to proteotoxicity in tissues not synthesizing TTR by a cell non-autonomous process that we seek to understand via the proposed experiments, and which is not understood for any aggregation-associated neurodegenerative disease. In humans, WT TTR aggregation leads to a cardiomyopathy, whereas aggregation of other TTR mutations leads to a primary neuropathy. Herein, we report the development and partial characterization of transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans models of the TTR amyloidoses, exhibiting TTR aggregation and three cell non-autonomous quantifiable neuronal TTR proteotoxicity-associated cellular and sub-cellular phenotypes with direct relevance to human disease. We will characterize TTR mRNA levels and TTR conformations including tetramers, and misfolded TTR oligomers in these models as a function of aging and correlate these with the neuronal phenotypes observed. Defects in microtubule-based trafficking appear to be a centrally important mechanistic feature of TTR proteotoxicity. The availability of novel small molecule and genetic tools to quantify TTR conformation, as well as the ability to image sub-cellular phenotypes in a single neuron as a function of aging in the same living worm to quantify phenotypic changes affords us an extraordinary opportunity to understand the cell biology and biochemistry of neurodegeneration. Access to the drug tafamidis, which dramatically slows progression of the TTR amyloidoses in humans will also allow us to discern how inhibition of TTR aggregation alters the cell biological and biochemical defects apparently underlying neurodegeneration in these models. To further understand the mechanisms of TTR proteotoxicity at the cellular and molecular level, we will search for modulators of TTR proteotoxicity by identifying suppressors of a locomotion defect exhibited by one of our TTR models in a unbiased forward genetic screen. We have identified candidate suppressors in a pilot screen and showed that some exhibited proper TTR synthesis and secretion, suggesting that this screen could identify tissue specific molecular targets that are relays between the formation of extracellular TTR aggregates and cellular toxicity. These studies will establish TTR C. elegans models as relevant to the study of cell non-autonomous TTR toxicity."
"9485964","I. Introduction and Progress: A major goal of the ND INBRE in the current funding cycle was to establish bioinformatics expertise to serve the ND INBRE partners. In the early funding cycles of BRIN and INBRE, the ND INBRE bioinformatics program focused on the introduction and improvement of the electronic library resources that would be necessary to serve biomedical research in ND. At this early juncture in the program, there was both limited internet access and electronic library resources in ND. As detailed in the previous competing renewal, this goal was successfully accomplished by ND INBRE and all INBRE partners now have electronic access to the UNO Library system. Due to these advances, a major goal of the ND INBRE in the current grant cycle was to establish the foundation for the development of bioinformatics in ND through recruitment and development of bioinformatics faculty. In the current funding cycle, the ND INBRE challenged both Research Intensive Universities in ND to participate with the ND INBRE to develop a Bioinformatics Core to serve the educational and research needs of our partners throughout the state. As part of this challenge, the ND INBRE committed $125,000 a year to each RIU to assist each in joining the ND INBRE in this important endeavor of infrastructure building and a central goal of the IDeA program.  The Dean of the SMHS took full advantage of this opportunity. Foremost, Dr. Wynne provided a state? supported FTE for the initial recruitment of the first bioinformatics faculty member at the UNO SMHS. This allowed ND INBRE funds committed to this appointment to be used to support the development of the faculty member and the Bioinformatics Core facility. The UNO SMHS successfully recruited Dr. Ke Zhang into the Department of Pathology to supervise the ND INBRE Bioinformatics Core. Dr. Zhang and ND INBRE initially equipped the facility with a Dell PowerEdge R910 4U rack server that has four Intel Xeon X7550 CPUs and 512 GB RAM. This R910 server allows parallel computation of 64 processes simultaneously. To date, this server has enabled the core to fulfill most of the required tasks for bioinformatics research and education. The R910 is a single-node server and a major advantage of R910 is that it has a large shared memory (500 GB) that allows development of computational algorithms with a large data structure. This Dell R910 server is valuable and will remain a valuable part of the Bioinformatics Core. The R910 server will continue to be used for methodology development and student training.  Due to the success of the ND INBRE Bioinformatics Core, this server was becoming a limiting factor for meeting the computational requirements for the fast-growing area of genomic data-sets. As a result, the ND INBRE in early 2013, in combination with other internal resources of the PI at the UNO SMHS, purchased a cluster server in order to meet the computational challenges in the Bioinformatics Core. The cluster server will be used for computationally intensive tasks such as processing next generation sequencing data. The Summary Configuration of the cluster server is: 16 Compute Nodes, 2 Intel MIC chips, Gigabit Networking, and Rack with Power Distribution. Additional information on specifics is available below and on the ND INBRE website under Bioinformatics. The support of a major portion of Dr. Zhang's salary by the Dean of the SMHS also allowed important ND INBRE resources to be re-deployed to support the research and core duties of Dr. Zhang. These resources were used by Dr. Zhang to employ on average 3 computer science undergraduates and 2 computer science graduate students to support core function. In addition to employment, many students are pursuing research projects with Dr. Zhang. The SMHS and the Department of Pathology have provided Dr. Zhang 450 sq. ft. of space to support his undergraduate and graduate personnel. Each student has independent desk space that is equipped with a Dell computer and required software. The impact of this support is effectively illustrated by the numerous publications and presentations produced by Dr. Zhang since his arrival at UNO SMHS. These resources also supported his scholarly activity and service requirements necessary to compete effectively on the academic tenure track. Dr. Zhang is also a participant on a new R01 award in excess of $1.2 million.  As detailed in the progress report, UNO SMHS institutional support to the Bioinformatics Core by Dr. Wynne, the Dean of the SMHS and Vice President for Health Affairs, will exceed $900,000 over the current 5year funding cycle. This is a return of over 100% of the direct investment of funds by the ND INBRE."
"9533964","OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION ? Project Summary/Abstract The Impact of Weather and Pollution on Mortality, Morbidity, and Health Care Cost  Each year, the Medicare program spends around half a trillion dollars on providing healthcare for the elderly. Growth in health care expenditure is placing growing pressure on the Medicare Trust Fund, and accurate projections of future health care needs and spending are necessary to properly plan for the future needs of the aging population. The prospect of climate change affecting weather and pollution makes these links even more policy-relevant.  Previous studies of environmental impacts on health have largely focused on mortality and hospital admissions. Other important outcomes, such as the physical and mental health of survivors and the cost of medical utilization following extreme events, have been limited, primarily due to a lack of appropriate data. This project will document the impact of temperature and pollution on elder health and health care use in the U.S. by linking, for the first time, individual-level medical treatment histories derived from Medicare claims with temperature and pollution data for the years 1992 through 2011. These data permit identifying which groups are particularly vulnerable to environmental shocks and quantifying the cost of medical utilization in response to temperature or pollution changes, a cost of climate change that has been previously unmeasured. We will document the extent to which individuals adapt to prevailing local conditions (e.g., heat or pollution), mitigating the impact of environmental shocks. Linking the Medicare and environmental data to demographic data and housing characteristics, we will investigate how income and housing characteristics such as air conditioning modify the relationship between environment and health. We will also make use of two new sources of quasi- experimental variation in pollution?smoke from wildfires and variation in local wind conditions?that help overcome the limitations of observational studies and allow us to estimate the causal impact of pollution on health and cost outcomes.  Specifically, this project will pursue four goals: (1) Produce large-scale and comprehensive evidence on the causal relationship between temperature/pollution and mortality, morbidity, and Medicare costs; (2) Identify which elderly subpopulations (e.g., the poor, very aged or those living with disabilities or chronic illness) are the most vulnerable to extreme events and measure the number of life-years lost in an extreme event rather than just raw mortality counts; (3) Investigate the role of adaptation in modifying the environment-health relationship; and (4) Estimate the impact that climate change will have on elderly health and Medicare spending. This study will achieve these goals by compiling a novel dataset with two decades of daily temperature and pollution levels in an individual's zip code of residence linked to detailed measures of individual-level health, health care utilization, and medical costs and demographic data from the Census and other sources."
"9590743","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplantation remains a palliative therapy with few recipients achieving survival beyond 20 years. Early results have improved secondary to reductions in perioperative mortality and early acute rejection rates have also fallen. However, ongoing graft loss occurs at a steady state of 2-3% per year after the first year with 'chronic rejection' being the commonest cause of late graft loss. Current medication regimens are effective at preventing acute rejection but appear to be largely ineffective at preventing graft vasculopathy. Our failure to make strides in this area reflects our ignorance of the mechanisms driving this serious complication. An emerging literature suggests that donor-specific HLA antibodies (DSA) are key drivers of chronic graft loss, and nonadherence may play an important role in their development. There is also a mounting body of literature to suggest that immunity to self-antigens plays an important role in the development of graft vasculopathy, though this has not been studied in children. We aim to address the complex interplay between alloimmunity, autoimmunity and nonadherence. We will address these themes through three interrelated studies. Project 1 is an observational cohort study to determine the long-term impact of DSA (preformed versus de novo) and antibodies to self-antigens (cardiac myosin, vimentin) on chronic graft function. We will also evaluate the impact of allo- and autoantibodies on the incidence of late (>1 year) serious adverse events including death, acute rejection, and acute graft dysfunction. Risk factors for outcomes will be defined, and the molecular pathology of late rejection episodes will be evaluated. The impact of antibodies on the development of altered microvascular pathophysiology will be assessed through evaluation of endothelial cell structure and signaling, interstitial capillary network and obliterative microvasculopathy (arteriolopathy). Innovative multiplex labeling, automated image analysis and endothelial cell culture models will be used to accomplish this endpoint. We hypothesize that de novo DSA will be the strongest predictors of adverse outcomes and development of microvasculopathy and that nonadherence will drive this complication. Project 2 will be a randomized, controlled trial of a novel mobile device application (Teen Pocket PATH) to improve adherence in children greater than 11 years of age after heart transplantation. We hypothesize that the intervention will improve adherence to medications and will reduce acute rejection events. We also hypothesize that this will lead to less de novo production of allo- and autoantibodies. Project 3 will be a phase II non-randomized, open label trial of a bortezomib-based regimen for desensitization of highly sensitized pediatric heart transplant candidates to assess the safety of the regimen in a pediatric population and to assess efficacy via evaluation of calculated PRA, antibody strength and complement fixing ability/IgG subclass and proportion of patients with negative cross-match against donor on pre- versus post-treatment sera. We hypothesize that a bortezomib-based regimen will be effective in reducing anti-HLA antibodies and reducing calculated PRA."
"9477503","ABSTRACT  In this application we propose to study clonal heterogeneity at the single cell level using transcriptomic and  mutational data. However, this approach must be accompanied by the development of effective mathematical  and computational techniques to visualize and extract meaningful biological and clinical information. Single  cell approaches ? and indeed all high-throughput biological data, whether generated through sequencing,  proteomics, or imaging ? generate large, multivariate collections of data and therefore require methods for  identifying the most biologically and clinical relevant features. The Mathematical Core aims to extract robust  patterns in large-scale genomic data, using a set of recently developed techniques in algebraic topology,  evolutionary moduli spaces and causal networks. Our group is pioneering the development and large-scale  genomic application of topological data analysis (TDA), a new mathematical framework for capturing global  structural properties of large data sets that is particularly well suited for high-dimensional, high-throughput  biological data. This core aims to extend this work and to develop and implement mathematical approaches to  tackle the inherent complexity and biological interpretability of single cell approaches to cancer evolution and  heterogeneity. In order to develop an appropriately expressive language, we will rely on ideas from topology  (phylogenetic moduli spaces and TDA), modal logic, model-checking algorithms, and a probabilistic theory of  causality. These tools complement each other and will be further developed in the context of single cell data  and applied in the specific research projects of this proposal. In particular, the proposed methods will be  calibrated and evaluated in Project 1 and tested using single cell data in primary tumors in Project 2 and in the  context of therapy in Project 3."
"9528181","Malaria remains a significant public health concern and is responsible for more than 400,000 deaths annually, most of which occur in African children under the age of five. The majority of malaria infections remain asymptomatic; only a small percentage progress to clinical symptoms and an even smaller proportion of these progress to a life-threatening disease. The host and parasite factors leading to this clinical heterogeneity are not well described or well understood.  Our hypothesis is that the speed with which a malaria infection develops and the total number of parasites present in the body are important determinants of disease severity. Variables related to parasite dynamics cannot currently be measured in the human host and ex vivo measurements do not reflect in vivo reality. This proposal will take advantage of a unique set of parasitological and patient specimens collected over the past several decades in Blantyre, Malawi to develop more robust and accurate estimates of two important measures of parasite dynamics: total body parasite load and parasite multiplication rate. ? Total body parasite load (TBPL): We will use tissue samples from children who died of cerebral malaria to  quantify parasites in the most heavily parasitized organs and then extrapolate to the parasite load present  in the entire body. This will create a new estimate of TBPL grounded in actual histological parasite counts. ? Parasite multiplication rate (PMR): Current estimates of PMR rely on removing the parasites from the host  and testing their replication in culture, inevitably introducing culture-related artifact. We propose to use a  novel method based on parasite-produced proteins with different half-lives to calculate PMR in vivo.  We will then use clinical samples from well-characterized individuals at both extremes of the infection spectrum, asymptomatic parasitemia and cerebral malaria, in order to build a model to test the hypothesis that PMR and TBPL are important determinants of disease severity.  If our hypothesis is correct and these parameters are related to disease severity, prognostic tests based on these metrics could lead to the real-time in vivo detection of high-risk malaria infections. Improved prognosis would lead, in turn, to earlier triage, and ultimately, a decrease in malaria morbidity and mortality. In addition, these measures of parasite dynamics would represent pathogenic processes that could be used to identify druggable targets. Should this hypothesis not hold true, we will still have generated novel, robust measures of in vivo parasite activity, which will be useful in characterizing the interactions of parasites with the host immune system as well as defining inter-clone competition within a host."
"9581499","ABSTRACT Our goal is to develop and apply chemical biological methodologies that will assist in the identification and characterization of gut microbiome enzymes responsible for the degradation of the gut mucus. The intestinal tract harbors an enormous and diverse collection of commensal bacteria, termed the gut microbiome, that are essential for metabolism, immune development and homeostasis, and epithelial cell angiogenesis. In healthy individuals, the majority of microbes are held at bay in the gut lumen by the steady secretion of mucus, which primarily consists of crosslinked and heavily O-glycosylated mucin proteins. In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn?s disease, the gut microbes manage to infiltrate the host intestinal mucin protein core, epithelium, and lamina propria. The resulting recognition of microbial constituents by the host?s innate and adaptive immune responses drives the intestinal inflammation that is associated with all forms of IBD. We posit that progression from a healthy state to colitis commences via microbial erosion of the mucus layer and that colitis-associated gut microbes, including pathogenic and infectious bacteria and viruses (i.e., C. difficile, cytomegalovirus), harbor aberrant protein functionalities that are far more adept at host mucus layer degradation than microbes found in healthy individuals. Our hypothesis is supported by recent discoveries that, in murine models of colitis, elevated levels of sialic acid-degrading enzymatic activity are found. In this proposal, we will focus on elucidating microbial proteins that recognize and degrade sialic acid, an abundant and the most terminally expressed carbohydrate on mucus glycans. We believe that, while the many layers of mucus glycans beneath sialic acid aid in microbial defense in healthy individuals, removal of sialic acid is the first overall step in microbial infiltration of the gut. To test this hypothesis, we have developed UV-photoactivatable sialic acid-based chemical probes that irreversibly label all host and bacterial proteins from microbiome samples capable of binding sialic acid (i.e., sialidases, lectins, transporters, transferases). All probe-bound proteins are subjected to affinity-based enrichment and subsequent protein identification and quantitation with mass spectrometry (MS). Here, we will employ our sialic acid probes and innovative methods to a well-established adoptive T cell transfer murine model of chronic colitis and directly compare our metaproteomics results to those obtained from control mice raised under identical conditions. Differences observed between healthy and colitic mice may implicate which enzymes are critical for human IBD and assist in achieving our long-term goal of identifying microbial proteins that promote colitis. Importantly, we are well qualified to accomplish our proposed aim, as the Wolan laboratory spearheaded the development and application of chemical probes and MS-based metaproteomics to find the bacterial cysteine proteases that are overly abundant in colitic microbiomes. The probes, methods, and results generated here will lead to exciting new opportunities for studying host-microbe interactions."
"9477506","TITLE  Project 3: Predicting therapeutic sensitivity in cancer.  ABSTRACT  Somatic genetic alterations in cancer have been linked with response to targeted therapeutics and resistance  to therapy. Methods that model and predict therapeutic sensitivity of cancer can be extremely useful in the  development of more effective treatments. Our goal is to model, predict, and target therapeutic sensitivity and  resistance of cancer. Our proposed approach is to utilize 3-dimensional (3-D) models of glioblastoma  (gliomaspheres, GS) that recapitulate the nature of genetics lesions in primary tumors to experimentally  validate computational Machine Learning predictions based on genomic information. Our approach in Aim 1 is  to build a computational framework that incorporates genomic data, drug properties and responses, and known  drug targets and network models of pathways and protein complexes to predict the therapeutic response of 80  genomically annotated GSs. Then, in Aim 2 we will experimentally validate our computational predictions of  therapeutic sensitivity across the library of GSs, test combinatorial predictions, and examine the molecular  mechanisms by which candidate genes alter drug responses. Single or multi-lesion sensitivity will be evaluated  by RNA interference or cDNA overexpression. Finally, we will investigate the role of cell heterogeneity in the  mechanism of drug resistance at the single cell level using topological methods, developed in Project 2 and in  the Mathematical Core. The ultimate goal of our studies will be to uncover mechanistic insights into genotype-  dependent sensitivity to drugs or synthetic lethal relationships. Ultimately, our studies will deliver key  information for the development of multiple gene- and pathway-based biomarkers for personalized cancer  therapies."
"9697907","Abstract Exposure to ambient air pollution has been linked to annually 7 million premature deaths worldwide and 200,000 in the US and the global burden of air pollution is likely to increase due to increasing urbanization and industrialization. Extensive research has shown that exposure to particulate air pollution and specifically fine particulates (PM2.5) increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, despite this extensive evidence, it is unclear how PM2.5 exposure increases the cardiometabolic risk and which susceptible states increase the sensitivity to vascular and cardiometabolic injury due to PM2.5 exposure. In our proposed studies we attempt to disentangle the mechanism leading to the toxicity of PM2.5 by testing the novel hypothesis that PM2.5 disrupts vascular circadian rhythms and that this contributes to the development of cardiometabolic disease in a new susceptibility state of circadian dyssynchrony. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary data showing that that exposure to concentrated ambient PM2.5 (CAP) alters the rhythmic expression of clock genes in the murine aorta and increases insulin resistance in mice with the disturbed light/dark cycle (circadian dyssynchrony). As this models a real-world scenario in which individuals with disturbed light cycle (e.g. due to light pollution, sleep deprivation) are exposed to air pollution it is of high relevance to our modern urban 24 h lifestyle associated with air and light pollution and changes in sleep behavior. Successful completion of this project will identify new targets of and novel susceptibility states (circadian dyssynchrony and chronotoxicity) for PM2.5 toxicity. Results of theses studies will be of significance in understanding the adverse health effects originated from our modern lifestyle and could ultimately lead to the development of evidence-based guidelines and policies to minimize the cardiometabolic effects of urbanization and pollutant exposure."
"9526381","Project Summary Mitochondrial function declines with age and is exacerbated in disease states such as Parkinson's. One potential cause of the mitochondrial decline is the propagation of deleterious mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) throughout an organism's lifetime as has been observed in individual muscle cells or dopaminergic neurons. mtDNAs only encode respiratory chain and ATP synthase components and thus lesions result in oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) deficiency. Because mtDNAs exist at 100s-1000s of copies per cell, a lesion in a single genome is well tolerated. However, if the deleterious genome accumulates to greater than ~60%, pathology related to OxPhos dysfunction ensues including cell degeneration and death. It is currently unclear how deleterious mtDNAs are maintained, how they are propagated and ultimately why they are toxic. One mechanism by which cells respond to OxPhos deficiency is by activating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), which initiates a mitochondrial repair and recovery program. We have found that UPRmt activation provides protection against OxPhos deficiencies caused by nuclear mutations in OxPhos genes or against bacterial derived toxins (P. aeruginosa produces cyanide for example). Our surprising preliminary data indicate that the UPRmt is required to maintain and propagate deleterious mtDNAs in a C. elegans model of heteroplasmy. Therefore, we hypothesize that deleterious mtDNAs are selfish, or parasitic, and take advantage of an endogenous stress response program in place to repair and respond to mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we plan to examine the consequences of UPRmt activation and deleterious mtDNA propagation as a contributor to age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction."
"9463133","Project Summary Tetherin is an interferon-inducible, antiviral protein with an extraordinarily broad mechanism of action. This cell- surface protein anchors budding viral particles to the cell surface as they emerge from the plasma membrane, preventing release from the cell. `Tethered? virions are endocytosed and destroyed, and tetherin also initiates a signal transduction cascade that triggers expression of additional innate immune defenses. Thus, tetherin is both a sensor and an effector, with the potential to inhibit all enveloped viruses that acquire their membranes by budding from the plasma membrane. This begs the question: how does the majority of enveloped viruses adapt to, and overcome, tetherin-mediated restriction? Tetherin's mechanism does not entail a specific interaction with a viral protein or gene product, making it difficult or impossible for viruses to escape directly by mutation and selection. A review of the now abundant literature reveals that most tetherin studies have focused on a few viruses encoding accessory proteins with known anti-tetherin functions. These include HIV and SIV, which use their Vpu and Nef accessory proteins, respectively, to reduce cell-surface tetherin levels. In contrast, the vast majority of retroviruses do not encode known or obvious accessory proteins with which to counteract host tetherin, including a majority of retroviruses in the alpharetrovirus, betaretrovirus and gammaretrovirus genera. For this R21 proposal, we plan to tackle this enormous knowledge gap by focusing first on viruses of the promiscuous RDR Interference Supergroup. The RDR supergroup comprises an extraordinary collection of viruses that includes gammaretroviruses, betaretroviruses, and several endogenous retroviruses (including the human Syncytin-1 gene, which originated as an endogenous retrovirus). RDR viruses colonize hosts as diverse as primates, carnivores, and birds. This proposal takes advantage of the fact that the RDR viruses share a genetically and functionally homologous env gene, and consequently, all RDR viruses tested thus far use the same receptor for viral entry (ASCT2). We discovered that Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV), a prototypical RDR virus, uses its Env glycoprotein to antagonize the tetherin homolog of its natural host, the rhesus macaque, providing a paradigm for understanding how other simple retroviruses may overcome tetherin in their respective hosts. We hypothesize that the anti-tetherin function of MPMV Env is common among RDR retroviruses (Aim 1). By leveraging the homology and functional similarities among RDR Envs, we will map the interface between Env and tetherin (Aim 2). Finally, we will test and confirm the mechanism(s) by which Env rescues virions from tetherin- mediated restriction (Aim 3)."
"9475767","C. Abstract (Human Phenotyping) The Human Phenotyping Core (HPC) and its two sub-cores (the Energy Balance and Behavioral sub-cores) directly support the research of NORC members by providing innovative clinical and intervention services to phenotype humans in mechanistic, clinical, and translational studies. The services o f t h e Energy Balance sub-core include methods to quantify body composition, energy expenditure, carbohydrate metabolism, and cardiorespiratory fitness. The services of the Behavioral sub-core include behavioral, cognitive, and psychological assessments; measurement of food intake in laboratory and free-living conditions; design and delivery of behavioral change interventions; and assessment of activity and sedentary behavior in free- living conditions. Over the first 10 years of NORC funding, the HPC: a) provided comprehensive services for human phenotyping in clinical research studies, b) developed and validated innovative phenotyping methods and interventions, c) established quality control procedures, and d) built a growing base of HPC users. In years 1-5, the majority of the HPC's effort focused on adult phenotyping. Over years 6-10, however, the HPC transitioned to include g reater emphasis on novel imaging techniques and methods to phenotype mothers, infants, and children. This is consistent with the NORC's theme of nutrition, obesity, and metabolic health through the lifespan. At each period of the lifespan, we conduct research to understand the mechanisms, prevention, and treatment of obesity; and our research focus areas have evolved to include a) maternal and infant nutritional status, b) pediatric and adulthood obesity, and c) nutritional status in older age to preserve physical and cognitive functionality. The Aims of the current renewal application to fund years 11-15 are: 1) provide members with a comprehensive suite of innovative energy balance and behavioral services to ongoing funded and collaborative research projects to enable the characterization of human subjects in clinical and translational research studies, and continue to expand services to phenotype individuals at specific stages of life, such as pregnancy and infancy, 2) provide specialist expertise to support clinical and translational research on nutrition, obesity and metabolic health at different stages of life, and continue to enhance our quality control procedures to provide efficient and high quality services, 3) sustain a human tissue bio-repository, including metabolic tissues (muscle, adipose) and biospecimens that are needed for ongoing fundamental and translational studies of nutrition, obesity, and metabolic health relative to pregnancy (placenta, cord blood), infancy (breast milk), and childhood, 4) expand imaging capabilities including food-intake-relevant fMRI, enhanced body composition and metabolism, and rodent imaging to increase the power and quality of our research results, and 5) proactively facilitate increased utilization of the core services; integrate core services with pilot and feasibility studies; and continually monitor and improve utilization and priorities for core services. These aims build upon the previous 10 years of work and bolster support for NORC members' research."
"9471821","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the initial events contributing to the development of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) remain elusive, mounting evidence supports a crucial role for the innate immune system and environmental factors, such as viruses, in the progression of disease. Further investigation is needed to understand how innate immune activation leads to loss of immunological tolerance and ensuing beta cell destruction by the CD8+ T cell. Therefore, the long- term goal of this research is to understand the causal relationship between genetic susceptibility, precipitating environmental factors, and innate immune mediators in the initiation and progression of T1D. This particular application aims to assess the effect of Type 1 Interferons (T1-IFN) on beta cell and CD8+ T cell interactions in a human in vitro model of T1D. Previous studies have shown that T1-IFN are found in the islets of T1D patients along with increased MHC Class I (MHC-I) expression. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to increased MHC-I within the beta cell have not been well characterized. Also, due to the immunomodulatory effects displayed by T1-IFN, the presence of these cytokines within the diabetic islet may serve to modulate CD8+ T cell responses. The central hypothesis portends that T1-IFN alter the microenvironment of the diabetic islet through regulation of members of the MHC-I antigen processing and presentation pathway and by directly enhancing CTL-mediated beta cell death. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims: 1) Determine how T1-IFN regulate MHC-I antigen processing & presentation by beta cells; and 2) Elucidate the impact of T1-IFN on beta cell recognition and destruction by autoreactive CD8+ T cells. In Aim 1, utilizing beta cell lines and primary human islets, mechanistic studies aimed at characterizing the antigen processing and presentation pathway, specifically the immunoproteasome, will be performed.     This will be followed by in depth analysis of signaling pathways responsible for inducing these responses in beta cells. Expounding upon preliminary studies, aim 2 will investigate the immunomodulatory effects of T1-IFN in the context of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity, specifically factors involved in the granule exocytosis pathway and TNF receptor ligand family. Furthermore, T1-IFN mediated signaling pathways important for the acquisition of CD8+ T cell effector function will be analyzed. A majority of the current knowledge regarding T1-IFN biology has been derived using other disease models. This research is innovative in that it seeks to understand existing paradigms in T1-IFN biology in the context of T1D autoimmunity. This research is significant because successful completion of these studies will provide direct evidence as to how T1-IFN modulate beta cell - CD8 T cell interactions and will provide a mechanistic link between environmental factors, immune activation, and T1D pathogenesis. Ultimately, the knowledge gained here will serve as a foundation for future studies examining the functional significance of T1D susceptibility alleles in T1-IFN responsiveness, which may lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches in T1D that specifically target the T1-IFN signaling pathway."
"9627145","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurocognitive disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) are major public health problems that may disproportionately affect Latinos compared to other Americans. Extant dementia literature from outstanding neuroepidemiologic work indicates that some Latino ancestry groups may have a four-fold increased risk of dementing disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) compared to other Latino groups. The reasons for these striking differences in dementia estimates have not been addressed; represent a major gap in the health scientific literature; and form a major barrier to progress in better understanding dementias among diverse Latino populations. Furthermore, less is known about midlife factors associated with early and pathological neurocognitive deficits and disordrs, regardless of ethnicity/race. Insights from middle-aged and older Latino populations will open new opportunities for mitigating further neurocognitive disorder and related disabilities. Logistically and economically, sampling sufficient numbers of major Latino groups (e.g., Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans) for well-powered neuroepidemiologic work is prohibitive and forms additional barriers to progress in the field. As an invited Ancillary Study of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SOL; n=16,415 at baseline), this proposed project designated as the Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA) would efficiently fill major gaps in the neuroepidemiology Mild Cognitive Impairment/Mild Neurocognitive Disorders (MCI/mNCD). SOL-INCA would examine associations between shared genetic and cardiovascular disease risk factors for neurocognitive deficits and disorders (i.e., MCI/mNCD) among SOL's middle-aged and older Latino subsample (n=9,652 at baseline). Additionally, SOL-INCA would begin to unveil the sociocultural risks and protective factors that may contribute the striking differences in dementia previously found between Latino ancestry groups. SOL-INCA would be integrated into Visit 2 to collect a second time-point of neurocognitive data from returning SOL middle-aged and older Latinos participants (ages 50-80 years old; 2015-2020). We believe that the SOL-INCA approach would enable us to discover behaviorally, culturally appropriate, and biologically plausible targets and means for mitigating early neurocognitive disorders. Our long-term is to translate our findings into actionable means for preventing or delaying milder forms of neurocognitive disorders from evolving into more severe disordered states, especially in Latinos who may be at increased risk for these disorders."
"9555386","Dr. Hidekazu (Hide) Tsukamoto continues to make significant contributions to the Medical Research Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs at two distinct levels: first as a Research Physiologist who makes cutting-edge discoveries on molecular cellular mechanisms of liver fibrosis and cancer; and secondly as a Center Director of the P50 national center program on alcoholic liver and pancreatic diseases (ALPD) and cirrhosis who renders concrete and outcome-oriented support for scientific endeavors of VA investigators regionally and across the nation.  He published 71 peer-review articles in the last 10 years and maintained federal grants with total current direct costs exceeding $1.1M per year (not inclusive of all center components). He has made major contributions to new knowledge concerning morphogen-mediated regulation of cell fate of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), hepatic macrophages, and tumor-initiating stem-like cells (TICs), the cell types shown to play critical roles in liver fibrosis, inflammation, and cancer, respectively. In these regulations, novel modes of metabolic reprogramming were disclosed as underlying mechanisms. More specifically, Notch-mediated proinflammatory M1 activation of liver macrophages is causally linked to mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming (J Clin Invest 2015;125:1579-90). Wnt-induced activation of HSCs is mediated by lipid metabolic reprogramming involving stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) (Gastroenterology 2017;152:1477-91). Further, SCD expressed by HSCs is shown to achieve tumor-promoting lipid reprogramming in microenvironment to enhance liver tumor progression.  Programmatically, he continues to direct a nationally renowned P50 center program on alcoholic liver and pancreatic diseases and a R24 core program on integrative liver cell techniques which support leading-edge ALPD research. Through these programs, he collaborated and supported 12 VA investigators and mentored 10 junior faculty members during the current cycle of the VARCS award.  In essence, the efforts Dr. Tsukamoto makes, render individual and collective impacts on science pursed by him and many VA investigators across the nation and help identify therapeutic targets for ALPD and cirrhosis which are prevalent in VA patients."
"9482691","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks five years of support to collect new two waves of data (2014-2019) from a panel of nearly 400 couples who participated in earlier waves of the Family Transitions Project (FTP; 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1994) and the Midlife Transition Project (MTP; 2001). The purpose of returning to this panel is to document the continuity and change in couple relationships and health (broadly defined to include mental and physical health) over transition from middle to later years. The data assembled under FTP and MTP are now being augmented by a third project, a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS), whereby genetic data are being collected from the same adults. Nearly all of the participants are baby-boomers who are in their retirement years. Adding new two waves of data to these past waves provides a wealth of prospective data on men and women as they currently transition through the retirement years.  Previous research on the continuity and change in couple relationships and health over elder years is mixed. This may be attributed to the limited ability of previous studies to investigate the couples' interactions and relationship quality withi the contexts of long-term couple relationships and life histories, and the failure to take spouses' work and economic circumstances into account. Furthermore, most studies on couples' relationship in elder years have not been able to capitalize on new research regarding genetic markers. The proposed study is well-positioned to address these concerns. By combining new data with the earlier data described above, we will have extensive information on couples collected over a 25 year period. The data will include intensive assessments of marital, economic, and work histories, parental experiences, social status, support, and physical and mental health as well as genotypic information. This comprehensive perspective and the 'long-term view' offer the prospect of resolving contradictions in existing research. We will place the transition from midlife to later adulthood in a long-term life course and family contexts and examine continuity and change in couple relationships and health. We will also take into account the moderating effects of enduring vulnerabilities including those attributable to genetic markers. We will use the cutting-edge analytical techniques that have been the hallmark of our past research."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This four-year K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide me with advanced training and mentorship to become an independent investigator in implementation research, integrating methods from epidemiology, social science, and economics to increase engagement of young female sex workers (FSW) in HIV prevention services. My long-term goal is to become a leading investigator in implementation research that addresses health disparities in HIV prevention and care among hard-to-reach populations, with a focus on young key populations. The proposed work includes training and research that capitalize on the rich interdisciplinary research environment of RTI International. Training represents the foundation of this proposal and includes senior mentors and advisors with complementary expertise, didactic education, skills development, and mentored research so that at the completion of the award I will be well positioned for an independent research career. The training plan was developed in parallel with the mentored research plan to ensure that newly acquired knowledge and skills are immediately applied to the relevant aspects of the research project. The following objectives will be accomplished during this award: (1) obtain training and practical skills in implementation research methods, including methods to improve and evaluate implementation and delivery of combination health interventions in order to increase demand, uptake, retention and compliance to services by young key populations; (2) obtain training and practical skills in costing and cost-effectiveness analysis of combination health interventions; (3) become an independent investigator in implementation research by contributing to the field through scientific publications, being mentored by subject matter experts, and generating pilot data for a future R-series award. The goal of the proposed research component is to comprehensively evaluate a multicomponent HIV prevention project in Zimbabwe targeting young FSW <25 years of age, to determine methods of delivery that result in the highest uptake, retention, and compliance. Young FSW are a vulnerable population at greater risk for HIV acquisition than their older counterparts, yet thei engagement in HIV services remains low. Funding has been secured to implement an evidence-based, HIV prevention pilot project for young FSW, integrated within Zimbabwe's National Sex Worker Programme (NSWP) clinics. This research will comprehensively evaluate the pilot project at 8 NSWP clinics, benefitting from the infrastructure, resources, and wealth of programmatic data available from all 36 NSWP sites nationally. Specific aims are to: (1) determine barriers and facilitators to implementation and uptake of the HIV prevention pilot project; (2) implement and evaluate the pilot project using a randomized stepped wedge design; and (3) estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of the different HIV prevention components. This study will provide quantitative and qualitative evidence to determine if a future trial to scae up and evaluate the intervention's effectiveness/cost-effectiveness is warranted."
"9602202","Summary The goal of our research is to understand how defects in calcium influx in cells of the immune system cause immunodeficiency in patients with inherited mutations in genes regulating calcium influx. Since the same patients also suffer from anemia caused by autoantibodies against red blood cells, a second goal of our research is to understand how calcium influx maintains immunological self-tolerance and prevents autoimmunity. Our central hypothesis is that CRAC channels, which mediate calcium influx across the cell membrane, are required for the function of different cells in the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system that provide immunity to infection and prevent autoimmunity. CRAC channels are the main source of calcium influx in most immune cells. They are formed by the channel protein ORAI1 and are activated by STIM1 and STIM2. We have identified the first patients with mutations in ORAI1 and STIM1 genes who suffer from a disease we called CRAC channelopathy that is characterized by immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and several non-immunological defects. Because CRAC channelopathy is a rare disease and patient samples are limited, we generated mice that lack CRAC channels in T cells. By investigating immune responses in these mice and by validating key results in samples of patients with CRAC channelopathy, we have been able to define a critical role of CRAC channels in T cell-mediated immune responses, in particular for cellular and antibody-mediated immunity to infection and for limiting immune responses during chronic infection that would otherwise cause harmful inflammation. However, we are still far from having a complete picture of how CRAC channels regulate immunity to infection. Beyond T cells, CRAC channels may also regulate innate immune responses mediated by dendritic cells and neutrophils. Studies so far have yielded conflicting data whether CRAC channels are required for innate immune cell function, and their role for innate immunity to infection has not been studied. Besides immunity to infection, CRAC channels are essential for immunological self-tolerance by controlling the development of regulatory T cells, which suppress the function of other immune cells and thereby prevent autoimmunity. CRAC channel-deficient patients have fewer Treg cells, potentially explaining their autoimmunity. How CRAC channels control the function of Treg cells and prevent autoimmunity is not understood. To address these questions, we propose the following three specific aims: (1) We will analyze inherited defects in ORAI1 and STIM1 genes of patients to understand the role of CRAC channels for immune function and the molecular regulation of CRAC channels. (2) We will determine if CRAC channels are required for innate immune responses by dendritic cells and neutrophils to fight bacterial and fungal infections. (3) We will determine how CRAC channels control regulatory T cell function and prevent autoimmunity, in particular autoimmune hemolytic anemia, by studying CRAC channel-deficient mice and patients. Our studies will provide fundamental insights how CRAC channels regulate immunity to infection and prevent autoimmunity."
"9529810","ABSTRACT Infectious diseases continue to pose a major threat to worldwide human health and lead to significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Viral respiratory tract infection (VRTI) is the most common illness in humans, and non-influenza-related VTRI costs amount to over $40 billion annually in the United States alone. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is among the leading causes of pediatric death secondary to pneumonia worldwide. Rapid diagnosis is critical for early and accurate treatment, as well as initiation and reduction of transmission, eventually leading to reduced hospital stays, antibiotic over-prescription, and taxing limited laboratory resources. Current diagnostic methods rely on time-consuming laboratory-based tests including virus culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and rapid diagnostic tests are not sufficiently sensitive as standalone diagnosis. This paradox raises the need for rapid and ultrasensitive diagnostic tests. The plasmonic coupling assay is a rapid colorimetric diagnostic test that changes color from red to purple when plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) get in close proximity of each other following antibody binding or DNA hybridization. Despite its easy operation, the sensitivity of the colorimetric plasmonic coupling assay is limited. In this proposed work, we aim to dramatically improve the analytical sensitivity of the plasmonic coupling assay using an innovative digital nanobubble detection method. Specifically, we propose to directly detect RSV particles with antibody-conjugated AuNPs that recognize the RSV surface fusion protein. AuNPs bind to multiple RSV surface fusion proteins and lead to plasmonic coupling. Ultrashort laser pulse selectively activates coupled AuNPs due to their enhanced absorption compared with a single AuNP. This greater optical absorption leads to nanoscale cavitation bubbles, i.e. nanobubbles, which can be measured easily from their intense scattering. Single nanobubble generation leads to a sensitive digital detection with ?on? and ?off? signals. Our preliminary results suggests at least 3 orders of magnitude improvement in analytical sensitivity with a similar bioassay for nucleic acid detection. Our specific aims are: (1) to optimize the AuNP size and concentration for RSV detection using the digital nanobubble detection and establish the specificity and storage stability of the assay; and (2) to build and test a prototype device for automated digital nanobubble detection using micro lasers, compact optical components, and a capillary-driven flow device. The direct detection of virus particles eliminates the need for extensive sample preparation such as nucleic acid extraction. This is a high-reward project with a bold idea and corresponding robust preliminary data to address a major healthcare need for rapid and ultrasensitive diagnostic platforms for RSV and possibly other VTRI. The ultimate goal of our project is to develop rapid and ultrasensitive diagnostic tests with potential to replace current viral culture and PCR based laboratory tests."
"9458102","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NF-KB signaling pathway represents an attractive therapeutic target for chronic inflammation as it regulates many gene products that control the inflammatory response. However, generalized suppression of this pathway can result in serious host toxicity, as NF-KB is a major mediator of both innate and adaptive immunity. We have formulated, characterized, and evaluated a novel peptide-siRNA construct that is self-condensing, stable in serum, and delivers oligonucleotides to the cell cytoplasm with an intrinsic endosomal releasing mechanism based on a modified version of the amphipathic cationic peptide melittin, a component of bee venom that normally forms pores in membrane by oligomerization. We showed that the modified melittin could be conjugated to myriad cargos and transport materials rapidly into the cell cytoplasm for efficient gene silencing: The peptide-siRNA complexes targeting the NF-KB p65 canonical subunit homed to the inflamed paws through leaky vasculature and potently suppressed ongoing inflammation in a murine model of RA. Extensive in vivo and ex vivo studies also suggest that the platform has a favorable toxicity profile and did not elicit immunogenicity after repeated dosing. In this proposal we will use the peptide-siRNA platform to explore the hypothesis that a dual approach (targeting both NF-KB canonical and non-canonical pathways) will have synergistic or additive benefits in the treatment of RA. To that end we will formulate and optimize peptide- siRNA constructs containing NF-KB-p65 (canonical), p52/100 (non-canonical), or a combination of both and test their efficiency for NF-KB signaling pathway knockdown in vitro in human/murine cell lines and in vivo in two murine models of inflammatory arthritis. The results will provide in vivo proof-of-concept for this new peptide- siRNA platform and the success will justify further development of this system for other disease processes that are amenable to RNA interference therapy."
"9528423","Project Summary/Abstract Microglia are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and recent genetic studies have identified several microglial-enriched genes that influence AD risk. To study the role of these genes in AD our lab recently developed a fully-defined approach to differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into microglia. However, reprogramming erases many of the key signatures of aging, making it difficult to study the interactions between AD genes, pathology, and aging with iPSC-derived cells. One recent study developed an innovative approach to address this challenge by using Progerin, a protein associated with a premature aging disorder. However, the Progerin gene, LMNA, is not normally expressed in human neurons or glia. In contrast, another form of Progeria, Cockayne Syndrome (CS), which is caused by mutations that impair DNA repair, leads to significant neurological defects. Furthermore, two of the genes that are mutated in CS, ERCC1 and ERCC5, are highly expressed in human microglia and their deletion in mice mimics key aspects of microglial aging. Given these findings, we propose to test the hypothesis that deletion or mutations of ERCC1 and ERCC5 will produce changes in iPSC-derived microglia that mimic the effects of chronological aging and impair the response of microglia to AD-associated insults. To achieve these goals, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team who bring expertise in AD iPSC modeling, CRISPR-mediated gene deletion, and microglial differentiation and analysis, RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics, and brain organoid culture systems to test following three specific aims and hypotheses: Aim 1: Examine the impact of ERCC1/5 deletions and mutations on iPSC-derived microglial function. We hypothesize that ERCC knockout and mutant microglia will exhibit an age-associated `primed' activation state with impaired homestatic activity but exacerbated inflammatory responses. Aim 2: Do ERCC1/5 deletions and mutations model the transcriptional effects of aging observed in human brain-derived microglia? We hypothesize that deletion of these genes will produce microglia that exhibit many of the transcriptional changes associated with natural brain aging. Aim 3: Defining the intrinsic versus extrinsic effects of ERCC deletion on microglial aging with brain organoid cultures. We hypothesis that both intrinsic and extrinsic signals influence microglial aging."
"9700467","PROJECT SUMMARY Current projections indicate a significant shortage of occupational health and safety professionals, including industrial hygienists, because of an imbalance between the supply and demand of suitably trained and educated professionals. Additionally, there is a disparity in the percentage of under-represented minority professionals in the occupational safety and health fields. The Tulane University industrial hygiene training program addresses these issues through its goal of providing support for industrial hygiene graduate students in the School of Public Health & Tropical Medicine MSPH-IH degree program. The MSPH industrial hygiene program began in 1980, a distance learning option was added in the early 1990s, and the program has been ABET accredited since 1996 including both the traditional on-campus and the distance learning options. Tulane also offers a graduate certificate in industrial hygiene and a PhD in environmental health science with a focus on industrial hygiene. The Industrial Hygiene graduate program curriculum is comprehensive and includes core courses from various public health disciplines and specialty courses in industrial hygiene. Courses include epidemiology, biostatistics, toxicology and risk assessment, radiological health, industrial ventilation and hazard control, physical agents, air sampling and analysis, occupational health, principles of industrial hygiene, and industrial safety. In addition, practice experience, applied research thesis, and comprehensive exam are required for completion of the degree. Since its inception, the program has graduated 203 masters students, of whom 35 were under-represented minorities. Approximately one-third of our alumni have obtained professional certification from the American Board of Industrial Hygiene. Current program students are trained and mentored by three core industrial hygiene faculty with the support of a large cadre of regular and adjunct faculty with expertise in related and ancillary disciplines including environmental health, occupational medicine, environmental epidemiology and safety science. NIOSH funded traineeships for Tulane MSPH-IH students began in 2005. In academic year 2015, 6 trainees are receiving support, 1 on campus and 5 in distance learning. Two of our current trainees are minorities. Recruitment of minority students into the Tulane program will be facilitated through continuing collaboration with Xavier University of Louisiana, an HBCU. Of our 35 minority graduates, 19 received undergraduate degrees from Xavier. The Tulane training program will continue to provide support for MSPH-IH students in on-campus and distance learning options. Tuition/fee and stipend support will be provided for selected full-time on-campus students and tuition/fee support provided for selected distance learning students. Support for trainee travel to professional conferences for attendance or presentation will also be provided. The program target is to provide support for four to six student trainees per academic year."
"9700465","Project Summary Washington State University (WSU) proposes research in Kenya to address 7 objectives in Component A, Communicable Disease, of RFA-GH-16-006. The research is organized into three projects that together address the following objectives: Project 1 (i) develop, maintain and expand surveillance systems combining population-based and facility-based demographic, morbidity and mortality surveillance; (ii) develop laboratory capacity and platforms for etiologic investigation and evaluation of novel diagnostic; Project 2 (iii) conduct studies to assess the disease burden, risk factors, and prevention of zoonotic infections; (iv) conduct surveillance and research on antimicrobial resistance; (v) conduct research on the epidemiology and ecology of arboviruses and their vectors; and Project 3 (vi) conduct socio-cultural research on knowledge, attitudes and practice related to infectious disease and acceptance of prevention methods; (vii) develop cost of disease and intervention estimates. To accomplish these objectives, WSU has assembled a team of 20 scientists derived from WSU, University of Nairobi (UON), Emory University, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), Kansas State University, and the government of Kenya. In addition, we have enlisted the infrastructural support of KEMRI, UON, and Henry Jackson Foundation. Since 2001, CDC has managed the human demographic surveillance system, rural and urban population-based infectious disease surveillance in Kenya. These platforms and the supporting laboratories were designed to assist in determining the burden of diseases and in conducting disease intervention trials. Here, WSU proposes to start by managing the platforms as-is, but also pilot new approaches to promote their fiscal sustainability. Through the platforms and other surveillance approaches, WSU will investigate the burden and risk factors of endemic and emerging diseases and antimicrobial resistance. In addition, we will conduct intervention studies to address the threats, and engage the government of Kenya to share data and advocate for policy change. Social scientists will work with the disease research team to assess the perceptions of diseases and treatment options, as well as behaviors that may affect human-human and animal-human transmission. To assess the economic burden of disease and cost-effectiveness of interventions, both direct and indirect impacts will be considered. The outcome of this project will be better understanding of level of these threats, and development of interventions that result in improvement of the health of Kenyans and reduction in global health threats."

"9675661","Biomarkers of asbestos exposure: All forms of asbestos including the amphiboles (crocidolite, amosite,  tremolite, actinolite, and anthophyllite) as well as the serpentine form chrysotile, cause mesothelioma and  cancer of the lung. Therefore, it would be highly desirable to have available sensitive and specific biomarkers  of asbestos exposure in order to assess potential inter-individual risks of developing mesothelioma or lung  cancer. In on-going studies, we are developing serum metabolomic markers of exposure to asbestos. This has  involved the implementation of nanospray ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) in combination with  high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Individual samples are extracted with a suitable solvent  (Folch extraction) then aqueous and organic phases are subjected to analysis by high resolution nanospray  UPLC-MS. Individual chromatograms are aligned using a combination of open-source and proprietary  software. Chromatograms from control samples are then interrogated against experimental samples for  differences in intensity of each MS signal. Identification of metabolites is conducted by using different modes  of MS/MS analysis. These studies have resulted in the generation of a rich data-set of biomarkers, in which a  number of metabolites are dysregulated in asbestos exposure when compared with control non-exposed  individuals. Therefore, we are poised to develop a robust biomarker panels for both asbestos exposure and  mesothelioma. We will test the hypotheses that: 1) Asbestos exposure will increase oxidative stress as  revealed by current serum oxidative stress biomarkers. (2) Metabolomics analysis of serum using ultra-high  resolution LC-MS will reveal novel biomarkers of asbestos exposure and mesothelioma that can be  characterized using modern bioanalytical techniques. (3) Profiling of human serum proteins will identify  signatures of asbestos exposure and mesothelioma. These hypotheses will be tested under the following  three Specific Aims. Aim 1: To quantify biomarkers of oxidative stress and identify and quantify differentially  secreted metabolites in the serum of human subjects exposed to asbestos, serum from subjects with  mesothelioma, and control serum from normal unexposed control subjects. Aim 2: To quantify biomarkers of  oxidative stress and identify and quantify differentially secreted metabolites in asbestos-exposed immortalized  mouse cells and serum provided by Project 4 from mice genetically engineered to develop mesothelioma  compared with isogenic non-exposed mice. Aim 3: To analyze serum HMGB1 and profile serum proteins  (SOMAmer assay) in asbestos-exposed and unexposed individuals to identify asbestos exposure biomarkers  and to analyze serum fibulin-3 as a mesothelioma biomarker to complement serum metabolomic biomarkers  obtained in Aim 1. Successful completion of these studies of asbestos exposure would have a significant  translational impact for risk assessment and management within the local community. It would have an  immediate impact on risk communication and risk management that would be rapidly translated to other  members of the SRP through the regular research meetings. It would also impact on regulators of risk  assessment and risk management. Another translational impact would be the use of biomarkers for monitoring  disease prevention and treatment as well as the identification of individuals at risk for follow-up studies. It will  be possible to identify particular individuals who have been exposed to asbestos and have a high risk profile  for careful clinical monitoring or asbestos-exposed individuals lacking a high risk profile."
"9544798","Project Summary The aging population in the United States is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse than ever before. Health disparities have been well documented across diverse older adult populations, including evidence to suggest that there may be increased rates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders among some groups. Researched aimed at understanding, preventing and ameliorating health disparities in AD is a major public health priority. However, to study and address these health disparities requires psychometrically sound and culturally appropriate assessment tools to sensitively measure early clinical signs associated with AD and to provide good outcome measures to track disease progression and response to treatment. The measurement properties of such assessment tools must be conceptually and psychometrically equivalent across diverse populations. With previous NIA funding (Farias, AG 0215111, AG 031252) we developed a novel questionnaire-based assessment tool (the Everyday Cognition scales (ECog) to measure very early limitations in everyday functions. Our work has shown that subtle changes in everyday functions, as measured by the ECog, can be used to identify older adults at increased risk for developing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia. However, our most recent work has shown that the current version of the ECog is less sensitive to predicting disease progression in ethnic/racial minority subgroups (Latinos and African Americans) than it is in non-Latino Caucasians. Such findings provide clear rationale for the need to adapt and further refine this instrument to improve its utility as an early indicator of disease and as an outcome measure among diverse populations. The proposed study will utilize a multi-method (quantitative and qualitative) approach to evaluate and improve the measurement equivalence of the ECog among diverse older adult populations. The aims of this study are twofold. In Aim 1 we will utilize existing data from the University of California, Davis Alzheimer Disease Center's multiethnic longitudinal cohort to quantitatively evaluate which items of the ECog display evidence of poor measurement equivalence across three racial/ethnic groups (African Americans, Latinos, and non-Latino Caucasians) using sophisticated analytic methods. Informed by results of Aim 1, Aim 2 will employ well-established cognitive interviewing methods to further evaluate and identify the reasons why particular ECog items are problematic for specific racial/ethnic groups. For example, some items may not be readily understood as intended and/or some items may not be appropriate the cultural context and lifestyle of some groups. These items will be modified accordingly and a second wave of cognitive interviews will further evaluate item revisions. Completion of this study will provide the critical formative work to improve our ability to measure early changes in everyday function with comparable accuracy and precision across diverse older adult populations."
"9456011","Project Summary/Abstract  Osteocytes serve as the primary mechanosensors in bone, coordinating bone formation and resorption in response to mechanical demands; however, this coordination is lost in metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis, leading to reduced bone mass and increased fracture risk. Most current clinical treatments target inhibition of bone resorption, but osteoporosis is characterized by defects in multicellular coordination, orchestrated by the mechanotransductive osteocytes. The long-term objective of this project is to understand the mechanisms by which osteocytes transduce mechanical signals to regulate skeletal homeostasis, which may lead to therapies that can restore the balance in osteoporotic bone.  Recent studies by the PI demonstrate that the mechanosensitive transcription factors Yes-associated protein (YAP) and Transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) have mutually compensatory roles in skeletal development, but their roles late in the skeletal cell sequence, in the osteocyte, have not been studied. We hypothesize that osteocyte YAP and TAZ are critical for bone adaptation to mechanical loading and that drugs that inhibit YAP/TAZ activity for cancer treatment may affect bone health. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims:  Aim 1 will determine the roles of osteocyte YAP and TAZ in bone adaptation to mechanical loads. These studies will employ the mouse tibial loading model in which dynamic application of mechanical forces induces both cortical and trabecular bone adaptation. By conditional ablation of YAP, TAZ and candidate co-effectors from osteocytes, these studies will reveal, for the first time, the roles of these proteins in osteocyte function. Using a combination of biomechanical, genetic, and molecular biology approaches, we will identify the molecular effectors of YAP/TAZ-mediated mechanotransduction in osteocytes in vivo. Aim 2 will determine whether pharmacological YAP/TAZ inhibition impairs bone adaptation. Pharmaceutical targeting of YAP/TAZ activation shows promise as an anti-cancer therapy; however, cancer treatment-induced osteoporosis is a common side effect of anti-cancer therapies, and may be induced by drugs that inhibit YAP/TAZ activation. Therefore, understanding the influence of these drugs on bone homeostasis and remodeling will be essential for assessing drug safety and efficacy.  Together, these studies will establish a novel mechanotransductive signaling pathway in the osteocyte, and will significantly impact our understanding of osteocyte control of bone formation, homeostasis, and mechanical adaptation, with broad implications for metabolic bone disease and anti-cancer therapy."
"9476964","PROJECT SUMMARY  Ca2+ regulates a range of activities in hepatocytes, from secretion to metabolism to proliferation. This single  second messenger can regulate these different cell functions in part because it is differentially regulated in the  various microdomains within the cell. For example, secretion is regulated by Ca2+ in the apical region of the  cytoplasm, lipid metabolism is regulated by Ca2+ in mitochondria, and liver regeneration is regulated by Ca2+  within the nucleoplasm. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) is the only intracellular Ca2+ release  channel in hepatocytes, and so it is largely responsible for establishing these various microdomains and for the  resulting effects. There are three InsP3R isoforms, only two of which are expressed in hepatocytes under  normal conditions. The type 1 InsP3R (InsP3R-1) accounts for 20% of InsP3Rs in hepatocytes. It is distributed  throughout the cytoplasm and our recent evidence furthermore suggests it preferentially couples ER to  mitochondria and is responsible for mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling. The type 2 InsP3R (InsP3R-2) normally  accounts for 80% of InsP3Rs in hepatocytes. It is concentrated in a specialized ER region beneath the  canalicular membrane and regulates insertion and activation of transporters important for bile secretion. The  type 3 InsP3R (InsP3R-3) normally is present in negligible amounts in hepatocytes, but our preliminary data  suggest that its expression increases dramatically in patients with chronic hepatocellular diseases, such as  alcoholic hepatitis and hepatitis C viral infection. Our preliminary findings further suggest that the subcellular  distribution of InsP3R-3 is distinct from that of InsP3R-1 or 2. Therefore, the hypothesis of this project is that  inflammation increases InsP3R-3 expression in hepatocytes and this is responsible for the impaired liver  regeneration that occurs in chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. We will test this hypothesis through the  following specific aims: (1) Determine the factors that regulate InsP3R-3 expression in hepatocytes. We will  determine the role of specific transcription factors, miRNAs, and gene methylation in InsP3R-3 expression  under normal circumstances and in specific disease states. (2) Identify the factors that determine the patterns  of subcellular targeting of InsP3R-3 in hepatocytes and its effect on Ca2+ signals. We will identify the targeting  signals that determine the subcellular distribution of InsP3R-3 in hepatocytes, and determine the subcellular  regions in which InsP3R-3 increases Ca2+. (3) Determine the effects of InsP3R-3 expression in hepatocytes on  cell proliferation, apoptosis and liver regeneration. We will examine disease conditions in which hepatocyte  InsP3R-3 expression is increased and liver regeneration is impaired, and determine whether and how InsP3R-  3 participates in the impaired liver regeneration. Collectively, these studies will provide new insights about the  basic biological mechanisms by which subcellular processes are regulated and control cell function, while  simultaneously establishing how these subcellular events are important for the pathogenesis of liver disease."
"9474091","This application proposes a Phase II study to determine the safety and efficacy of a ketogenic diet (KD) as a therapy for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). The KD is a very low carbohydrate, high fat diet developed by the Mayo Clinic, that effectively treats refractory epilepsy. Several mechanisms thought to underlie KD efficacy have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including reduction of neuronal hyperexcitability through glutamatergic inhibition, enhancement of mitochondrial metabolism with reduced oxidative stress, and inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR). Each of these has been proposed as a modulator of AD pathological processes such as ?-amyloid aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation. Interest in the KD as a potential treatment or prevention strategy for AD has been furthered by preclinical studies in which rodent AD models treated with ketone-inducing interventions showed less amyloid and/or tau pathology, and improved memory performance. Studies of medium chain triglyceride (MCT) supplements or a short-term KD intervention have reported memory improvement in participants with early AD, an effect moderated by APOE genotype. Challenges to the use of the KD include poor compliance due to its restrictive nature, and possible long term health risks due to high saturated fat and low phytonutrient intake. The modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) has comparable seizure-inhibiting efficacy to the original KD but allows slightly higher carbohydrate consumption to permit increased intake of vegetables and fruits, and emphasizes healthy fats and proteins such as olive oil and fish. In pilot work, we show that a 6 week MMKD improved memory, CSF AD biomarker profiles, mitochondrial function, and brain perfusion in precuneus and posterior cingulate regions. Based on these promising results, the proposed study will examine the effects of a 4-month MMKD compared with an American Heart Association diet in 120 adults with aMCI. We will investigate diet effects on AD biomarkers, on cognition, on neuroimaging measures of metabolism, vascular function and connectivity, and on CSF/blood epigenetic, exosome, and omic markers. Our study will extend previous findings in several important ways by: 1) using a MMKD rather than a traditional KD, which has the potential for greater long-term compliance and health benefits; 2) increasing the duration of the diet intervention and the sample size to be studied; 3) examining potential mechanisms of diet effects that may result in new biomarkers and therapeutic targets; and 4) examining key treatment response variables such as APOE genotype, amyloid positivity and metabolic status that could inform precision medicine approaches to dietary prescription. The proposed study will extend previous work by providing rich data regarding the efficacy, feasibility, safety, and underlying mechanisms associated with MMKD intervention. As such, it will provide important information to guide the design of a future Phase III study and to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets that may enhance precision medicine approaches to diet and AD risk."

"9697463","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Women are more susceptible than men to several aspects of drug addiction, including relapse due to stressful events. Addictive mechanisms require associative memory processes that critically involve hippocampal circuits, including the opioid system. Our light and electron microscopic (EM) studies have revealed notable sex and estrous cycle differences in the hippocampal opioid system: enkephalins, mu opioid receptors (MORs) and delta opioid receptors (DORs) are subcellularly positioned in neurons in the mossy fiber circuitry to enhance excitability and learning processes in females with elevated estrogen states. Moreover, unlike males, females in high estrogen states exhibit a long-term potentiation (LTP) evoked by low frequency stimulation of the mossy fibers that is regulated by DORs. Progress during the last grant period showed that chronic immobilization stress (CIS) in males, which results in CA3 neuron dendritic retraction and parvalbumin interneuron loss, essentially shuts off the hippocampal opioid system. Conversely, CIS in females, regardless of estrogen state, primes the opioid system for greater excitation of CA3 pyramidal cells. Specifically, afte CIS mossy fiber enkephalin levels are elevated and the distribution of MORs and DORs in hippocampal neurons resembles that seen in unstressed females at high estrogen states. Moreover, our EM studies revealed in females, but not males, the involvement of a second mechanism for enhancing hippocampal excitation following CIS: DORs traffic to the near plasmalemma of hilar GABAergic interneurons that are known to project to granule cells dendrites where they converge with entorhinal afferents. Notably one-hour after a single injection of oxycodone (3mg/kg, i.p.) the DORs in these GABAergic interneurons have moved to the plasmalemma where additional exposure to ligand would disinhibit these neurons and thus could promote LTP at entorhinal-granule cell synapses. To date, however, no studies have explored the mechanisms by which chronic stress-induced changes in the opioid system in females could advance associative memory processes important for drug addiction, particularly to oxycodone. Thus, this renewal application proposes to test the central hypothesis that the alterations in the hippocampal opioid system induced by chronic stress predispose females to enhanced sensitivity to oxycodone and promote drug-related associative learning. Aim 1 will first compare the effects of CIS on the acquisition of oxycodone-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in females and males. Second, MORs and DORs will be selectively antagonized at critical hippocampal sites, to determine their role in oxycodone CPP in unstressed and CIS female and male rats. Aim 2 will determine how oxycodone CPP alters specific molecular (as assessed by targeted PCR gene array) and anatomic (as assessed by light and EM immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization) profile of the hippocampal mossy fiber opioid system in female and male rats under basal conditions and after CIS."
"9699981","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed application, submitted in response to CDC RFA-CE-15-001 'Research Grants for Preventing Violence and Violence Related Injury (R01)' seeks to rigorously evaluate structural interventions focused specifically on alcohol policies for the primary prevention of youth violence in US-based children and adolescents. Specifically we focus our study on the relationship between alcohol outlet density (a structural/environmental factor) and changes in the alcohol environment due to alcohol policies (e.g., tax increases and Sunday sales restrictions) on subsequent rates of youth violence in a cross-section of 10 U.S. States that are Alcohol Beverage Control States and have publically available data on youth violence perpetration. We provide a more in-depth analysis in 1 state to examine the mediating role of policy enforcement and changes in overall community disorder/disadvantage. There is a sizable body of literature demonstrating that the alcohol environment impacts community violence and other forms of interpersonal violence among adults, e.g., physical assaults (e.g., Franklin et al., 2010; Gorman et al., 1998; Gorman et al., 2001, Jennings et al., 2014). Far less research has been conducted that specifically examines structural interventions related to the alcohol environment as a means to prevent and reduce youth violence and have predominantly been limited to studies of changing the minimum drinking age in Europe (Toomey and Wagenaar, 1999; Callaghan, et al., 2014; Kypri, et al., 2014). The proposed research provides a unique opportunity to examine the overall impact of alcohol outlets and structural interventions designed to reduce alcohol outlet density and availability on youth violence. We also explore the potential mediating role of overall neighborhood disorder, a known correlate of increased alcohol outlet density. This study will evaluate the impact of alcohol outlet density and structural interventions on violence perpetrated by children and adolescents. To our knowledge, this would provide the first comprehensive evaluation that identifies this relationship among children and adolescents. The Specific Aims of this research are to: Aim 1: Determine the extent to which youth violence co-varies as a function of alcohol outlet density and policies designed to regulate and reduce alcohol outlet density, availability and access in a national sample.

"9530227","Project Summary Recognition of social behavior and cell-cell signaling as a ubiquitous property of bacteria revolutionized our understanding of microbiology and microbial pathogenesis. Parasitic protozoa generally are not considered in this context. Recent work however, demonstrates that the paradigm of microbes as social organisms can and should be brought to bear on questions about parasite biology, transmission and pathogenesis. African trypanosomes, e.g. Trypanosoma brucei, and related trypanosomatid parasites are responsible for substantial human suffering worldwide. T. brucei is transmitted between human hosts by tsetse flies. The parasites live in communities in which they can communicate with one another and engage in group behaviors that are not evident in individual cells, this behavior is termed ?Social Motility? (SoMo) and shows analogies to social behavior in bacteria. Studies of SoMo have generated insight into parasite development, transmission, signaling and chemotaxis. In the current proposal we will use recently developed SoMo mutants and new tools for imaging parasites in mixed populations to determine the role of social behavior and cAMP for infection of tsetse flies, define gene expression programs that govern social behavior and tsetse fly infection, and dissect mechanisms of parasite chemotaxis. We expect our studies will provide new perspectives and approaches for understanding parasite biology, which in turn are necessary to develop novel strategies for management and therapeutic intervention in parasitic disease."
"9499691","PROJECT SUMMARY Diseases that arise from mutations in components of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation can be devastating, as mitochondria are crucial for energy synthesis. These diseases occur predominantly in infants and children, with a prevalence of 1 in 5000. Though virtually any organ can be affected, the heart is frequently involved, because cardiac function has such high energy requirements. These mitochondrial cardiomyopathies have a particularly grim prognosis, with mortality rates increased nearly three-fold compared to children without cardiac involvement. In linking cardiac function to mitochondrial metabolism, calcium signaling may be central to the pathological process. Calcium influx into the mitochondria can potently stimulate ATP synthesis, but excessive levels trigger mitochondrial failure and cell death. We hypothesize that, when oxidative phosphorylation becomes impaired, feedback regulation causes a compensatory increase in calcium influx, boosting ATP synthesis. However, after prolonged entry, mitochondrial calcium levels become excessive and trigger mitochondrial failure, exacerbating cardiac dysfunction. The rationale for this study is to determine whether such regulation exists in a well- characterized animal model of mitochondrial cardiomyopathies, which features genetic deletion of a mitochondrial transcription factor (Tfam) selectively in cardiomyocytes. The first aim is to determine whether the increased mitochondrial calcium levels found in preliminary studies are truly compensatory. For this aim, we will create animals with mitochondrial cardiomyopathies that have mitochondria that either cannot take up calcium, or are resistant to excessive calcium levels. The second objective is to determine the molecular mechanism causing enhanced mitochondrial calcium influx, and determine whether such enhancement can be replicated in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. In these analyses, we use an innovative set of techniques, including direct electrical measurement of mitochondrial calcium currents, that overcome technical challenges present in studying calcium transport. If successful, our research will define a significant new target for potential therapy in these devastating disorders."
"9463494","Project Summary Serotonergic and dopaminergic systems of the brain are broadly implicated in mental illness including depression and mood-related disorders. How these systems interface to modulate affective state in the presence of stress and recovery from stress remains poorly understood. Dopamine neurons located in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and serotonin neurons located in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) share common targets. Both project to the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and amygdala. Each of these regions has been implicated in depression-related symptom domains and the balance of dopamine and serotonin in these regions is an important regulator homeostatic response to stress. Serotonin neurons of the DRN directly synapse onto dopamine neurons of the VTA, indicating a direct interaction between these systems. To establish the role of this circuit connection in behavioral regulation of stress and behavioral domains relevant to depression, we will perform a detailed circuit analysis of serotonergic inputs from the DRN to dopamine neurons of the VTA and how this connectivity changes in response to social defeat stress in susceptible and resistance mice. To enhance the granularity of our circuit analysis, we will measure excitatory and inhibitory coupling between serotonin and dopamine neurons in dopamine cells that project to specific areas of the brain. To ascertain how reward responding of serotonergic neurons change at the local circuit level of the DRN following social defeat in susceptible and resistant mice, we will monitor in vivo calcium dynamics in all serotonin producing neurons of the DRN and exclusively in those cells that synapse onto dopamine neurons. To establish the functional importance of serotonergic DRN input to the VTA in the mitigation of depression-related symptom domains following social defeat, we will selectively enhance the activity of DRN neurons that synapse onto dopamine cells using designer receptor (DREADD) technology. These studies, combined with the efforts of my collaborators in this center grant will provide an unparalleled assessment the neural circuitry underlying susceptibility and resistance to social defeat stress, elucidate the therapeutic potential of an endogenous opioid system and how it interfaces with these circuits, determine the impact of sex-specific differences in these circuits associated with stress-induced alterations in decision making, and provide detailed assessments of transcriptional and translational changes in treatment resistant females suffering from depression and in rodents susceptible to depression-related symptoms."
"9480110","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The menthol receptor TRPM8 is considered the principal cold sensor in mammalian sensory neurons as animals lacking TRPM8 function are deficient in cold and cold pain behaviors. However some residual cold sensitivity remains, indicating the possible presence of TRPM8-independent cold transduction mechanisms. Other cell types, such as those expressing TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels, are critical for somatosensory signaling, and have been implicated in certain aspects of cold sensation. Genetic approaches to determine the role of these channels and cell-types are complicated by the fact that the resulting phenotypes are investigated either many days after manipulation, or in developmentally disparate backgrounds. An elegant approach has recently been devised that targets cell impermeant sodium (Na+) channel blockers to only primary sensory neurons mediating pain (nociceptors). Specifically, when stimulated with agonists for nociceptor-specific TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels, large molecules such as the charged lidocaine derivative QX-314 permeate through these channels, thereby selectively blocking nerve conduction in just these neuronal populations. Previous reports failed to find large molecule entry through TRPM8 channels, suggesting that TRPM8 neurons cannot be targeted in this manner. Our underlying hypothesis, supported by our novel preliminary data, is that large molecules permeate cells through TRPM8 when the channel is activated by potent agonists, and we propose to determine if cold and cold pain can be ameliorated by selectively blocking nerve conduction of these and other neuronal populations. Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms whereby TRPM8 channels permeate large cations in vitro and be used as a means to target Na+-channel blockers to TRPM8 neurons. Aim 2 will determine if targeting Na+-channel blockers in TRPM8 neurons alters cold sensation in mice, and determine if other primary sensory neurons also contribute to cold. Aim 3 will extend these behavioral analyses to determine if chronic cold pain induced by injury can be ameliorated by targeting Na+-channel blockers to TRPM8, TRPV1, or TRPA1 neurons. With these studies we will determine if cold and cold pain can be specifically inhibited by the selective entry of large, cell impermeant anesthetics, as well as use this novel approach to further define the cellular basis for cold and cold pain, including identifying TRPM8-independent neuronal populations that contribute to this somatosensory modality."
"9475800","Pain is the hallmark of vasocclusion (VOC) in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Evidence for a major role for  inflammation in VOC is provided by studies demonstrating proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFo, IL1li,  leucotrienes (LKTs) and lipid peroxidation products (which are all elevated in SCD) sensitize nociceptors and  act as agonists for the TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels which play a role in neural and non neural pain. In  children with SCD, an increase in thermal pain sensitivity suggests a further link between nociceptor  sensitization and inflammation , with evidence that n-3 PUFA supplementation with Docosahexanoic and  Eicosapentanoic acids (DHA and EPA) decrease VOC episodes. However, no systematic analyses of pro  and anti-inflammatory biomarkers has been conducted. In addition, DHA and EPA via their lipoxygenase  products (Resolvins of D and E series) are potent inhibitors of inflammation and inhibit the TRPV1 and  TRPA1 channels. We will conduct a dose escalation Phase l/ll Safety/Efficacy Trial of DHA/EPA (25 and  45mg/kgm) for 6 months in children 9 to 19 years with HbSS and HbS?Thal°. We will add new perspectives  to the previous Trials conducted in Nigeria and Sudan. Namely (i) evaluate safety of low and a moderately  high dosage, (ii) check periodically for Trial compliance by assays of whole blood DHA/EPA, (iii) evaluate  effects of n-3 PUFAs on proinflammatory (hsCRP, TNFa, ILIIi, LKTs and lipid peroxidation products) and  anti-inflammatory markers (Resolvins RvDI and E1), (iv) test for modulation of thermal pain sensitivity by  quantitative sensory testing (to link pain and pain-related eicosanoids and cytokines), (v) assess QoL  parameters as a relevant summation of DHA and EPA effects. In an additional Aim, we will assess  biobanked plasmas for select biomarkers from a previous longitudinal study of 100 young children with SCD  whose pain experiences had been rigorously characterized. Novel statistical modeling approaches will  retrospectively identify classes of children based on joint inflammatory biomarker and pain frequency  profiles, identifying surrogate markers of pain in SCD. These 2 Aims should set the stage for a future Phase  III Trial of n-3 PUFAs in modulating pain and inflammation in SCD."
"9470805","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common cancer in AIDS patients associated with infection by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). KS is often involved with oral cavity, and oral KSHV infection is necessary for the development of oral KS and virus spread. Despite antiretroviral therapy, KS remains common among HIV-infected patients. Existing antiviral and anticancer therapies are ineffective for eliminating persistent KSHV infection and for treating KSHV-induced cancer. Because KSHV latent infection is necessary for its long-term persistent infection and for KS development, identificatio of factors essential for KSHV latent infection can lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for oral KSHV persistent infection and malignancies. We have developed three novel systems to address these challenges: 1) KSHV-induced cellular transformation of primary human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), 2) KSHV persistent infection in the oral cavity in NOD/SCID IL2R?-/- (NSG) humanized mice, and 3) KSHV persistent infection in primary human oral epithelial cells, gingiva MSCs and dental pulp MSCs. Using these models, we have found extensive epigenetic reprograming of cellular chromatins and gene expression networks in latent KSHV- infected cells. Furthermore, we have identified histone modifiers including polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) proteins and class III histone deacetylases sirtuins as the critical factors for the survival of latent KSHV-infected cells. Significantly, targeting PRC2 proteins and sirtuins induce massive cell death of latent KSHV-infected cells including KSHV-transformed cells but have minimal cytotoxicity to uninfected cells. Based on these results, our hypothesis is that histone modifiers mediate the survival of latent KSHV-infected oral cells, and therefore inhibition of these targets can kill latent KSHV-infected cells resulting in effective therapeutic intervention for oral KSHV persistent infection and KSHV-induced cancer. We propose to identify the histone modifiers essential for KSHV latent infection in oral cells (Aim 1); delineate the mechanisms by which histone modifiers mediate the survival of latent KSHV infected oral cells (Aim 2); and therapeutically clear oral KSHV persistent infection and inhibit KSHV-induced oral cancer in animal models by targeting specific histone modifiers (Aim 3). The proposed project is significant because it will delineate the essential histone modifiers for oral KSHV persistent infection and pathogenesis, and identify effective inhibitors for therapeutic inhibition of these novel targets. The results will provide insights int the mechanisms of oral KSHV persistent infection and KSHV-induced oncogenesis. The outcomes can also be applied to other oral persistent viral infections and virus-induced cancer."
"9474555","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am a gerontologist physician-scientist, with a Master's degree in Clinical Research Methods and training in Endocrinology, focused on the discovery of genomic mechanisms that protect against age-associated diseases. I completed two years of post-doctoral training in translational gerontology and genetics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Einstein) Institute for Aging Research, under the mentorship of Nir Barzilai, MD, during which time I was funded by the T32 and AFAR grants. Subsequently, I joined the Einstein faculty and was recognized with the Glenn Award for Research in Biological Mechanisms of Aging. I am presently funded by a career development KL2 grant from Einstein. My proposed project will be carried out within the  environment of two established studies currently conducted at Einstein: (1) Longevity Genes  Project (LGP), a cross sectional study of centenarians and unrelated controls, which serves as  the discovery cohort for the genomic elements and phenotypes that are subsequently evaluated  in (2) LonGenity, an independent, longitudinal validation study of offspring of centenarians, who  are enriched with longevity genomes, and age-matched controls without parental history of  longevity. The overarching hypothesis of these studies is that unique genomic elements protect against age-related diseases and result in healthy longevity, which is supported by observational and genetic evidence. My mentoring committee is headed by Dr. Barzilai, who directs the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Biology of Aging, the Glenn Center for the Biology of Human Aging, and leads the longevity studies at Einstein. During the award period I will advance my knowledge in the longitudinal study methods, genetics and aging, as well as enhance my leadership skills, through mentored research and didactic training. Expanding evidence suggests that genomic alterations, which result in the attenuation of the growth hormone/ insulin-like growth factor-1 (GH/IGF-1) signaling, result in extended survival and improved health in animal models and humans. My study proposal hypothesizes that longevity- related genomic factors regulate the GH/IGF-1 phenotypes, which in turn, mediate protection against age-related diseases and promote longevity. This hypothesis will be tested prospectively in the LonGenity cohort and will determine the effects of the longevity genomic elements on the GH/IGF-1 phenotypes, in addition to, the prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dementia, frailty, and exceptional longevity. Genomic elements to be tested will include longevity genotypes and microRNAs discovered in LGP by a candidate gene approach, unbiased genome-wide association study approach, and microRNA screening approach. The results of my early work investigating the effect of the GH/IGF-1 phenotype in nonagenarians have recently been published in Aging Cell and received international media coverage. This proposed project presents an opportunity to make discoveries that may lead to drug development for healthy aging, while providing a fertile environment within which I will grow into an independent gerontology investigator and a leader in translational research focusing on genomic regulation of endocrine pathways in aging."

"9507167","Microbial population genetic research has been crucial for understanding pathogen dynamics, virulence, host specificity, and many other topics; in many cases uncovering unexpected and transformative biological processes. However, conventional population genetic analyses are limited by the quantity of sequence data from each sample. The temporal, spatial, and evolutionary resolution of techniques that rely on single gene sequences or multi-locus sequence typing are often insufficient to study biological processes on fine scales, precisely the scales at which many evolutionary and mechanistic process occur. Population genomics offers a vast quantity of sequence information for inferring evolutionary and ecological processes on very fine spatial and temporal scales, inferences that are critical to understanding and eventually controlling many infectious diseases. The promise of population genomics is tempered, however, by difficulties in isolating and preparing microbes for next-generation sequencing. We have developed the selective whole genome amplification (SWGA) technology to sequence microbial genomes from complex biological specimens without relying on labor-intensive laboratory culture, even if the focal microbial genome constitutes only a miniscule fraction of the natural sample. The primary hindrance to popular adoption of SWGA for microbial genomic studies is not its effectiveness in producing samples suitable for next-generation sequencing but in the upfront investment needed to develop an effective protocol to amplify the genome of a specific microbial species. Identifying an SWGA protocol that consistently results in selective and even amplification across the target genome is currently hindered by computationally-inefficient software that can evaluate a very limited set of the potentially effective solutions. Further, this software uses marginally-effective optimality criteria as there is currently only a limited understanding of the true criteria that result in highly-selective and even amplification of a target genome. As a result, SWGA protocol development is currently costly in both time and resources. A primary goal of the proposed research is to identify the criteria that result in optimal SWGA by analyzing next- generation sequencing data with advanced machine learning techniques. These optimality criteria will be integrated into a freely-available, computationally-efficient swga development program that will reduce the upfront investment in SWGA protocol development, thus allowing researchers to address medically- and biologically-important questions in any microbial species. In the near term, this project will also generate effective SWGA protocols for four microbial species which can be used immediately to address fundamental questions in evolutionary biology, disease progression, and emerging infectious disease dynamics. From a global disease perspective, this work is imperative as the majority of microbial species cannot easily be cultured and are in danger of becoming bystanders in the genomics revolution that is currently elucidating evolutionary processes and molecular mechanisms in cultivable microbial species."
"9484145","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood sets that stage for self-regulatory and decision making processes that shape health and well-being for a lifetime. Research is rapidly uncovering the fundamental principles and processes which govern how human beings perceive the environment, process information, make decisions, experience, express and regulate emotion, form and change attitudes, beliefs and values, and become and remain motivated to change behavior. Translation of these basic behavioral science findings to applied health problems and scalable interventions that improve health and well-being during the childhood years is a complex challenge. Achieving this goal requires knowledge in three critical domains: trajectories of child development and behavior and their biological underpinnings, parenting as a transactional process with roots in biology, and behavioral intervention implementation. We propose a training program that will supply a cadre of researchers fluent in the integration of these three domains of knowledge. We propose to support 4 post-doctoral fellows per year (2 MD fellows in Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics and 2 PhD psychologists). Each fellow will participate in a 2-year course of training that will provide them with knowledge and skills in (1) theories of development and behavior; (2) developmental science methodologies (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging, functional near infrared spectroscopy, eye-tracking, and observational behavioral methodologies); (3) study design and statistical methodology; (4) translation of behavioral research findings to intervention; (5) presentation skills; (6) critical assessment of the scientific literature; (7) socialization into the profession by seeking consultation and advice; (8) grant preparation and peer review; (9) career planning; and (10) ethical conduct of research. The training program will be based in the Department of Pediatrics in collaboration with the Center for Human Growth and Development (CHGD), an interdisciplinary research unit of the University of Michigan with a 50- year history of robust federal funding. CHGD includes 38 regular faculty members, all of whom hold joint appointments in academic departments, including Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, Pediatric Endocrinology, Public Health (Health Behavior and Health Education, Environmental Health Sciences, and Epidemiology), Psychiatry, Social Work, Linguistics, Neurology, Psychology, Neonatology, and Obstetrics and Gynecology. Eighteen faculty with robust funding and mentoring histories are included in the current application. The training will draw on the rich resources at the University of Michigan, including the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program didactic series, the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research, and the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research Summer Program in Quantitative Methods of Social Research. In summary, our training program will prepare leaders in the field of child development. They will be poised to make substantial contributions to improving health and well-being in childhood by integrating biology, behavior, and intervention science."
"9390338","Abstract There has been a revolution in biomedicine fueled by the development of next generation sequencing technologies. These advances have made it possible to address systems level questions. Instead of determining the effect of a perturbation on one gene, all genes can be assessed simultaneously. Instead of asking how a transcription factor binds to a single promoter or enhancer, now all binding sites for that factor can be determined in a single experiment. Taking advantage of these approaches involves the application of specialized technical and analytical skills, and may be beyond the reach of a single laboratory. Mindful of these issues, and of the need to apply cutting edge genome-wide technology to questions of relevance to diabetes, obesity, and metabolic disease, we have established a Functional Genomics and Bioinformatics Core. The goals of this Core are to provide access to state-of-the-art methods to members of the BNORC community, in order to enhance and facilitate a deeper understanding of how metabolic disease develops, and how it can be diagnosed and treated."
"9648210","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tooth movement derived by PDL Cellular Manipulations The ability of teeth to move is essential for their adaptation to the constantly changing environment and therefore for their survival. The periodontal ligament (PDL) has a central role in controlling this tooth movement. However, despite the fundamental role of the PDL, the functional mechanisms and the 3D structure of this remarkable tissue are not fully understood. The proposed study is aimed at elucidating the structure-function basis of the PDL and by doing so to generate a new clinical method for controlled tooth movement. Loads change the fibrous distribution inside the PDL in order to enable certain functions. For instance, orthodontic loads cause changes in PDL fiber structure and trigger a cascade of bone remodeling that eventually leads to a change in the position of the tooth. It was recently shown that the PDL is not uniform in its structure and function even under normal functional loads; in other words, tooth function controls the structure of the PDL. The hypothesis of this proposed project is that intentional modifications in the PDL structure will trigger changes in the surrounding bone and eventually functional tooth changes. This hypothesis will be addressed in four complementary specific aims. The mentored phase (K99) will be conducted with Dr. Bjorn Olsen as mentor and Dr. Leslie Will as a co-mentor, at Harvard School of Dental Medicine and at Boston University School of Dental Medicine. The experiments in this phase are anticipated to establish a 3D characterization of the collagen networks and the cellular populations of the mouse molar tooth PDL. To do so, we will utilize an arsenal of 3D imaging methods, we will use a unique custom-made apparatus inside a microCT as well as 2 photon and 2nd harmonic-generation imaging. For high resolution structural analysis we will also employ STORM and AirSEM methods. We will cross different genetically modified mouse strains to investigate the cellular populations in the PDL and we will take advantage of in-situ hybridization to investigate gene expression levels as well as signaling pathways. Crossing disciplines, bioengineering tools will be used for in- vitro investigation of the PDL stiffness and how to alter it. The R00 phase wil establish a deep understanding of the association between structure and function of the PDL and will develop a mechanism to control PDL function by structural modifications. This project includes a well-structured training program that provides theoretical course work, practical experience and protected research time during individualized specialty training in Orthodontics. The final result of this project, controlling tooth movement through modifications of cellular activities inside the PDL, will be a novel approach with the potential of greatly advancing the discipline of orthodontics and benefiting other medical disciplines as well."
"9425712","PROJECT SUMMARY Monocytes are innate immune cells with diverse functions in host defense against infection and tumors, as well as tissue homeostasis, repair and regeneration. Monocytes perform surveillance roles in tissues throughout the body, and are stored in the bone marrow for rapid recruitment to infected or injured tissues. Two major classes of functionally distinct monocytes are found in the bone marrow, blood and spleen: classical (Ly6Chi in mice) and non-classical (Ly6C?) monocytes. However, additional functionally diverse monocyte subsets have recently been reported to be produced in the steady-state and under stress conditions such as infection. The molecular mechanisms underlying production of these subsets by bone marrow progenitors are poorly defined. Our studies have challenged the current, widely-accepted model of myelopoiesis and revealed 2 independent pathways of classical Ly6Chi monocyte production in the bone marrow: via granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) and monocyte-DC progenitors (MDPs). We found that GMP- and MDP-derived Ly6Chi monocytes are morphologically distinct and exhibit differences in gene expression that are defined by their origins. GMP- derived Ly6Chi monocytes are larger and more granular than MDP-derived Ly6Chi monocytes, and enriched for granule proteins including myeloperoxidase. Thus GMP- and MDP-derived Ly6Chi monocytes appear to be functionally distinct. Moreover, we discovered that the two pathways of monocyte production are mobilized independently in response to microbial stimuli. For example, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration increases neutrophil and monocyte production by GMPs, while CpG DNA promotes monocyte and DC production by MDPs. Thus, the existence of two independent pathways of monocyte differentiation permits production of specific combinations of myeloid cell types during the emergency myelopoiesis response to pathogens. Our objective is to define pathways and mechanisms of monocyte production by GMPs and MDPs in the steady-state and in response to infection. In Aim 1, we will determine how myeloid transcription factors and epigenetic modifications shape the functional programming of Ly6Chi monocytes produced via the GMP and MDP pathways. In Aim 2, we will define the potential of GMP- and MDP-derived Ly6Chi monocytes to give rise to inflammatory macrophages and monocyte-derived DCs. In Aim 3, we will determine how LPS and CpG selectively target GMPs and MDPs to shape the repertoire of myeloid subsets produced. We have assembled a team of immunologists, hematologists and computational biologists to perform a set of experiments that will provide important insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the production of functionally diverse monocytes in the steady-state and under stress conditions. Moreover, our studies will lay the groundwork for the development of new translational approaches to specifically target functionally distinct monocyte subsets, which could be employed to promote immunity against pathogens or tumors, suppress inflammatory pathology, or facilitate tissue repair."
"9456053","PROJECT SUMMARY  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex multi-system autoimmune disease characterized by the loss of tolerance to self-antigens and subsequent production of self-reactive antibodies. The most well-known and clinically-tested class of antibodies are the anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), which include concurrent antibodies against a large family of ribonucleoproteins (anti-RNPs) such as the smith proteins (anti-Sm). We considered a possible cross-reactivity of the antibodies against shared antigen epitopes among the RNPs. Specifically, we noted a common type of posttranslational modification (PTM) known as symmetrical dimethylarginine (SDMA) prominently associated with these RNP molecules. To investigate whether these SDMA modifications contribute to PTM-promoted neoantigenic epitopes, we synthesized a large panel of test antigens from 76 proteins that carry SDMA marks. From probing 31 SLE patients, we detected strong antibody reactivity in about half of the patients towards SDMA-modified sequences, as opposed to the native epitopes with the same sequences. Meanwhile, selectivity for SDMA epitopes were not seen in heterogeneous healthy controls. The purpose of this ongoing study is to elucidate the potential involvement of arginine methylation in neoantigenic responses in lupus patients. The proposed study will comprehensively address the breadth of SDMA modifications in SLE autoantibody responses. Furthermore, we will use ex vivo and in vivo tools to determine the molecular mechanisms for anti-SDMA-mediated immune complexes. The working model that has its emphasis on chemically modified epitopes represents an important conceptual advancement in understanding autoimmune mechanisms. The positive outcomes of the study will also provide the molecular basis for the design of next-generation SLE tests with the incorporation of SDMA to the epitope residues."

"9455026","Antibiotic resistance is compromising our ability to treat bacterial infections. Clinical microbiology laboratories guide appropriate treatment through antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of patient bacterial isolates. However, increasingly, pathogens are developing resistance to a broad range of antimicrobials, requiring AST of less commonly used or recently introduced agents for which no commercially available or FDA-cleared testing methods exist. Agar and broth dilution are gold standard methods for AST that can be used to test any antimicrobial; however, labor and technical complexity precludes their use in hospital-based clinical laboratories. Therefore, bacterial isolates often must be sent to a reference laboratory with a 4-6 day delay in results. Furthermore, even standard methods require overnight incubation prior to readout. Therefore, there exists a significant AST testing gap in which current methodologies cannot adequately address the need for rapid results in the face of unpredictable susceptibility profiles. Our laboratory has recently verified inkjet printer-based digital dispensing technology as a novel platform to facilely perform reference AST for any antimicrobial at will. In this proposal, we aim to combine this methodology with advanced microscopy to leapfrog traditional AST capabilities through: (1) development of a method for microscopic imaging of bacterial replication on a solid-phase, 384-well microplate AST format, thereby allowing determination of susceptibility for any drug at will in 4 hours and (2) development and application of advanced image analysis for automated susceptibility calls. This new platform is designated MAST for microscopy-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The clinical diagnostic performance of the platform will be optimized against an AST reference method for accuracy and precision using a large panel of well-characterized clinical isolates. We anticipate establishing a prototype platform that will address the AST testing gap and thereby help our health system more effectively address the antimicrobial resistance threat."
"9464773","Project Summary  Cancer, the uncontrolled division of abnormal cells, is the second leading cause of death in the United States, taking the lives of nearly 600,000 Americans in 2015. 90% of cancer deaths are due to metastasis, a process which involves cancer cells entering into the blood, squeezing through capillaries, and exiting and colonizing distal organs. Understanding the mechanisms underpinning metastasis, including the mechanical forces cells experience, holds great promise for the rational development of cancer therapeutics, and genomic, transcriptional, and proteomic drivers of metastatic spread have been the topic of intensive study. Recent work has demonstrated that the mechanical stress experienced by cancer cells as they migrate through spatial constrictions is sufficient to induce nuclear envelope disruption, and that this rupture leads to double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). Separate work has established a causal link between nuclear envelope rupture and large scale genomic rearrangements in micronuclei, but whether mechanically-induced DSBs can cause heritable mutations in the genome and contribute to cancer progression is still unknown. Additionally, shear stresses and physical forces experienced by a cell during metastasis are capable of modulating their phenotype in vitro, hinting at mechanosensitive, and potentially druggable, signaling networks in cancer cells.  With this grant, I propose to test whether the mechanical forces encountered by a cancer cell during metastasis induce DNA damage that leads to heritable genomic alterations, assess the impact of these forces on cellular expression profiles and phenotypes, and then identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention in responsive signaling networks. Aim 1 proposes to identify and quantify the DNA damage incurred by cancer cells during mechanical stress. Nuclear envelope disruption and subsequent DNA damage will be measured using live-cell imaging, immunofluorescence microscopy of markers of DNA damage, and single cell gel electrophoresis in several mechanical stress models. Aim 2 will determine the functional significance of mechanical DNA damage and identify affected genomic loci using in vitro models of proliferation, invasiveness, and drug sensitivity, as well as murine models of tumorigenesis and metastatic potential. Aim 3 will dissect the potential transcriptional and proteomic drivers of the phenotypic differences of mechanically stressed cells from the parental population. RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses will be performed to determine the force-dependent transcriptomic and proteomic changes mediating these functional differences. Finally, gene knock-down and overexpression studies will be used to dissect the potential therapeutic benefit of targeting signaling networks mediating response to mechanical stress. By working at the interface of bioengineering, bioinformatics, and cancer genetics, this proposal will help elucidate the role that mechanical forces play in cancer growth and metastasis."
"9551775","Project Summary Sepsis with its complications is a major challenge in contemporary medicine. Approximately 250,000 cases of sepsis lead to fatalities in the USA annually at huge costs for the healthcare system. Depending on the standards of medical care, the worldwide mortality rates in septic humans range from 30% to 70% with an aggregate mortality rate of ~50%. NLRP3 is a key component of the macromolecular signaling complex called the inflammasome that promotes caspase 1-dependent production of IL-1? pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the development of sepsis. Although the factors leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation have been extensively studied, the mechanisms for negatively regulating the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and thus, controlling sepsis, are not known. We found that NLRP3 is inhibited by ubiquitination by Cbl-b, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The significance of this finding is demonstrated by the observation that that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) induces a significant mortality in Cblb-/- mice compared to wild-type (WT) controls, and this increased mortality in Cblb-/- mice induced by LPS is blocked by an IL-1 receptor antagonist or by introducing NLRP3 deficiency. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that during sepsis, Cbl-b is autoubiquitinated/activated and ubiquitinates NLRP3, which in turn inhibits NLRP3 and attenuates NLRP3-mediated innate responses. We propose to determine 1) how Cbl-b regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation; 2) whether and how Cbl-b controls non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome in vivo using CLP-induced sepsis and LPS-induced septic shock as the study models. Understanding the role of Cbl-b in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated signaling pathway will provide novel insights and therapeutic strategies to combat sepsis."
"9534883","ABSTRACT  Antimicrobial resistance is now recognized by world leaders, including the US Congress (and at least one recent President) as one of the most serious public health threats to mankind. Our proposal focuses on Enterococcus faecium (Efm), an extremely resistant, hospital-associated (HA) Gram-positive coccus that now accounts for almost 40% of nosocomial enterococcal infections, some of which are medically untreatable. >80% of clinical Efm isolates are vancomycin resistant (VRE) and almost all of these are ampicillin resistant (Amp-R), the traditional drugs of choice; resistance to newer agents (linezolid, daptomycin) is well documented and increasingly reported.  We now know that most clinical Efm isolates belong to a distinct Efm clade (the HA clade A1) that is thousands of years separated from the community-associated (CA) clade B (comprised mostly of human commensals). A medically very important phenotypic difference is that CA human commensals (clade B) are readily inhibited by Amp (MICs 0.125-2 mg/L), while HA isolates are Amp-R (MICs often >64 mg/L). PBP5 of Efm is a low-affinity penicillin- binding protein (PBP) that is essential for Amp R; it comes in two main forms referred to as PBP5-S (CA clade B, Amp-S strains) and PBP5-R (HA clade A1, Amp-R strains); PBP5-S/R appears to be a transitional form found in clade A2 (animal clade) that is closely related to clade A1. pbp5-R and pbp5-S alleles differ by ~ 5% and there is a consensus of 20-21 amino acids (aa) (some PBP5-Rs have an extra aa) that can distinguish -S from -R proteins; using a multi-copy plasmid, engineered changes of 4 aa, most near the predicted active site, significantly lowered affinity of the corresponding recombinant PBP5 for [14C]penicillin and increased Amp MICs. However, studies of naturally occurring alleles or of mutated genes in the native chromosomal pbp5 site have not been reported.  PBPs are well known targets for antibiotics and are generally amenable to structural studies. Our long-term overarching goal is to use PBP5 structure:function relationships to develop therapeutics against Efm, including VRE. Here, we propose to provide the background for future drug design that would target Amp-R Efm. 1). We will use X- ray crystallography to determine the high-resolution structures of various PBP5-S, PBP5-R and intermediate PBP5- S/R proteins that impact function, such as ?-lactam MICs (after cloning pbp5 alleles into the native pbp5 site of a ?pbp5 HA Efm), and affinity of recPBP5 proteins encoded by the alleles for ?-lactams. A comparison of high- resolution structures of PBP5 forms plus co-crystallization with ?-lactams +/- peptidoglycan components, functional assays and specific site-directed pbp5 mutations, should provide the foundation for understanding the role of specific aa changes seen in nature on affinity of PBP5 forms for ?-lactams and provide insights into how to inhibit this PBP's function. Future projects (e.g., an R33) would then use these structures to rationally design or improve the efficacy of inhibitors of PBP5 forms that confer Amp-R to develop an effective anti-Efm therapy. 2). We will test our hypothesis that Psr of clade B Efm, but not the truncated Psr found in clade A1, results in repression of PBP5 expression, preventing Amp-R even in the presence of pbp5-R, with a possible future goal of designing Psr mimickers."
"9482364","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal application of a training grant currently in its 35th year of funding. The overall goal of this proposal is to train postdoctoral M.D. and Ph.D. fellows for academic careers in investigational dermatology. Its first objective is to provide laboratory training for dermatology-trained physicians. Its second objective is to train Ph.D. basic scientists in laboratory-based translational investigative dermatology. Its third objective is to train M.D. dermatologists and Ph.D.s in clinical and translational research. Trainees will commit to a minimum of two years of research training, which will occur under the supervision of one of sixteen primary preceptors. Laboratory-based fellows (M.D. and Ph.D.) will learn to formulate hypotheses and to design, perform, and analyze experiments, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach that emphasizes the use of human skin tissue as an experimental system. M.D. trainees in clinical/translational research will acquire proficiency in hypothesis-driven clinical research design and methods and in statistical analysis of data, while gaining an appreciation of the basic science knowledge underlying their clinical observations and interventions. To maximize multidisciplinary training, and to broaden our outreach into the broader University community, we have added highly qualified primary preceptors from outside the Department of Dermatology. In addition to mandatory participation in selected departmental didactic activities, introductory and advanced courses in clinical research methods and a molecular biology course for clinician-scientists will be available for trainees through the Medical School and the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (MICHR). Also, face-to- face training in the responsible conduct of research will be provided at the departmental and University-wide levels. In order to attract more dermatologists into academic careers, we have incorporated research fellowship opportunities in cutaneous oncology and dermatopathology, and expanded our traditional clinical research base in skin pharmacology to encompass a wider spectrum of interventions, notably ultraviolet light and appearance-based interventions. We have also changed our resident selection procedure in order to identify and attract NRSA-eligible M.D.s with strong research potential, with excellent results. We have also added a MICHR-sponsored Translational Research Training Program for Ph.D.s. Finally, we have created a Web site for dissemination of detailed information about our program to all potential trainees. By training M.D.s and Ph.D.s in state-of-the-art dermatological research at both the basic and clinical- translational levels, we will maximize the clinical impact of research, enhance the abilities of our trainees to teach future physicians, and increase the basic knowledge upon which our specialty increasingly depends."
"9694342","Over 500,000 worldwide cases of head and neck (H&N) cancer occur annually. Despite aggressive treatment, about 40% of H&N cancers recur and progress. Recent studies of interstitial PDT (I-PDT) have shown promising results in the treatment of patients with locally advanced H&N cancer that fail standard therapies. I-PDT provides a means to treat cancerous tumors while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues and does not exhibit cumulative cell toxicities, distinguishing it from radiation therapy. However, the recent I-PDT studies do not use pre-treatment planning nor treatment monitoring with real time light dosimetry to guide the therapy. As compared to radiation therapy, treatment planning and monitoring for I- PDT remain rudimentary since patient- and tumor-specific photokinetics factors such as tumor oxygenation, photosensitizer (PS) levels and singlet oxygen dose that are critical to the delivery of effective treatment doses are not taken into account. The development of treatment planning and monitoring tools that take into account these factors will fill an unmet clinical need and provide for individualized patient treatment. An effective I-PDT treatment planning and monitoring system is expected to improve therapeutic outcomes, reduce the need for repeat I-PDT or additional cell-killing therapy, and could therefore reduce overall costs in the per patient delivery of cancer-related therapy and care. This SBIR Phase I proposal will be done by Simphotek, Inc. with a subcontract to Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI). The major objective is to develop new prototype software and hardware tools to enable interstitial Intensity-Modulated Photodynamic Therapy (i-IMPDT). The new tools will combine simulations of PS photokinetics with light propagation using fast finite element (FE) analysis techniques that include light scattering and absorption. In the future, these tools will create a platform to provide real time treatment guidance and dose modifications during I-PDT. Simphotek is a world leader in developing sophisticated photokinetics software and RPCI is a world leader in the fields of I-PDT and FE analysis of H&N cancers. This Phase I SBIR has three major aims. Aim 1 is to develop and confirm the accuracy of new customized FE software code and hardware tools to calculate the light dose for I-PDT. To determine simulation accuracy, calculations using the new tools will be compared to phantom measurements done at RPCI mimicking the anatomy of H&N cancer patients. Aim 2 is to adapt Simphotek's photokinetics code to calculate PS fluorescence, PS photobleaching, PS concentration and singlet oxygen dose. Aim 3 is to determine the feasibility of combining the new FE code and the modified photokinetics software code into a unified platform code. After initial development in Phase I, the prototype treatment planning and monitoring tools will be further advanced in Phase II. Clinical trials will be performed in Phase III to determine if the platform code and hardware provides I-PDT physicians and researchers with accurate light dose distributions in cancer tumors and improves patient outcomes."
"9521834","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The world's population is aging and the resulting prevalence of chronic illnesses is a challenge that our society must address. Our vision is to address this challenge by designing a curriculum for undergraduates in MSTEM fields that provides them the needed research skills to address this looming problem. Undergraduates in nursing, psychology, sociology, computer science, engineering (MSTEM) programs as well as those in healthcare-related disciplines need a strong multi-disciplinary background to be truly prepared for research in applying technology to gerontology issues.  The objective of this project is to develop training programs for undergraduate participants in the fields of gerontology, and technology-based assistive environments. This will be done through course work, summer research programs, internships in the field, and professional workshops to help other institutions develop similar programs. The ultimate goal is to bring up a generation of new graduate student researchers and innovators who understand the need of continued work in the field for addressing the aging population issues and begin their research careers prepared for gerontechnology oriented research.  We hypothesize that by developing a these new programs for training both undergraduates and fellow educators in the issues surrounding the aging problem, multi-disciplinary MSTEM approaches to tackling these tough issues, and supporting undergraduates in becoming prepared for graduate programs we can provide gerontechnology-related research groups across the nation with highly qualified applicants.  The rationale of the proposed work is that there are few well integrated MSTEM programs for undergraduates and a lack of training in related research programs for new undergraduates available. Our group's research centers on this field, and our research team is interested in developing generations of qualified graduate students who come prepared for this highly complex field of research.  To accomplish this, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: (1) Develop an undergraduate two semester (one academic year) multi-disciplinary MSTEM Gerontechnology course series, (2) Establish a summer research and internship experience program for highly qualified undergraduates, (3) Support senior capstone projects in MSTEM fields, especially for those students who wish to continue their work from the Gerontechnology course, (4) Integrate the Gerontechnology course into the existing Minor in Aging offered at the institution, giving it its first technology related course. We will also create a certificate of accomplishment for all students who have completed the Gerontechnology course and who have completed additional field experience related to gerontology, and (5) Lead and run two workshops for others interested in learning about the latest research in the field, plus training for other educators in the field of Gerontechnology so they can bring similar programs online at their institutions.  The proposed work is innovative because Gerontechnology related undergraduate programs with a true multi-disciplinary core are rare. The combination of serving both the local student body, summer students from other programs, and to also bring our faculty's experience to other institutions through workshops is a compelling and energetic approach to bolstering the quantity of highly prepared upcoming graduate researchers.  The project is significant because it will introduce many undergraduates to the issues faced by our society in the coming decades, as well as prepare many of them to help develop new approaches to health care through melding technology with traditional medical approaches."
"9481220","OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION - Project Summary/Abstract Early Indicators, Intergenerational Processes, and Aging This program project is a competitive continuation of Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death. Since its inception in 1991, EI has made many discoveries about the longitudinal determinants of retirement and of chronic disease and death at older ages by studying aging processes among Union Army veterans of the US Civil War, a group that mostly reached age 65 between 1885 and 1912. Among these discoveries are  health at older ages, particularly for African-Americans, was worse than previously thought;  retirement responsiveness to income transfers was greater than expected;  social networks affected not just behavior but also health; and,  stressful events in early life and at young adult ages reduced longevity, but extreme stress after age 30 left  a more robust population. These discoveries were possible because of the creation of longitudinal data sets that follow more than 67,000 Union Army recruits from military service back to childhood and forward to death and contain about 15,000 observations per person. This competitive continuation will take the next step by examining the inter- generational determinants of later longevity and socioeconomic status. The overarching purpose of this continuation is to gain a more precise understanding of 1) how inter- generational processes affect aging and longevity and 2) the mechanisms through which parents transmit socioeconomic status and longevity to their children. Data collected for this continuation will support the research aims outlined in this proposal and will also be made publicly available. We propose two cores and three new scientific projects, which will create intergenerational databases from Early Indicators data: Project #1: Intergenerational Processes and Aging of White Americans Project #2: Intergenerational Processes and Aging of African-Americans Project #3: Intergenerational Processes and Aging in Multiple Generations Core A (Administrative) and B (Data Development) will support data collection, research, and dissemination."
"9636280","Project Summary:  Stem cells continuously replenish tissues and organs over the lifetime of an organism through their special capacity for self-renewal and differentiation. The prolonged life span of stem cell clones results in the accumulation of cellular and molecular damage. The resulting functional changes to stem cells over time underlie many age-related problems. For example, age-dependent decline in B- and T-cell production originates at the stem cell level and is responsible for immune problems among the elderly. In addition, leukemia in children predominantly involves lymphoid lineages, while leukemia in the elderly is largely myeloid in origin. This difference correlates with age-dependent changes in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation from lymphoid bias to myeloid bias at the population level.  It has recently become clear that individual HSCs do not age at the same rate. Studies from my lab and others suggest that equally aged HSCs exhibit different levels of myeloid bias within a single organism. The clonal expansion of individual HSCs can also vary so widely that a few HSC clones are found to supply the entire blood pool of elderly individuals. These observations indicate that individual stem cells of the same calendar age within the same organism acquire different aging phenotypes. The proposed research aims to determine the mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of HSC aging phenotypes.  We have developed a suite of cutting-edge tools to address this question at the single cell level. We have collected preliminary data suggesting that the distinct aging phenotypes of individual HSCs are regulated at the clonal level. In the proposed research, we will investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the heterogeneous aging phenotypes of individual HSCs. Our research may identify new aging regulatory factors that are undetectable at the population level.  Completion of our proposed research will provide many immediate clinical benefits. Our findings will advance the understanding of the pathogenesis of many age-related blood and immune diseases, including bone marrow failure, myeloproliferative disorders, and myelodysplastic syndromes. We may also identify new regulatory genes that improve current therapy or develop new classes of therapies to treat these diseases. Our ultimate goal is to harness the mechanisms that underlie the differential aging of individual stem cells to improve quality of life for the elderly."

"9482744","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protective immune responses rely on the ability of leukocytes to cross endothelial barriers in response to inflammatory stimuli. However, inflammation is a double-edged sword; immune cells attack healthy tissues in situations such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and transplantation. T cell migration into sites f inflammation is tightly regulated by localized chemokine signals, which activate integrin dependent adhesion and cytoskeletal changes needed for migration across endothelial barriers. Transendothelial migration (TEM) is a multi-step process involving tethering and rolling, firm adhesion, crawling, and finally transmigration. TEM represents an important checkpoint in the inflammatory response, and reagents that block this process are therapeutically valuable. We have found that Crk family proteins function in the chemokine pathway leading to integrin activation and cytoskeletal remodeling, and we find that T cells lacking these proteins have defects in adhesion and TEM. Strikingly, we find that these T cells traffic normally to lymphoid organs, but show defects in migration to sites of inflammation. Moreover, these cells can carry out an efficient graft vs leukemia (GvL) response, with minimal graft vs host disease (GvHD). We hypothesize that Crk proteins are required for chemokine-induced integrin activation and cytoskeletal remodeling in T cells, and for corresponding changes in the endothelium that allow transendothelial migration and T cell trafficking into inflamed tissue. This hypothesis will be tested by carrying out following three Aims: First, we will define the mechanisms through which Crk protein signaling in T cells promotes TEM. Using ligand-coated surfaces and endothelial monolayers under shear flow conditions, we will test the ability of Crk/L deficient T cells to undergo individual steps in the TEM process, and test hypothesis that Crk proteins function through both Rap1 and Cdc42 in this context. Second, we will assess endothelial cell responses to Crk/L-deficient T cells. We will test the hypothesis that defects in Crk-dependent integrin activation within the T cell result in a failure to appropriately activate one or more endothelial ell signaling pathways that are required for efficient TEM. Three pathways that function together to weaken endothelial junctional complexes and generate a specialized conduit for T cell passage will be investigated. Third, we will analyze Crk protein dependent T cell trafficking in acute inflammation and GvHD/GvL models. Consistent with their role in controlling TEM, we find that Crk/L deficient T cells show defects in migration into inflamed tissues. Moreover, these cells cause minimal GvHD, even under conditions where they can efficiently eliminate lymphoma. In this aim, we will use animal models to explore Crk protein function in T cell trafficking during an in vivo immune response. We will conduct histological analysis and intravital imaging to study T cell-vessel interactions in inflamed skin. In addition, we will use GvHD and GvHD/GvL models to study T cell trafficking to target organs, and to test our ability to target Crk protein function i a therapeutic setting."
"9573780","ABSTRACT Curing HIV/AIDS requires strategies to purge reservoirs harboring latent, transcriptionally silent proviruses, as HIV persists in CD4+ T memory cells even in the presence of effective highly active antiretroviral therapy. Despite intensive research, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that seed and maintain the HIV reservoir in primary human CD4+ memory T cells remains incomplete. Our preliminary data indicate that interleukin-15 (IL-15), the only gamma cytokine up-regulated during acute HIV infection, increases human CD4+ T memory cell susceptibility to infection by inactivation of the restriction factor SAMHD1. Further, IL-15 specifically increases the number of CD4+ T memory cells with stem cell like properties (TSCM) in HIV-infected CD4+ T cell populations. We hypothesize that HIV infected CD4+ T memory cells with stem cell-like properties (CD4+ T central memory/stem cell-like) initiate and maintain the persistent viral reservoir in patients with controlled viral replication. We will probe the molecular mechanisms controlling infection susceptibility and latency maintenance in primary human CD4+ T cells using established techniques, such as mass-cytometry by time of Flight (CyTOF), genome editing and next generation sequencing. We will identify abortive, silent and productive infections in CD4+ T memory cells, define the cellular programs specific for HIV persistence and modulate these pathways to render CD4+ T memory cells refractory to infection. We will examine how FDA approved JAK1/2 and mTOR inhibitors modulate infection and proliferation of CD4+ T memory cells. We will define cell lineages responsible for HIV persistence in vivo by generating hierarchical maps of patient-derived proviruses inserted at the same genetic location but obtained from distinct CD4+ T memory populations using high-resolution, next generation sequencing approaches. The proposed studies will not only characterize the CD4+ T memory cells that establish and maintain the HIV reservoir, but also examine whether FDA approved therapeutic interventions may be used to prevent latent HIV infection and/or eliminate HIV persistence in the human CD4+ T memory cell compartment."
"9475749","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CD1d-restricted, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells which sense self and microbial lipid antigens are increasingly recognized to play a critical role i inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The current research proposal addresses the unanswered question of how CD1d functions in specific parenchymal and hematopoietic cells in intestines to regulate iNKT cells and how this information relates to the pathogenesis and treatment of IBD. Our long-term goals are to define the specific CD1d+ cells involved in regulating or promoting iNKT cell- mediated inflammation, how exogenous microbial factors (e.g. Bacteroides fragilis sphingolipids) and endogenous factors (e.g. acid sphingomyelinase regulation of sphingomyelin levels) affect these cell-type associated CD1d functions and acquire new insights into the mechanism(s) by which CD1d mediated IL-10 production affects the capabilities of the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) barrier through an examination of Paneth cell (PC) function; a CD1d+ IEC subset. The objective of this research is to elucidate how, at both the molecular and physiological levels, CD1d-restricted iNKT cells pathways function in homeostatic and pathologic responses. Our central hypothesis is that specific subsets of CD1d-bearing cells in intestinal tissues and the lipid antigens presented play a critical role in determining the iNKT cel activity and responsiveness to environmental agents that promote or regulate CD1d-restricted intestinal inflammation. This rationale is derived from recent insights demonstrating early life events impact significantly on later life susceptibility to environmental factors that stimulate CD1d-restricted, iNKT cell mediated intestinal inflammation. Our central hypothesis will be tested with four specific aims: 1) Determine which professional CD1d-bearing antigen presenting cell (APC) subset(s) serves a regulatory role in determining iNKT cell responses. 2) Identify the APC subset required for mediating the protective effects elicited by sphingolipids derived from B. fragilis during early life. 3) Determine the role played by sphingomyelin as an endogenous regulator of CD1d-iNKT cell function. 4) Elucidate mechanisms by which IL-10 derived from the IEC protects the barrier. In Aim 1, we will characterize the role of APC subsets in influencing CD1d-restricted responses and the inflammatory or regulatory behavior of colonic iNKT cells. Aim 2 will elucidate how early life exposure to B. fragilis-derived glycosphingolipids inhibit iNKT cell expansion and prevent CD1d-restricted inflammatory responses during later life by establishing the APC subset(s) and mechanism(s) involved. Aim 3 aims to uncover an endogenous pathway that serves to regulate iNKT cell function in later life through ASM mediated degradation of sphingomyelin. In Aim 4, we seek to understand how CD1d- restricted regulation of IL-10 extends to PC function. Overall, this proposal is significant because it will promote our understanding of how CD1d-restricted, iNKT cell pathways are affected by environmental, genetic and microbial factors and how iNKT cells in turn promote or prevent intestinal inflammation. This research will provide a firm basis upon which to develop a variety of new therapeutic strategies for IBD."

"9463495","Project Summary Repeated, uncontrollable stress is a key contributor to depression and anxiety disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder. Stress causes a series of psychological and physiological adaptations that can be chronic and sustained, and likely contribute to the vulnerability to subsequent bouts of depression and anxiety. On the other hand, some individuals can be exposed to stress repeatedly and appear to be relatively resilient. Given that the serotonin system plays a key role in stress responses and the pharmacological treatment of stress disorders, we presume that the adaptations associated with vulnerability and resilience are represented in cellular and molecular plasticity in the raphe neurons of individuals following exposure to stress, especially in pathways that are involved in signal transduction. This project will use mouse behavioral and molecular strategies to investigate these adaptations and how resilience might be promoted while vulnerability might be prevented or reversed. Aim 1 will examine how modulating signal transduction pathways within serotonergic neurons might alter the behavioral phenotype of animals exposed to repeated social defeat stress. We proposed to express DREADDs that activate Gi or Gs signaling pathways selectively in serotonergic neurons (ePet1-Cre mice). The effects of DREADD activation prior to repeated social defeat on stress responsiveness in behavioral assays of depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors. This Aim will provide new mechanistic and therapeutic clues regarding how plasticity in the serotonin system confers vulnerability or resilience to stress. In Aim 2 we will evaluate whether DREADD-mediated inhibition of serotonergic neurons in the interval after repeated social defeat stress can reverse the enhanced vulnerability to subsequent stressors, using corticosterone responses to restraint and immobility in the forced swim test to assess different domains of stress reactivity. Aim 3 will selectively interrogate the translation of mRNA by selectively expressing ?RiboTag? in the serotonergic neurons of ePET1-Cre mice. RiboTag is an epitope-tagged ribosomal protein that allows for antibody-mediated pull down only of polysomes from target cells derived from a complex cell homogenate (in this case a fresh midbrain tissue punch). Enrichment of mRNA from serotonergic neurons will allow us to perform RNA-seq to investigate the totality of actively translated mRNA at key points during and after stress exposure. We will focus on mRNAs associated with excitability, signal transduction pathways, and cytokine responses, and use pathway analysis to identify co-regulation of mRNA translation in response to stress; this is intended to provide new mechanistic information and new targets for therapeutic development."
"9474130","Project Summary Neuropeptide somatostatin analogs are important therapeutics for the treatment of hormone secreting tumors with annual sales of ~$2.4B. However, currently available peptide depots are effective in only half the patients with growth hormone secreting tumors, and patients with carcinoid tumors can rapidly become resistant to these drugs. Somatostatin analogs act by stimulating the GPCR sst2A, but the currently available agents cause desensitization via internalization of the same receptor, resulting in reduced or complete loss of efficacy. We hypothesized that biased agonists of sst2A that maintain strong Gi activation, but do not cause desensitization, would normalize hormone levels in a greater percentage of patients and improve efficacy in patients not adequately controlled by currently available agents. In Phase I, we began developing compounds to test this hypothesis using assays for both receptor activation and internalization to identify several small molecule, non-peptide agonists that are indeed potent activators of Gi, but with far less propensity for inducing receptor internalization and desensitization. These early results paved the way for Phase II, in which we optimized the leads identified in Phase I to identify compounds with sub-nanomolar potency, selectivity versus a number of off-target activities, and drug-like properties ultimately leading to a Development Candidate. This compound is effective in both acute and chronic studies of GH and IGF-I suppression in rats, exhibits good drug-like characteristics including oral bioavailability and half-life consistent with anticipated once a day dosing in human, and a good safety margin based on preliminary rat studies. The goal of this Phase IIB project is to optimize process chemistry and prepare material which will then be used to conduct IND enabling toxicology studies. This will enable a Phase I clinical trial of the first orally bioavailable, biased somatostatin agonist for the treatment of hormone secreting tumors. Our innovative approach towards the identification of such an agent has proactively incorporated a set of receptor regulatory assays, and if successful, promises to deliver a new cost effective therapeutic agent with a novel pharmacological profile that leads to both improved efficacy and durability of effect. Importantly, the GPCR family is a rich source of proven targets for drug discovery, which share common regulatory and signaling mechanisms. Therefore, if successful, this work will not only provide improved agents for patients with hormone secreting tumors, but will also support a general novel strategy for optimizing agonist drugs that can be exploited to target many other GPCRs."

"9472997","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The majority of gerontological research is focused on understanding biological mechanisms of aging, with a primary goal to develop interventions that slow the aging process in order to enhance healthspan and lifespan. While this approach has proven quite successful in laboratory models, an alternative, and potentially much more powerful strategy, is to focus on interventions that promote rejuvenation of aged cells or animals toward a more youthful state. Mechanisms of rejuvenation have been understudied, however, largely because of the lack of robust and tractable biological models. We believe that we have overcome this barrier by developing a model for rejuvenation of aged somatic cells and regeneration of a youthful reproductive system in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Adult reproductive diapause can be induced by removing the bacterial food source from C. elegans at the transition from L4 to adulthood. ARD animals survive at least 3-fold longer than normal adult C. elegans, but still age as indicated by morphological and structural changes to organelles, cells, and tissues. Upon exit from ARD, these aged animals show a remarkable rejuvenation of both reproductive and somatic tissues that we hypothesize is mediated by protected germline stem cells. Rejuvenated animals go on to have a full lifespan as if they were day 1 adults. The goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms underlying this rejuvenation process, in particular the signals emanating from the protected germline stem cells to restore somatic tissues to their youthful state. Understanding and harnessing these mechanisms will lead to novel strategies to restore aged tissues to a more youthful state in people, thereby promoting healthy aging by preventing age- related pathology that drives disease."
"9530218","Project Summary  Shaken baby syndrome (SBS) or shaken impact syndrome is a form of abusive head injury (AHT) in which a child is subjected to severe repetitive rotational acceleration-deceleration (RAD) forces without blunt impact to the head. Approximately 25 percent of SBS victims die as a result of their injuries. Survivors may suffer permanent physical, neurological and mental disabilities. Little is known about the etiology, pathophysiological implications, and underlying mechanisms, and preventive/therapeutic interventions are lacking. The preliminary findings in a neonatal mouse model of RAD injury (RADi) show that RADi in the developing brain results in [global cerebral blood hypoperfusion], cerebral accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1? (HIF-1?) and activation of its downstream target molecules such as [glucose transporter 1 (Glut 1), nuclear factor like 2 (Nrf2)], heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and aquaporin 4 (AQP4). [At the later stage, HIF-1? is significantly down-regulated with activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), followed by neuronal degeneration and behavioral deficits. Surprisingly, daily acute intermittent hypoxia (dAIH) post- conditioning intervention promotes accumulation of HIF-1?, inhibition of p38 phosphorylation, and recovery of cognitive function in RADi mice.] To date, knowledge of the HIF-1 signaling pathway in the central nervous system (CNS) is still limited and controversial. The precise role of HIF-1? signaling has never been explored in SBS and relevant animal models. In this proposal, it is hypothesized that neuronal activation of HIF-1 signaling plays a [neuroprotective role via inhibiting p38 MAPK activation] following RADi in developing brains. The precise function of HIF-1? [and its effect on p38 MAPK signaling] will be identified in the neonatal RADi mouse with neuron-specific HIF-1? disruption or forced expression just induced before RADi. Furthermore, [inter- regulation of HIF-1? and p38 MAPK as well as their therapeutic potentials will be investigated in sham and RADi mice administrated with vehicle solution, prolyl-4-hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor, and p38 MAPK inhibitor, respectively.] Effects of HIF-1?[/p38 MAPK pathways] on RADi brain will be assessed by quantifying cardiorespiratory function, brain water content, gene expression, neuronal degeneration and apoptosis, [cerebral blood perfusion, magnetic resonance spectroscopy,] and behavior. These findings will likely elucidate the underlying pathological mechanism(s) of RADi and functional deficits in SBS, and suggest early-stage interventions to treat SBS-related neurological and/or psychological sequelae."
"9483546","Project Summary / Abstract Decision-making is central to cognition. It relies on an animal's neural circuitry to integrate information from multiple sensory inputs to arrive at an activity state that guides subsequent behavioral choice. Given the derangement of decision-making processes in patients of mental illnesses like schizophrenia, understanding how neural circuits enable decision-making may help to unravel these diseases. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans offers an excellent model system to study the representation of decision-making in neural activity. It has a simplified nervous system comprising 302 neurons with known connectivity and readily available genetic tools that enable us to monitor and manipulate the activity of single neurons in freely behaving animals. Furthermore, the C. elegans genome contains homologs to genes critical for human nervous system function such as neurotransmitters and ion channels, suggesting that a functional dissection of decision-making in C. elegans could translate to humans in meaningful ways. When C. elegans is exposed to pathogenic bacteria during its first larval stage after hatching, it becomes ?imprinted? to form a lifelong aversive association with the smell of those bacteria. Imprinted adult C. elegans given a choice between the pathogenic bacteria and a harmless kind of bacteria selectively avoid the pathogen, whereas naïve animals do not. Strikingly, the pathogen odor alone remains attractive to imprinted animals, suggesting they make a true decision to avoid pathogen odors by evaluating alternatives. To understand the neuronal and molecular mechanisms that mediate this choice behavior, we propose the following specific aims: 1) to characterize imprinted pathogen avoidance decision behavior by the navigational maneuvers that comprise it; 2) to link activity of key neurons with decision-making behavior using calcium imaging and optogenetics; The completion of these specific aims will yield fundamental insights into the ways circuits represent behavioral outcomes and how learning functionally alters circuits to generate different behaviors from identical sensory inputs. This research plan will provide the ideal training to become an independent researcher studying neural circuits and behavior."
"9496085","Abstract Chronic liver diseases are the 12th leading cause of mortality and among the most common causes of morbidity in the U.S. with 5.5 million people suffering from the diseases. Currently, liver transplantation is the only effective treatment for end-stage liver diseases; however, the shortage of donor livers makes this therapy extremely limited, thus necessitating alternative therapies. Promoting innate liver regeneration in chronic liver diseases is an attractive alternative. Upon liver injury, hepatocytes proliferate to yield more hepatocytes to restore lost liver mass and maintain liver function. However, when hepatocyte proliferation is compromised, a phenomenon observed in advanced liver diseases, liver progenitor cells (LPCs) are activated and these LPCs expand and eventually differentiate into hepatocytes. Thus, it is crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms of LPC- driven liver regeneration, which will provide significant insights into promoting this process as a pro-regenerative therapy for advanced liver diseases. Particularly, given the prevalence of LPCs in chronically diseased livers, promoting LPC differentiation into functional hepatocytes will be a promising pro-regenerative therapy. We have established a zebrafish liver injury model in which hepatocyte-specific overexpression of oncogenes induces oncogene-induced hepatocyte damage, such as senescence and apoptosis, followed by inflammation, LPC activation, fibrosis and eventually LPC-mediated liver repair. Using this chronic liver injury model as a screening tool for identifying small molecules that can promote LPC differentiation into hepatocytes, we discovered that treatment with EGFR inhibitors promoted LPC differentiation into hepatocytes, thereby enhancing liver repair/recovery. In addition to the zebrafish model, we have established a mouse liver injury model for LPC- driven liver regeneration. This mouse model allows us to determine if EGFR inhibition can promote LPC differentiation into hepatocytes in mammals as in fish. Here, we propose to determine the effect of EGFR inhibition on LPC differentiation and the role of EGFR signaling in LPC-driven liver regeneration by pursuing three specific aims. Aim 1: Using two zebrafish models of hepatocyte-specific oncogene overexpression, we will elucidate the process of LPC-driven liver regeneration in oncogene-induced liver damage settings. Aim 2: Using the zebrafish and mouse liver injury models for LPC-driven liver regeneration, we will determine the effects of EGFR inhibition on LPC differentiation into hepatocytes and subsequent liver recovery. Aim 3: We will determine the molecular mechanisms controlling LPC differentiation by investigating the role of EGFR and Sox9 in this differentiation process. Successful accomplishment of the proposed work will not only significantly advance the mechanistic understanding of liver regeneration in the diseased liver, but also lay the groundwork for use of EGFR inhibitors as a promising pro-regenerative agent to augment LPC-driven liver regeneration in patients with advanced liver diseases."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to advance an orally bioavailable first-in-class somatostatin receptor subtype-4 selective drug candidate with disease-modifying attributes for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hit compound has been validated to enhance learning and memory in mouse models of AD and cognitive decline, with a reduction of beta-amyloid (Aß) oligomer levels within the brain. Our program has now advanced to lead optimization, which is accomplished through enhancement of drug-like properties of the lead series in tandem with well-defined advancement criteria, respective to modeling, in vitro screens and in vivo/ex vivo validation. This study will be accomplished via three specific aims. Based on outcomes within each aim, additional design adjustments and testing may be performed. Aim-1: Design and synthesis. Rational drug design strategies employing iterative in silico modeling, synthesis, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies will be conducted to enhance potency and selectivity, reduce potential toxicity, and enhance physiochemical properties for oral bioavailability. Synthetic methods will be further developed and applied to iterative and parallel medicinal chemistry where appropriate. Aim-2: In vitro screens. Using established in vitro methods, critical properties (i.e. solubility, receptor affinity and selectivity, activity, plasma binding, stability, permeability, and toxicity potential will be assessed in a sequential manner to delineate compound viability. Aim-3: In vivo/ex vivo assessments. Compounds meeting necessary criteria will be advanced to pharmacokinetic evaluations (i.v. and p.o.) for further delineation and identification of a primary lead. This lead will be tested via chronic p.o. administration in the 3xTg mouse model of AD at age-dependent intervals that coincide with critical periods of neuropathological development and learning/memory decline. Dosing range will be determined from pharmacokinetic data. Delineation of lead compound impact on learning and memory will be assessed via Morris water-maze, T-maze, and object recognition testing. Following final behavioral testing, cortical and hippocampal tissues will be evaluated to delineate changes in critical proteins/enzymes associated with AD pathology and proposed drug mechanism. This study will culminate in the advancement of a first-in-class AD drug candidate to the next stage of development. The aims of this study address priorities of National Institutes of Health, specific to drug discovery for nervous system disorders respective to drug-candidate lead optimization: FOA number: PAR-13-048."
"9459819","CORE D: MITOCHONDRIAL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION ? SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent findings of this PO1 revealed that treatment of aged mice with the mitochondria-targeted peptide (SS- 31) conferred rapid rejuvenation of mitochondrial bioenergetics, suggesting that SS-31 increases intrinsic mitochondrial plasticity by increasing the capacity of the mitochondrial ETC to produce more ATP at times of increased metabolic demands or decreased fuel supply. The mechanism by which SS-31 increases mitochondrial plasticity is not completely understood, although recent work the Program Project and this Core has now shown that these peptides target the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) because of their high affinity for cardiolipin (CL). By modifying the interaction of CL and cytochrome c (cyt c), SS peptides protect the hexacoordination of the heme Fe to optimize electron transport (ET) and minimize reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. As a result, the SS peptides prevent oxidative stress in the mitochondrial inter membrane space (IMS). The goal of this Mitochondrial Structure and Function Core is to assist all Projects in the PO1 to demonstrate that protection of mitochondrial structure by the SS peptides at the level of cristae architecture and cytochrome c (cyt c) heme ligation can reduce mitochondrial aging in the heart, skeletal muscle and retina. The major services provided by this Core include: Aim 1 is to provide ultrastructural and protein characterization of age and high fat diet-mediated changes in cristae architecture and composition, and protection by SS peptides. Aim 2 is to provide characterization of age- and high fat diet-mediated changes in cyt c heme structure, and protection by SS peptides. This will include providing the resources to assist all Projects in determining the extent of oxidative stress in the mitochondrial IMS and working with Core B to obtain mass-spectrometry confirmation of these oxidized proteins. Aim 3 is to provide methods for studying mitochondrial electron transport chain structures. This will include methods for identifying supercomplexes in mitochondria from retina, heart and skeletal muscles using 2-D native blue gels/SDS gel electrophoresis and specific antibodies for the individual respiratory complex proteins. In summary, this Core will determine if structural changes in mitochondrial cristae and cyt c heme ligation play a role in the inhibition of ET and increase in ROS emission associated with aging. The SS peptides will provide evidence to support the importance of repairing mitochondrial structure in order to restore cellular bioenergetics and allow for repair of cellular structure and function."
"9564038","Alzheimer's disease prevalence is expected to triple by 2050, and current medications do not change the disease course. However, recent studies have projected that up to 30% of Alzheimer's disease may be preventable by targeting modifiable risk factors. Indeed, population-based studies are finding that, although the total number of dementia cases is growing, age-specific incidence rates are declining in parallel with population-level reductions in risk factors such as low education, smoking and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, studies in Europe have demonstrated slower cognitive decline and less cognitive impairment with multi-domain risk reduction interventions. Given the importance of Alzheimer's prevention and the potential benefits of risk reduction for general as well as brain health, even relatively small reductions in Alzheimer's incidence would have a dramatic public health impact. Despite the tremendous promise of the multi-domain risk reduction approach, no primary prevention trials have been performed in the U.S. We propose to conduct a pilot study of a multi-domain Alzheimer's disease risk reduction intervention in the U.S. To maximize feasibility and the potential for implementation, we propose to perform our trial within an integrated healthcare delivery system. In addition, we plan to utilize a personalized intervention, which has proven successful in the healthcare setting for managing conditions such as depression and hypertension, and which should yield greatest change on risk factors. Specifically, we propose to randomize 200 higher-risk older adults (age ?70 with subjective cognitive complaints, performance in the lower end of normal on a cognitive test and ? 2 modifiable risk factors that will be targeted by our intervention) to a two year Multi-domain Alzheimer's Risk Reduction Study (MARRS) intervention or a Health Education (HE) control. In the MARRS intervention group, the team will work with participants to develop a personalized action plan to address risk reduction including cardiovascular risk management; smoking cessation; physical, mental and social activity; healthy diet; improved sleep quality and medication management. The goals of our study are to collect pilot data on the effect of MARRS on 2-year rate of cognitive decline compared to HE (Aim 1); compare changes in Alzheimer's modifiable risk factors (Aim 2); and gather preliminary data on the effect of MARRS versus HE on other important health-related outcomes (Aim 3). We will also compare strategies for identifying higher-risk patients for this and future studies. This innovative pilot trial will provide critically needed information to support a future multi-site trial, with the ultimate goal of delaying or preventing cognitive decline leading to Alzheimer's disease."
"9496581","Abstract Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a pulmonary vasculopathy that remains progressive and life-limiting despite numerous approved vasodilator therapies. Right ventricular (RV) failure is the ultimate determinant of outcome in PAH and in pulmonary hypertension from more common heart and lung diseases, but there are no approved treatments for RV failure. PAH is more common in women, yet women have better RV function and survival as compared to men with PAH. We and others have shown that lower levels of the adrenal steroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate ester increase the risk of PAH in men and women and that lower levels are associated with more severe pulmonary vascular disease, worse RV function, and mortality in PAH independent of other sex hormones including estrogen. DHEA has direct effects on nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) synthesis and signaling, two major pathobiologic drivers and therapeutic targets in PAH, and direct antihypertrophic effects on cardiomyocytes. Our long-range goal is to pursue DHEA as a therapeutic intervention in PAH and RV failure in order to provide precision PAH treatment based on sex or sex hormone milieu. This proposal will test the impact of DHEA on RV phenotype and provide critical mechanistic insights into sexual dimorphism in PAH at the level of the pulmonary vasculature, the RV and in the context of major established treatment targets in PAH. A proof of concept randomized double-blind placebo controlled crossover trial to study DHEA treatment in men (n = 13) and women (n = 13) with PAH is planned. In our first aim, we will determine whether DHEA 50 mg daily for 18 weeks affects RV longitudinal strain measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and markers of maladaptive RV hypertrophy and remodeling. We will also assess the impact of DHEA on downstream hormone levels, other PAH intermediate end points, side effects and safety. Second, we will determine whether active treatment with DHEA affects NO and ET-1 biosynthesis in PAH patients. Third, we will determine whether DHEA enhances NO production and attenuates ET-1 synthesis in pulmonary artery endothelial cells isolated from PAH patients. This work will be the first clinical trial of an endogenous sex hormone in PAH and will provide mechanistic insight into sex-based differences in cardiopulmonary phenotypes, leading to a larger parallel arm Phase II trial of DHEA as a novel RV therapeutic."

"9599882","Seasonal influenza epidemics are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and while prophylactic immunization has proven the most efficient way to prevent influenza so far, influenza vaccines need to be reformulated each year to address the rapid emergence of immune escape mutations and do not provide complete protection. The threat of a pandemic, which arises from the spread of novel strains of influenza A viruses against which most individuals have no or limited immunity, is another major public-health concern. Therefore, innovative approaches to enhance prevention of influenza epidemics and pandemics are highly desirable. Classically, Natural Killer (NK) cells are viewed as nonspecific effector cells of the innate immune system that play critical role(s) in defense against nascent neoplasms and viral infections, including influenza virus infection. Unexpectedly, NK cells have recently been shown to also exhibit adaptive immune functions. In particular, antigen-specific memory NK cell responses have been demonstrated in mice and in nonhuman primates. Preliminary data presented in this application now show the first evidence of virus-specific NK cell responses in humans and suggest that immunization with live attenuated influenza strains enhances influenza- specific killing by NK cells. These exciting data suggest that harnessing influenza-specific NK cell function might significantly enhance the protective effect mediated by vaccines. However, whether human NK cells mount long-lived influenza-specific responses able to protect against infection with a broad range of influenza strains remains to be fully determined. Here, we propose to build on our preliminary data in humans and use humanized BLT mice to experimentally evaluate transferrable NK cell memory responses and investigate the overarching hypothesis that influenza-specific NK cells with potent antiviral activity develop in humans and can mediate protection against influenza. Those questions will be addressed through two Specific Aims: (i) To characterize influenza-specific NK cells in individuals receiving influenza vaccination; and (ii) To assess the capacity of human NK cells to mediate protective responses against influenza infection through recognition and recall of influenza antigens in humanized mice. The results of these innovative explorative studies could provide the rationale to harness antigen-specific NK cell responses to improve the design of future influenza vaccines."
"9585534","Dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya (CHIKV) are medically important arboviruses causing severe human disease worldwide and in regions of the US, but optimal serologic diagnosis is lacking?a disconcerting problem for returning travelers, pregnant women, and those living in endemic regions. Since a large proportion of DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV infections are asymptomatic, patients seeking medical care for acute infection only represent the ?tip of the iceberg?. Furthermore, existing serologic tests for DENV and ZIKV are compromised by cross-reactive antibody responses. Thus, the true population immunity and susceptibility to arboviral infections remains unclear. At the patient level, precise knowledge of recent and past arbovirus infection is needed to inform clinical decisions, whereas at the population level, precise knowledge of immunity and attack rates (including asymptomatic infection) is needed to prioritize interventions such as vaccination. Our long-term goal is to develop highly sensitive and specific oral fluid (OF) multiplex arbovirus diagnostics that pave the way for future OF point-of-care tests. Our objective here is to develop and validate tests for differential detection of IgG specific for ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV infection using oral fluid (OF) specimens. Our hypothesis is that pathogen-specific IgG in OF will reflect the antibody (Ab) binding profile observed in serum, and that novel ZIKV-, DENV-, and CHIKV-specific antigens can be integrated into a multiplex Ab binding assay that confers adequate sensitivity and specificity for detecting convalescent phase arbovirus infection. The feasibility of our goal is supported by our published work demonstrating that OF hepatitis E virus (HEV) IgG assays perform equally well as blood based HEV diagnostics and by our preliminary data demonstrating the differential detection of DENV- and ZIKV-specific IgG in plasma and matched OF using novel recombinant antigens. To achieve our goal we will pursue two aims: 1) Build a well-characterized OF panel with matched plasma to develop OF arbovirus diagnostics; and 2) Optimize and validate the multiplex OF arbovirus Ab assays. For aim 1 we will leverage four ongoing studies to build a singular collection of matched OF and blood specimens for optimization and validation of arbovirus OF diagnostics: 1) a human DENV vaccination and post-vaccination challenge study; 2) the first human ZIKV challenge study; 3) a study of returning US travelers with DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV infections; and 4) a mother-infant cohort in Nicaragua where DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV are endemic. Our multi-disciplinary team has in-depth expertise in controlled human vaccine and epidemiologic arbovirus field studies, in novel arbovirus antigen development, arbovirus serodiagnostics, and in oral fluid diagnostics. Our approach is innovative because it represents the most comprehensive endeavor to produce a multiplex OF arbovirus Ab assay and to validate it using real-world specimens. The proposed research would revolutionize public health efforts by providing a practical tool to refine the spatial and temporal scales of arbovirus surveillance and prioritization of vaccine and vector control interventions for disease prevention."

"9600568","Project Summary  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a serious condition with the highest incidence and prevalence in Northern Europe and North America. Following industrialization and cultural implementation of a Westernized life style, a significant rise in UC has also been observed in Asia. UC is a long-term condition that results in colon and rectum inflammation, impacting the quality of life and potentially leading to colorectal cancer. The cause of UC is unknown. Basic research in genetically modified animal models coupled with high throughput sequencing technology to examine altered regulatory events because of disease has been of significant value in elucidating the pathophysiological factors involved in UC. Nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) interacts with a host of transcriptional factors that repress and transrepress families of genes that are closely associated with inflammatory events. The importance of intrinsic NCoR1 in intestinal homeostasis was first discovered in our laboratory when we generated intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) specific NCoR1 deletion mice (NCoR1?IEC) and identified the role of NCoR1 in regulating IEC proliferation and enterocyte maturation during neonatal development. When adult wild-type mice are treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), an important experimental agent used in this discipline, the mice develop UC. In comparison to wild-type mice, NCoR1?IEC mice treated with DSS exhibit increased susceptibility to weight loss and colitis, heightened by a significant decrease in proliferative Ki67+ cells accentuated by a dramatic drop in mitotic Lgr5 gene expression. Furthermore, we discovered that IEC-NCoR1 deletion in naïve (water exposure only) NCoR1?IEC mice leads to accelerated cell proliferation along with transcriptional inhibition of various antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including Reg4, Ang4, and Itln1. In colon tissue, AMPs are produced by Paneth-like deep crypt secretory (DCS) cells, which are intimately coupled with mucin-producing goblet cells to form the first line of innate defense in protecting IECs and the intestinal stem cells (ISC) that reside at the bottom of the crypts. Therefore, we hypothesis that ?intestinal NCoR1 protects crypt cells through regulating the function of colonic secretory cells?. By utilizing both naïve and DSS-treated NCoR1F/F and NCoR1?IEC mice, we will examine ISC proliferation, migration and apoptosis. We will also determine the impact on mucus thickness, goblet cell maturation, and regulation of DSC secretory markers. These studies will help us determine if altered AMPs and mucins in NCoR1?IEC mice lead to bacteria penetration and crypt cell apoptosis. In addition, global genomic studies will be initiated to identify molecules and pathways that are associated with the differentiation and maturation of goblet and DCS cells. Included in these pathways will be examination of the role played by IL-18, an important epithelial- derived cytokine involved in regulating goblet cell maturation which is repressed in IECs by NCoR1. We will determine the possibility that NCoR1 maintains intestinal homeostasis through regulating cytokine IL-18 signaling."

The major human pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) is well known to develop hypervirulence following mouse passage and during infection, but there is significant inter-strain variation in the rates of hypervirulence development. The main mutations driving GAS hypervirulence occur in the control of virulence sensor kinase, CovS, which represses virulence factor encoding genes via phosphorylation of its cognate response regulator, CovR. The GAS hyaluronic acid capsule has been considered essential to the hypervirulence enabled by CovS inactivation, but we have isolated two capsule- deficient serotype M4 GAS strains from a point-source mini-outbreak of invasive human infections. Despite being genetically identical, one of these isolates spontaneously acquires a CovS-inactivating mutation identical to that previously identified in a hypervirulent clinical serotype M1 strain. These findings set the stage for this proposal, which seeks to understand what intrinsic factors control the variation in the emergence of hypervirulence in GAS strains. In aim 1, we will assess whether acapsular GAS strains can develop hypervirulence via CovS inactivation by comparing the virulence of wild-type and CovS-inactivated acapsular serotype M4 strains using two murine models that mimic human disease. Additionally, the ability of acapsular serotype M4 strains to develop the CovS- inactivated, hypervirulent phenotype following mouse passage will be compared to that of an encapsulated serotype M1 strain. We have also identified key GAS cell surface proteins that are upregulated following CovS inactivation in an acapsular serotype M4 strain, but not in encapsulated M1 and M3 strains. We will analyze the role of these cell surface proteins in GAS hypervirulence by comparing serotype M4 strains that are wild-type, covS-inactivated and lacking specific CovRS-regulated downstream target genes, in a murine model of invasive GAS disease. Specific aim 2 will address the novel hypothesis that differential methylation patterns, and not DNA sequence, contribute to the emergence of hypervirulent GAS using our unique set of clinical serotype M4 strains that are genetically identical, but show differential ability to acquire CovS mutation. We will generate the first methylome data for hemolytic streptococci and correlate this with transcriptome data to identify the impact of methylation differences on gene regulation pathways that might influence the emergence of hypervirulence. Targeted inactivation of the GAS orphan DNA methylase will enable us to assess the contribution of these enzymes to observed methylation profiles. Completion of this research will bring us a step closer to answering the 100 year old question ?why only certain GAS strains develop hypervirulence? and help design more in-depth investigations designed to dissect the mechanisms underlying the emergence of hypervirulence in GAS."
"9482006","PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The sterile alpha motif (SAM) and HD-domain containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) plays important roles in the intrinsic immunity defense and potently blocks post-entry infection of HIV-1 early at a stage of reverse transcription in non-dividing human immune cells. Mutations in SAMHD1 are associated with human diseases including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the autoimmune condition Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS). SAMHD1 is a deoxyribonucleotide triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase). The dNTPase activity of SAMHD1 is critical for cellular dNTP regulation in mammalian cells. The antiviral activity of SAMHD1 is negatively modulated in dividing cells by phosphorylation at residue T592. Murine SAMHD1 (mSAMHD1), which is 72% sequence identical to human SAMHD1 (hSAMHD1), also restricts HIV-1 through its dNTPase activity. Interestingly, there are two isoforms of mSAMHD1, with the antiviral activity of isoform 1 (iso1) regulated by phosphorylation at residue T634, while isoform 2 (iso2) lacks this site. Despite intensive investigation, the mechanism of viral restriction by SAMHD1, particularly the function of the SAM domain, still remains unclear and controversial.  The overall goal of the proposed research is to further establish the biochemical and structural basis by which full-length SAMHD1 inhibits retroviral infection and the regulatory mechanisms of SAMHD1 activities. We hypothesize that both the SAM domain and phosphorylation modulate SAMHD1 dNTPase and antiviral activities. To achieve our goals, we will use a combination of techniques including biochemistry, biophysics, structural and molecular biology, cell biology, and virology to elucidate the regulation of the enzyme activities and antiviral functions. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1. To elucidate the activities of mouse SAMHD1 in retroviral restriction. Aim 2. To delineate the regulatory function of the SAM domain in SAMHD1. Aim 3. To establish a comprehensive description of SAMHD1 regulation by phosphorylation.  The success of the proposed work will greatly advance the mechanistic understanding of SAMHD1, an important host immune strategy to combat HIV. It will establish the relevance of SAMHD1 enzymatic activities in its retroviral restriction and other cellular functions. Understanding the functional attributes of the mouse enzyme will provide novel information to improve the mouse model for investigating the replication of retroviruses in vivo. A comprehensive understanding of the regulation and modulation of the enzymatic activities of SAMHD1 is crucial for assessing its potential as a therapeutic target for AIDS, certain cancers and autoimmune diseases."
"9508044","Infectious organisms are a major cause of poor pregnancy outcome, including prematurity, growth retardation, stillbirth, congenital deformity and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Even if the maternal circulation is cleared of infection, persistent viral infection of the placenta is a major outcome of maternal infection, with severe consequences for the infant. Further, the placenta can be a source of persistent maternal systemic infection. Despite the dire consequences of persistent placental infection, we do not fully understand the mechanisms enough to generate targeted interventions in infected mothers. We have developed a mouse model of maternal infection with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis virus LCMV and observed that although the maternal circulation is cleared within 8 days of infection, the placenta remains persistently infected and so does the uterus many days post-partum. We have evidence suggesting that this is related to CD8 T cell function, as manipulation of the cytokine milieu increases both presence and function of these cells and is associated with decreased viral load. Understanding mechanisms for metabolic change in immune cells is becoming a major area of interest. Due to their exponential expansion in response to antigen stimulation, the effect of metabolism in T cells is recognized as critical. In addition to proliferation, changes in metabolism can also affect effector function (e.g. cytokine secretion, cytotoxicity). We, like others, have found that this is particularly true for CD8 T cells and through our collaborator, Dr. Rincon and her examination of this, she has discovered a unique protein, Methylation-Controlled J protein (MCJ) that regulates mitochondrial metabolism in CD8 T cells. Importantly, deficiency in this molecule leads to enhanced metabolism and function, as well as overall improvement in immunologic memory in the setting of influenza infection. In this R21 application, we propose to i) test the hypothesis that there is downregulation of placental CD8 T cell effector function through upregulation in MCJ and ii) test the hypothesis that deficiency in MCJ leads to decreased placental virus after maternal infection with LCMV. These studies are in keeping with renewed interest in maternal immunity in NIAID, as they will advance our understanding of microbe-vector-host interactions and their influence on pregnancy outcomes."
"9459821","PROJECT 1: MITOCHONDRIAL ROS AND CARDIAC AGING ? PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Aging is accompanied by slowly progressive and irreversible structural changes and functional declines in the heart that include increased prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy, decline in diastolic function, and a decline in exercise capacity that contributes to frailty in the elderly. Extending work begun with mitochondrial targeted catalase, mCAT, we have recently demonstrated that short term (8 week) treatment with the mitochondrial protective drug SS-31 ?rejuvenates? cardiac function in old mice, reducing hypertrophy, improving diastolic function and remodeling the cardiac structure and proteome to a more youthful state. We hypothesize that SS-31 enhanced mitochondrial energetics and redox signaling subsequently result in remodeling of the cardiomyocyte and extracellular matrix to a more youthful state. This proposal will define the mechanisms that mediate both acute mitochondrial (Aim 1) and subacute cardiomyocyte and extracellular matrix (Aim 2) rejuvenating effects. As this approach offers the promise of substantial improvement in cardiac health of older humans, Aim 3 will help establish the potential longer-term benefits of these changes to murine healthspan and lifespan. Specifically, in Aim 1 In order to test the hypothesis that treatment with SS-31 restores redox and energy dependent signaling that results in improved mitochondrial structure and function we will measure mitochondrial and cardiac function, comparing and contrasting the mechanisms of mCAT, SS- 20 and SS-31 effects and their ability reverse cardiac aging in old mice and to protect mice challenged with doxorubicin to disrupt electron transport chain function. In Aim 2 we will determine the mechanisms by which SS-31 treatment of old mice rejuvenates cardiomyocytes and extracellular matrix (ECM) to improve aging diastolic function and cardiac performance. Aim 3 is shared across the entire P01, and will establish the translational benefits of SS-31 by determining whether SS31 can attenuate the decline of murine healthspan and extend lifespan after SS-31 is continuously delivered to mice beginning at middle age on regular and high fat diets. In this aim Project 1 will focus on cardiac healthspan."
"9505993","SUMMARY: JHU Center for Neuroscience Research In this revised competitive renewal of our ?JHU Center for Neuroscience Research? NINDS P30 center grant, we propose to both maintain and expand two of the Scientific Core facilities at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHU SOM) that have anchored this Center for the past 10 years: the Multiphoton Imaging (MPI) Core and the Murine Mutagenesis Core (MMC; formally ?ES Cell Engineering Core?). These Scientific Cores currently provide critical research capabilities and resources that are impractical for neuroscience investigators to provide on their own but that greatly enhance efforts of individual research programs. The experimental opportunities and technical services offered by these Cores complement, but do not duplicate, other facilities available to NINDS-funded investigators at JHU SOM. Use of Center Cores will continue to benefit the 12 NINDS-funded research programs that constitute the Primary Center Investigators of this Center, and also other NINDS-funded and non-NINDS-funded investigators at JHU SOM. The research programs of the Primary Center Investigators address a wide range of significant unsolved questions central to the NINDS mission. These include basic neuroscience investigation into excitatory synapse dynamics and function, the organization of hippocampal place cell circuitry, definition of cortical circuits underlying somatosensation, establishment of local circuitry during adult neurogenesis, cellular and molecular mechanisms of pain and itch, and Ca++ signaling in Na channel regulation. Clinically relevant work encompasses the genetics and molecular underpinnings of stroke, Parkinson's Disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism spectrum disorders, and sleep. The unique capabilities of Center Cores will continue to serve as a crucial resource for NINDS-funded investigators at JHU by extending the research capabilities of individual investigators and by serving as a focal point for dissemination and practical training in state-of-the art research approaches. Through these efforts, the JHU Center for Neuroscience Research will help establish new strategies for studying brain function in health and disease that will benefit the broader neuroscience community."
"9395323","ABSTRACT Nicotine withdrawal symptoms (e.g., increased negative affect, decreased positive affect, cigarette craving, hunger) are a core component of nicotine dependence that maintain cigarette smoking and inhibit cessation efforts. The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has increased dramatically in recent years, among smokers and non-smokers, with studies demonstrating that e-cigarettes can reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms during acute cigarette abstinence. E-cigarettes with flavorings that simulate the sweet taste of fruit, candy and other sugary foods and beverages are widely available, commonly used and are frequently cited as a reason for the persistent use of e-cigarettes. During nicotine withdrawal, sweet tastes and flavorings have been shown to reduce withdrawal symptoms, and recent studies have found that sweet-flavorings enhance the appeal of e- cigarettes. However, it is unknown if sweet flavored e-cigarettes can reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms. This behavioral pharmacology laboratory experiment will assess whether sweet (vs. non-sweet) flavored e- cigarettes reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms and motivation to smoke among 40 e-cigarette naïve adult smokers interested in trying e-cigarettes (for the first time) following 16-hours of nicotine abstinence. The study's experimental design will provide evidence of the causal effects of e-cigarette flavorings on a putatively critical factor for determining whether smokers continue e-cigarette use after initial trial?the ability of a product to suppress withdrawal and motivation to smoke during periods of tobacco deprivation. The proposed project also offers an excellent training opportunity for the applicant, providing a unique opportunity to conduct original research and begin the path to becoming a successful independent investigator."

"9601515","A Novel Droplet Digital PCR Method for Population-based  Plasmodium falciparum hrp2 Deletion Diagnosis  Project Summary Malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the tropics and subtropics. Malaria treatment, control and elimination is a top public health priority. Diagnosis of malaria parasites in febrile cases in order to administer appropriate treatment is a major challenge. Current rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that rely on detecting proteins secreted by malaria parasite in the human blood represent a crucial tool for malaria diagnosis in the field, particularly in resource-poor areas where microscopes and electricity are lacking. Over 300 million RDTs were sold in 2014 worldwide, and over two thirds of malaria diagnosis in Africa were based on RDT. The most sensitive RDTs to diagnose Plasmodium falciparum ? the deadliest malaria parasite ? rely on detection of the Histidine Rich Protein 2 (HRP2). Yet, several studies have documented hrp2 gene deletion in the parasite, rendering RDTs unable to detect these parasites. Available protocols to screen for hrp2 deletion require a series of PCR, facing an inherent risk of false negative results. Here, we propose to develop a novel and rapid assay to screen for parasite gene deletions using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The preliminary studies found that this method is highly sensitive, minimizes the risk of false-negative results, and can detect mixed infections with hrp2-delection and wildtype parasites. The objective of this application is to: 1) develop and validate the ddPCR method for detecting hrp2 deletion, and 2) test the hypothesis that the frequency of hrp2- negative P. falciparum parasites has increased due to the selection pressure of HRP2-based diagnosis, and that hrp2-negative P. falciparum parasites are widespread. A unique aspect of this project is the linkage with study sites under NIH-funded International Center of Excellence in Malaria Research (ICEMR) and samples from Africa, Asia, the South Pacific and Latin America will be analyzed. The outcome of this application includes: 1) a rapid and sensitive hrp2 deletion detection method, and 2) understanding the extent of hrp2 deletion in a large multi-continental scale. This knowledge will inform whether the current RDT diagnosis technique grossly misdiagnoses malaria infections and where complementary diagnostic methods should be used."

"9603976","Project Summary This proposal investigates the regulation of three selected genes that encode proteins that are critical for anaphylaxis that is mediated by IgE and mast cells (MCs). MCs release inflammatory mediators, including histamine, in response to antigen crosslinking of the IgE/FceRI complex; these mediators play a major role in causing IgE-mediated anaphylactic shock. Although much is known about the proteins that are involved in MC activation, signal transduction and mediator synthesis, little is known about how the genes that encode these critical proteins are regulated. We and others have demonstrated that the transcription factors (TFs) GATA2 and MITF are essential for MC development and maintenance. However, it remains largely unexplored how these and additional TFs interact with their target enhancers to regulate the expression of target genes that are important in mediating histamine synthesis, MC activation, and IgE-mediated disorders, including anaphylaxis and food allergy. Our long-term goal is to enhance fundamental understanding of the regulation of MC genes that influence food allergy susceptibility and severity. Our central hypothesis is that GATA2 and MITF detect MC activation signals, induce chromatin accessibility in genes essential in the anaphylactic pathway, and recruit other TFs to form a promoter/enhancer transcription complex that activates Hdc gene transcription in a switch-like manner (Hdc encodes histidine decarboxylase, the rate limiting enzyme in histamine synthesis). This central hypothesis is strongly supported by our preliminary data and will be tested in 3 aims that are conceptually innovative and make use of innovative technology. In Aim 1, we will determine how the TFs GATA2, MITF, MECOM and their target promoters and enhancers regulate the expression of Hdc and two other genes that are essential in the IgE/MC-mediated anaphylactic pathway: Fcer1a, which encodes the IgE- binding chain of the high affinity IgE receptor, and Pi3p85, which encodes the P85 regulatory chain of PI3K kinase, a signaling molecule required for MC degranulation. In Aim2, we will identify the enhancers and their associated TFs that regulate these genes in humans. In Aim3, we will analyze the function of Hdc enhancers in IgE/MC-mediated anaphylaxis. Upon completion of the planned studies, we will understand substantially more about the mechanisms through which MCs mediate anaphylaxis in both mouse and human. The acquired knowledge should promote understanding of gene regulation in general and the regulation of genes that influence food allergy susceptibility and severity in particular. As a result, these studies should promote the development of effective interventions to prevent and treat food allergy and other IgE-mediated allergic disorders."

"9479243","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blood monocytes circulate in the periphery as predominantly two subsets: classical and non- classical, or patrolling, monocytes. It has been shown that classical monocytes contribute early on to the process of atherosclerosis by adhering to the vasculature and migrating to the inner layers of the vessel wall, primarily using selectins and integrins, to eventually become foam cells, leading to a chronic inflammatory state within the vascular layers. The endothelial layer of the blood vessel also becomes activated, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as upregulating integrin ligands such as VCAM-1. Non-classical monocytes have been shown to migrate to plaque sites, although they are less frequent than classical monocytes inside the plaque and upregulate different cell surface markers. During steady state, these non-classical monocytes will spend prolonged times crawling non-directionally along the endothelium to survey the vasculature, although more frequently found in smaller vessels than larger vessels. We have found that during atherogenesis, by feeding mice a western diet that is high in fat and cholesterol, there is a significant increase in the patrolling activity of non-classical monocytes. Previous work in our lab has suggested that these monocytes are atheroprotective, as their absence leads to increases in plaque size and inflammatory monocyte numbers. The function of these non-classical monocytes in atherosclerosis, and the exact mechanism of patrolling, is still unclear, but by studying how non-classical monocytes are activated by this disease, we may be able to elucidate a novel target for treating vascular inflammation and plaque formation."

"9506312","Project Summary  Successful perception of the world requires that the human brain assemble diverse sensory information into common, well-formed groupings, a process known as categorical perception (CP). At its core, CP is known as the ?invariance-? or ?many-to-one mapping? problem: an infinite collection of sensory features must be converted into a finite, invariant perceptual space to be acted upon by the perceptual system. Categorization manifests in nearly all aspects of human cognition and learning including the perception of faces, colors, and music. Skilled categorization is particularly important in the context of spoken and written language as evident by its integral role in reading acquisition and auditory-based learning disorders (e.g., dyslexia, specific language impairment). Despite a wealth of behavioral studies and its importance to understanding receptive human communication, the neural mechanisms underlying the core ability of CP remain poorly understood. In a series of studies, the proposed work will address foundational questions of when, where, and how the brain converts continuous acoustic signals into discrete, meaningful categories exploited by the perceptual system. High-density neuroelectric brain recordings (EEG/ERP) will be obtained from human listeners during tasks designed to tap different attributes of categorical processing and modulate its neurobiology. Our central hypothesis is that auditory categorization skills recruit a common, parsimonious frontotemporal neural network that is both dynamically and differentially engaged depending on attention, familiarity of stimulus context/complexity, learning, and prior listening experience. Novel multivariate analytic techniques will be used to derive ?neurometric functions? from listeners? ERPs to ?decode? listeners? speech perception behaviors from their underlying brain activity. This common neurocomputational approach will be used to investigate several factors that modulate auditory categorization skills through five research aims: (Aim 1) the spatiotemporal emergence of CP in the brain; (Aim 2) linear vs. nonlinear signal dynamics; (Aim 3) identifying sounds from different domains (e.g., speech vs. music); (Aim 4) prior listening experience and novel learning. Aim 5 will measure functional connectivity from EEG recordings to determine how the directed flow of information within the CP brain network changes with the manipulations of prior aims (e.g., learning vs. processing mature categories). Providing a more complete biological description of the acoustic-to-phonetic mapping problem of CP will ultimately offer a window into not only normal speech perception but may reveal important neural mechanisms to target in disorders that impair the formation of auditory categories."
"9522472","7. Project Summary/Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD) is a growing threat to public health: 24% of all adults, and over half of those with obesity or Type 2 diabetes (T2D), have NAFLD, which confers increased risk for liver failure, T2D, and cardiovascular disease. NAFLD is predicted to be the leading indication for liver transplantation by 2020. Although diet and exercise are proven to improve NAFLD, lifestyle changes are difficult to maintain for many patients. Currently there are no highly effective pharmacologic treatments for NAFLD, and significant need exists for therapeutic strategies to complement lifestyle changes. This proposal investigates a novel strategy to reduce liver fat and inflammation using growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), which augments endogenous GH secretion. On average, individuals with obesity have significant reductions in growth hormone secretion, which we hypothesize to contribute to the pathophysiology of NAFLD by promoting a pro- inflammatory milieu and altering hepatic lipid metabolism, increasing hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Our preliminary data demonstrate that GHRH decreases liver fat in HIV-infected individuals and, in obese individuals, reduces systemic inflammation and improves carotid intima-media thickness, a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. These data support the need to study the effects of GHRH on liver fat and histology in obese individuals with NAFLD. The current research is proposed by collaborating Co-Principal Investigators, Dr. Corey, a hepatologist with significant investigative and clinical research experience in NAFLD, and Dr. Stanley, an endocrinologist with significant research experience in hormone dynamics, lipid metabolism, and use of GHRH. The proposal will investigate the efficacy of GHRH in a 12-month randomized controlled trial in 76 obese adults who have established NAFLD on liver biopsy or ?5% hepatic fat fraction on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). A 6-month open-label phase will follow the randomized phase in order to provide all participants with the opportunity to receive active treatment. The study hypotheses are as follows: Aim 1: Compared to placebo, GHRH will significantly decrease hepatic fat as measured by MRS (primary endpoint) and improve liver histology as assessed by reduction in NAFLD activity score and its individual components. Aim 2: GHRH will alter hepatic lipid metabolism by decreasing hepatic de novo lipogenesis and increasing expression of lipolytic genes, and will also reduce the hepatic expression of lipogenic, pro- inflammatory and fibrogenic genes. Aim 3: Finally, given that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in NAFLD, and that preliminary data strongly suggest a benefit of GHRH to reduce subclinical atherosclerosis, we hypothesize that GHRH will decrease coronary artery calcium scores and overall plaque burden and will improve lipids and circulating markers of cardiovascular disease. If these hypotheses are correct, the proposed studies will represent significant progress toward the development of therapies for NAFLD in obesity."
"9480869","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The exploration and interpretation of large, complex datasets is vital to discovery in genomics. However, researchers now confront a fundamental limitation; unprecedented experiments are possible thanks to modern DNA sequencing technologies, yet existing genome arithmetic techniques for comparing and dissecting the resulting datasets are incapable of keeping pace with inexorable growth in dataset size and complexity. Genome arithmetic (GA) represents a powerful and widely used set of techniques that allow one to explore relationships among sets of genome features (e.g., a gene, sequence alignment, ChIP-seq peak, or anything that can be described with chromosome coordinates). GA is used for a broad spectrum of analyses including: the detection of intersecting/overlapping features (e.g., sequence alignments and exons), describing feature coverage among datasets, and the merging, subtraction, and complementation of feature datasets. GA functionality is used by all genome browsers and data visualization tools, and by analysis software such as GATK and SAMTOOLS. Owing to its power and flexibility, own BEDTOOLS software is extremely popular and is used in a broad range of complex genomic analyses. However, while GA is central to genomic analysis and discovery, the core algorithms employed by all existing tools are inherently incapable of keeping pace with the scale and diversity of modern genomic datasets. Restricted to these approaches, the present analytic bottleneck will become increasingly acute.  Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to provide the genomics community with innovative new algorithms and software that keep pace with modern genomics experiments and facilitate future discoveries. The Specific Aims are to: (1) Create an ecosystem and software that allows researchers to easily integrate diverse genome annotations and datasets into their research. We will develop new tools that make it easy and reproducible for researchers to collect datasets germane to a given experiment. (2) Dramatically expand the utility, flexibility, and performance of BEDTOOLS. We will devise and implement new algorithms for scalable and flexible analysis of large-scale genome datasets. (3) Develop a workbench for visualizing and quantifying the biological significance of relationships among genomic datasets. We will leverage the technologies from Aims 1 and 2 to develop a comprehensive statistical and visualization workbench for the R statistical package that will allow researchers to detect biological relationships among genome datasets. The proposed research will devise entirely new, scalable approaches for genome arithmetic. This will provide the community with powerful new techniques for exploring and interpreting genomics experiments and give tool developers robust approaches for software development and improvement."
"9457450","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due the limitations of both simulation and experiment, an ultimate understanding of protein folding will come from a coupled approach of detailed simulations extensively validated and tested by experiment. However, developing simulation methodology which can quantitatively connect with experimental kinetics still remains a great theoretical challenge, due to the long timescales involved and the difficulties and complexities of detailed, atomistic models. Here, we propose new, third generation distributed computing methods to tackle these challenges and the application of these methods to questions related to how proteins self-assemble in solution as well as in the biologically relevant contexts. While protein folding has itself been studied computationally for many years, our work differs from other approaches in (1) its use of innovative distributed computing methods for simulating long, biologically relevant time scale kinetics (on the millisecond to second timescale - dramatically longer than the previous state of the art) and for large and complex proteins (on the 100+ amino acid length scale) using detailed, fully atomistic, explicit solvent models and (2) the application of these detailed models to address questions of folding in the biological contexts of different environments in the cell. Moreover, we are able to perform a quantitative comparison to experiment, which is critical for both the testing and greater impact of our computational methods; indeed, key experimental collaborations using cutting edge methods are proposed to make direct connections to our proposed simulations. Finally, the proposed work would have an impact on our basic understanding of several protein-related diseases, such protein misfolding diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease and Huntington's Disease. Indeed, methodology from the previous project period has already lead to advances in the simulation of peptide aggregation in Alzheimer's and Huntington's Disease. Also, by understanding the nature of folding in biological contexts, such as in the presence of membranes, in biologically confined spaces, and with crowding agents, and by directly comparing those simulations to novel experiments of folding in the cell, we would gain insight into the nature of protein folding in viv, which is the next important step in our understanding of protein folding and its connection to biology and biomedical questions."
"9609711","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chlamydia is the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection in the US. Infections are usually asymp- tomatic and often go untreated which can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular pathogen that establishes its replication niche in host epithelial cells within a membrane-bound compartment called the inclusion. C. trachomatis intracellular replication de- pends on the secretion of bacterial effector proteins through a type III secretion system. These effectors are translocated into the cytosol of the host cell and some effectors, called Inc proteins, are embedded in the inclu- sion membrane. Inc proteins have tails facing the host cell cytosol and can interact with and manipulate host cell molecules. Our lab has shown that the inclusion membrane establishes close contacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which we termed ER-inclusion membrane contact sites (MCS). In uninfected cells, the ER es- tablishes MCS with various organelles allowing for the non-vesicular transfer of lipids, ion exchange, and cell signaling. Previously, we have shown that ER-inclusion MCS harbor the Chlamydia Inc protein IncD, the host ceramide transfer protein CERT, and the ER-resident VAP proteins and proposed a role for the IncD-CERT-VAP complex in the transfer of ceramide to the inclusion. Recently, we have focused our efforts on understanding the mechanisms by which the ER and the inclusion membranes are brought and maintained in close proximity. In a recent publication, I have shown that the Inc protein IncV interacts with VAP by molecular mimicry of eukaryotic FFAT motifs. My data indicate that while the IncV-VAP complex is sufficient to mediate ER-inclusion MCS for- mation, it is not essential, suggesting that redundant mechanisms exist. Here, I propose to further investigate the mechanisms used by Chlamydia to tether the ER to the inclusion. Specifically, I will determine the mechanism supporting the IncV-dependent formation of MCS (Aim1) and characterize the respective contributions of the IncV-VAP and IncD-CERT-VAP complexes (Aim2). My central hypothesis is that ER-inclusion MCS formation relies on the recruitment of the ER-resident VAP protein through interaction with the Chlamydia Inc proteins IncV and IncD. Since ER-inclusion MCS are necessary for the Chlamydia lifecycle, my approach may reveal novel therapeutic targets for therapeutic intervention."
"9478017","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed work is aimed at unraveling the molecular mechanism by which telomeres prevent the activation of DNA damage signaling pathways at chromosome ends. The loss of telomere protection and the resulting signaling by DNA damage response pathways is the root cause of the premature aging symptoms in Dyskeratosis congenita and other telomeropathies. Furthermore, telomere dysfunction is a key factor in the early stages of cancer, a disease strongly correlated with aging. Our work in the past funding period has illuminated how the telomere associated shelterin complex blocks the activation of the ATM and ATR kinase signaling cascades at chromosome ends. Using genetically modified mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) with conditional alleles for the seven mouse shelterin factors, we have determined which shelterin subunits are required for the repression of the ATM and ATR pathways. This work has revealed a remarkable division of labor within shelterin where TRF2 is primarily responsible for the repression of ATM signaling whereas the POT1 proteins repress the ATR pathway. Using super-resolution STORM imaging in combination with a new chromatin spreading method, we have provided evidence that TRF2 represses the ATM kinase pathway through remodeling telomeres into the t-loop configuration. We have also provided evidence that the POT1 proteins repress ATR signaling through the exclusion of RPA, the single-stranded DNA sensor of the ATR pathway. In AIMs 1 and 2 of the current proposal, we will further test these two models. We propose to use our extensive collection of genetically modified MEFs in combination with STORM imaging, specifically engineered shelterin rescuing alleles, cell biological tests for the DNA damage response, and biochemical approaches with purified shelterin to test the t-loop model for ATM repression and the RPA-exclusion model for ATR repression. This work will be complemented with TALENs-mediated deletion of shelterin proteins in human cells to verify that data obtained with our mouse models are consistent with the human setting. In AIM 3, we will initiate a new line of investigation to determine how shelterin represses a third threat to telomeres - the activation of the poly(ADP-ribose)polymerases (PARPs) that can sense single- and double-stranded DNA breaks. Our recent data established that PARP1 is activated at dysfunctional telomeres, raising the question of how this powerful and potentially dangerous enzyme activity is normally repressed at functional telomeres. These experiments are designed to reveal the fundamental principles of telomere function in human and mouse cells with the objective to understand how loss of telomere function affects human health and aging diseases."
"9540730","The secretion of progesterone is a primary function of the corpus luteum (CL) and a prerequisite for normal maintenance of pregnancy in all mammals. The coordinated differentiation of granulosa cells (GC) and theca cells (TC) into a functional CL is required for fertility. The single most important factor involved in regulating the secretion of progesterone in the CL, irrespective of species, is luteinizing hormone (LH). This pituitary gonadotropin induces luteinization of GC and TC, formation of the CL, and is capable of extending the functional life span of the CL. Secretion of progesterone is absolutely required for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy and inadequate progesterone secretion contributes to early pregnancy loss in women and cattle, the two model systems employed in this project. Despite substantial scientific progress achieved in understanding the initial events leading to the differentiation of granulosa cells, little is known about the differentiation of theca cells into functional luteal cells. This incomplete knowledge interferes with the development of novel therapeutic interventions to enhance CL function (steroidogenesis), provide contraception, and ultimately to control fertility. Recent developments in other fields of research have shed light on the composition and role of intracellular lipid droplets as dynamic contributors to metabolic events and disease states. These understudied organelles are prominent components of steroidogenic cells but almost nothing is known about their role in the ovary. Despite their differences, both GC and TC accumulate lipid droplets (LD) during CL formation, presumptively for storage of the steroid precursor, cholesterol, and cellular energy in the form of fatty acids. The composition and precise function of LDs likely differs between these two cells because of their unique origins and functions. There is a gap in our knowledge of the formation, composition, and function of LDs in ovarian steroidogenic cells. This proposal will test the hypothesis that LDs provide a metabolic or hormone-sensitive organelle which can provide cellular energy and/or store and mobilize substrate for progesterone synthesis. We will employ state-of-the-art lipidomic, metabolomics and proteomic analysis to examine LDs and metabolic events driven by LH in differentiating bovine granulosa cells and theca cells and human granulosa-luteal cells. Experiments will determine the role of protein kinase A (PKA) and adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) in controlling cellular metabolic activities that either enhance or inhibit progesterone synthesis. Our long-term objectives are to fully understand the cellular mechanisms of action of gonadotropins and the regulation of steroidogenesis. The short-term goals of this research are to discover new signaling events initiated by LH and to determine how these novel mechanisms contribute to innovative strategies for enhancing progesterone synthesis, fertility, and contraception."
"9541860","Project Summary A major problem in treating drug abuse is persistent vulnerability to relapse, even after long periods of abstinence. In the incubation of cocaine craving model of relapse, rats undergo extended access to cocaine self- administration. During withdrawal, rats exhibit a progressive intensification (incubation) of cue-induced cocaine craving. We have shown that calcium (Ca2+)-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPAR), comprised exclusively of the GluA1 subunit, accumulate in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) during late withdrawal and thereafter are required for the expression of incubated cue-induced craving. Therefore, understanding mechanisms regulating CP-AMPAR accumulation and maintenance may yield novel therapeutic targets for reducing craving and prolonging abstinence. Work from our lab and others have shown that cocaine withdrawal is associated with multiple adaptations that predict reduced Ca2+ levels in NAc medium spiny neurons (MSN). However, little is known about mechanisms that may link this reduced activity during withdrawal to the subsequent insertion of CP-AMPARs. One promising candidate involves the retinoic acid (RA) signaling cascade. Studies in hippocampal neurons have demonstrated that Ca2+ levels associated with basal synaptic transmission are sufficient to suppress RA synthesis. However, following a period of inactivity, RA synthesis is disinhibited, leading to increased translation of GluA1 and synaptic insertion of homomeric GluA1 CP-AMPARs. CP-AMPAR accumulation in the NAc during incubation may likewise involve reduced activity and has been demonstrated in our unpublished studies to be associated with increased translation of GluA1. Based on these similarities to RA- induced synaptic scaling, my central hypothesis is that cocaine incubation leads to a decrease in activity in NAc neurons at baseline, increased RA synthesis, and scaling up of CP-AMPARs. Aim 1 will determine if Ca2+ levels are altered in the NAc core during incubation of cocaine craving. I will use fiber photometry to measure changes in intracellular Ca2+, a correlate of neural activity, in early and late withdrawal from extended access to cocaine (or saline) self-administration. I will measure Ca2+ at baseline and during exposure to a cocaine-associated cue. Aim 2 will determine whether RA contributes to CP-AMPAR accumulation in NAc core MSN of cocaine incubated rats. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings in brain slices from cocaine incubated or saline rats will be used to determine if pharmacological manipulation of RA signaling alters AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in NAc medium spiny neurons. Aim 3 will determine if RA mediates synaptic scaling in cultured NAc MSN. I will use a RA reporter system to confirm that RA expression in MSN is activity- dependent, and pharmacological methods to determine whether RA-dependent scaling of CP-AMPAR occurs in NAc neurons. While these studies are underway, I will participate in a multi-faceted training plan to develop the non-bench skills needed to reach my goal of becoming a PI in an academic setting."
"9519784","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2014, approximately 5.2 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease (AD). With the aging of our society, the US percentage of persons age 65 and older with AD is expected to grow 40% to 7.1 million by 2025. Larger increases are expected in Arizona (67.7%) and Nevada (73%), the two states targeted in the proposed project, with only Alaska estimated to have a greater increase. Estimates expand substantially when combining AD with other related dementias (ADRD). The majority of people in the US with ADRD are non- Hispanic whites (NHW); however, within racial/ethnic group, Hispanics/Latinos and African Americans are more likely to be living with ADRD. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of ethnic/racial differences in dementia treatment, care, and research found consistent evidence that minority groups, particularly Hispanics/ Latinos, accessed dementia diagnostic services later than their NHW counterparts. The 2013 National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease states that identifying AD in its early stages creates advantages for early-stage people (EPs) and their care partners (CPs): for example, EPs can participate fully in legal, financial, and care decision-making; and social support can be mobilized for current and future concerns. Still, the point of diagnosis can start a cascading stress process that can negatively impact EP and CP health and emotional well-being, reinforcing the CDC's recognition of family caregiving as a national public health priority. While an emphasis on early detection and treatment in science and healthcare is growing, there is not corresponding emphasis on psychosocial interventions to address the well-being of early-stage dyads. Research to date has key limitations, including few RCTs, a focus on well-educated NHWs, limited treatment fidelity protocols, small sample sizes, and little impact on both EPs and CPs. This project addresses key limitations of previous studies by conducting an RCT with EPIC (Early-stage Partners in Care), an early-stage, group dyadic intervention, already offered in a pilot in diverse Arizona communities through community-based organizations that yielded positive EP and CP outcomes related to health and well-being. The proposed RCT, EPIC II, will expand EPIC across two states with an even more diverse sample and include maintenance of gains assessments. EPIC is an interdisciplinary collaboration of well-established community partners, a promotora network, and nationally recognized experts in AD caregiving and caregiving intervention research, implementation, and translation. Its innovation lies in a unique combination of skills training and care planning that helps EPs articulate their care values and preferences and become active decision makers with their CPs to achieve positive outcomes. EPIC builds upon a) the success of the EPIC I pilot, b) work with early-stage dyads showing EPs can respond validly and reliably about their care values and care preferences, c) intervention components in successful clinical trials (e.g., REACH, REACH II) with diverse groups of later-stage AD caregivers, and d) its group-based focus."
"9600392","Detection of intracellular RNA or DNA triggers unique sensors to activate the antiviral response: viral RNA activates the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)-MAVS pathway, and foreign DNA activates the cGAS-STING pathway. These two antiviral pathways activate the type I interferon (IFN) response, which is essential for host defense against virus infection. However, chronic, dysregulated production of type I IFNs underlies a number of human autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS). Study of AGS in particular has revealed how cells carefully control endogenous nucleic acid metabolism to prevent aberrant activation of either the RLR-MAVS pathway or the cGAS-STING pathway. Whether additional, uncharacterized pathways exist that are also important for preventing inappropriate type I IFN production remains unknown. We have found that disruption of any of the components of the SUMOylation pathway results in a dramatic, spontaneous activation of the IFN response. We have discovered that SUMO-2 and SUMO-3, but not SUMO-1, are redundant for this IFN regulation, revealing a previously unknown and specific function of SUMO-2/3. Remarkably, this IFN response is independent of all known nucleic acid sensing pathways, revealing a novel mechanism that does not fit into the current paradigm of IFN response regulation. SUMO proteins are conjugated to target proteins in a manner that is analogous to ubiquitination, but our understanding of the functional outcomes of protein SUMOylation lags behind that of the ubiquitination system. In this grant, we will identify novel SUMO-2/3-modified proteins, test their role in regulation of the IFN response, and define the chromatin landscape of SUMO-2/3 binding. Together, our studies will provide the first detailed map of SUMO-2/3 regulation of the IFN response, with implications for human diseases caused by dysregulated IFN production."
"9477505","TITLE  Project 2: Dissection of clonal architecture and evolution in solid tumors  ABSTRACT   Increasing evidence in solid tumors suggests that drug resistance and therapeutic failure results from  natural selection of resistant subclones during the disease course. Intra-tumor heterogeneity and cancer  subclonal diversity is the key driving force of the high failure rate of oncology drugs relative to other medical  specialties where drugs are applied to stable somatic genomes rather than the unstable genomes found in  human cancer. In this proposal, we focus on one of the most incurable and genetically heterogeneous tumors  (human glioblastoma), to predict and validate the landscape of driver alterations that mark initiation, founder  evolution, and therapy adaptation within individual patients. We will develop and apply novel technologies for  high-throughput transcription and genomic analysis of individual cells within malignant glioma tissues. Our  current system is capable of single cell mRNA capture, cDNA barcoding, and on-chip amplification, generating  amplicons for direct conversion into a standard, pooled sequencing library. We will adapt the same device for  massively parallel, on-chip capture of genomic DNA from individual cells for whole genome amplification and  exome capture. Next, we will functionally validate the single-cell glioma models in orthotopic mouse and  human systems in vitro and in vivo. The successful outcome of this proposal will be to deliver an integrated  computational-experimental pipeline that will be able to predict the forthcoming evolutionary moves of any solid  tumor in the presence of a defined set of selective pressures. This information will be of invaluable significance  to decipher evolving tumor dependencies and provide the most accurate therapeutic predictions."

"9595942","Program Summary Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability. As the population ages, the incidence of stroke is increasing. Improvements in acute stroke care mean that the death rate from stroke is declining. Stroke has thus changed into a disease of chronically disabled survivors. There is no medical therapy that promotes recovery in stroke. This proposal develops a stem cell therapy for a common subtype of stroke, subcortical or ?white matter? stroke. White matter stroke occurs in the regions of the brain that carry connections, is the most age-associated in its incidence, and is the second leading cause of dementia (termed vascular dementia). The proposed studies characterize the molecular and cellular process in tissue integration and wound healing of an hiPSC-derived cell in brain repair after white matter stroke. This cell is differentiated from an induced human pluripotent cell (hiPSC cell) into an immature glial cell, and is termed an hiPSC-glia enriched progenitor (hiPSC-GEP). Preliminary studies indicate that transplantation of hiPSC-GEPs into a mouse model of white matter stroke enhances behavioral recovery compared to other hiPSC types, and that this behavioral recovery effect is associated with improvement in the MRI appearance of white matter stroke. The studies in this grant will fully determine the phenotype and tissue integration of hiPS-GEPs, the transcriptional profile of hiPSC-GEPs and the cells of the surrounding stroke environment as these two populations re-organize and inter-relate over time after stroke, the effect of hiPSC-GEPs on stroke using in vivo MRI to track tissue repair, and the efficacy of hiPSC-GEPs in translationally relevant stroke conditions, such as in the aging brain. These studies use an innovative platform that includes a new mouse model, in vivo MRI, Drop-seq single cell transcriptional profiling, and viral reporter and gain and loss of function approaches. The proposed studies bring together a neuroscientist/neurologist and stem cell biologist to develop a novel therapy in a disease with increasing prevalence and no current therapy."

"9697468","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Child maltreatment (CM) constitutes a serious public health problem in the United States1 and is known to compromise children's developing self-regulation skills and amplify risk for substance use and other regulatory disorders. Parents are implicated in more than 80% of CM cases involving physical abuse and neglect and thus represent critical targets of intervention. Research on the physiological response of CM parents during parenting suggests that parenting interventions may be less effective with this population2 because they fail to affect the neurobehavioral markers of dysregulation that drive harsh, aversive parenting. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), an intensive, 20-session parenting intervention, has been shown to improve the quality of CM parenting, improve positive parenting and child behavior, and produce declines in CM recidivism,3,4 though the mechanisms underlying its effects are little understood. On the basis of its live- coached, moment-by-moment scaffolding of positive parenting, we theorize that PCIT builds regulatory strength in parents, which then supports lasting behavior change. Use of bug-in-the-ear technology-unique to PCIT-provides parents with immediate access to therapist reinforcements for positive parenting that work to counter parents' heightened physiological arousal, inhibit (prepotent) aversive responding, and support greater use of (nondominant) positive parenting behavior. This study is designed to extend the collective work of our investigative team. It uses an experimental intervention design as a vehicle for testing a causal model of change in neurobehavioral indices of self-regulation. Specifically, we propose to conduct a randomized, controlled trial of PCIT for CM and test the effects of PCIT on self-regulation and behavior in CM parents and their elementary-school children. Two hundred-fifty (250) maltreating mothers and their children (age 5-8 years) will be drawn from Child Protective Services and randomized to the PCIT intervention or a control condition (services as usual). Key contextual risk factors will be assessed, including cumulative risk, parent mental health, and parent substance use. A multirater, multimethod approach to assessment will include neural (EEG/ERP), physiological (ECG), behavioral, and self-report measures of self-regulation in CM mothers and their children, as well as standard measures of parenting skills and children's behavior outcomes. Families will be followed at 6 months for self-regulation, parenting, and child behavioral outcomes, and to 1 year for CM recidivism. Findings from this proposed study are expected to have significant implications for optimizing CM parenting interventions by (a) determining the sensitivity of CM parent and child neurobehavioral self-regulation systems to intervention, and (b) identifying individual differences in self-regulation that mediate and moderate response to intervention and long-term maintenance of gains."
"9468254","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The importance of dietary retinol (vitamin A) and retinoid signaling for normal development and differentiation in the testis has been recognized for many years. Signaling is effected in part through the retinoic acid receptors (RARs), of which there are three isoforms, ?, ß, and ?. We and others have shown the importance of signaling via the RAR? receptor in particular during spermatogenesis by gene targeting: mice deficient in RAR? (Rara-/-) are viable but the males are sterile, exhibiting defects in the seminiferous epithelium resembling those seen VAD diet. We have also shown that mice treated with an orally bioavailable pan-RAR antagonist become sterile, with similar testicular abnormalities. We have further shown that this induced sterility is reversible even with daily treatments for as long as 4 months upon cessation of drug treatment. Importantly, no detectable side effects were observed at these low doses and normal progeny were sired by fathers after restoration of fertility. This suggested that RAR-antagonists have potential as novel, non-steroidal compounds for male contraception. We propose to pursue this potential as outlined in the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Given the successful use of the pan-RAR antagonist compound 9 to induce male sterility and the recognition that it is RAR? that is critical for regulating spermatogenesis, we propose to test RAR?-selective antagonists that are immediately available and are being developed by our medicinal chemist collaborators in inhibiting spermatogenesis. Specific Aim 2. RAR? functions as a transcription factor, activating or repressing downstream target genes and antagonists function to block this transcriptional regulation. We therefore propose that such downstream target genes may themselves represent targets for interfering with spermatogenesis and inducing sterility, particularly if they are either testis-specific or function in a testisspecific manner. As spermiation appears to be a cellular process that is exquisitely sensitive to modulation of retinoid signaling, we will therefore focus on elucidating the mechanisms responsible for the improper anchorage of spermatids relative to the basal compartment, failure to translocate from basal compartment to the tubular lumen, and failure to disengage for spermiation, etc. at the cellular and molecular levels. These experiments will involve examining the expression of candidate genes known to be important in these processes and the identification of new genes by state-of-the-art RNA-Seq analysis. Specific Aim 3. To pursue RAR-antagonists ultimately as contraceptives in men, we propose to undertake a small scale trial in a non-human primate model (the common marmoset). The goal is to set the stage for future pre-clinical trials by examining the efficacy of antagonists with regard to induction of sterility and restoration of fertility. These studies will be done in collaboration with scientistsat the Southwest National Primate Research Center in San Antonio. Our prediction is that the pan-antagonist compound 9 will inhibit spermatogenesis in a reversible manner at doses that will not induce undesirable side effects."
"9493627","Project Summary/Abstract  Several researchers in the Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease (GRHD) at Cleveland State University are applying for funds to acquire an advanced imaging system (Amersham Typhoon 5) for imaging fluorescently labeled samples and for phosphorimaging to support their daily research activities pertaining to NIH-funded projects.  These scientists focus on research to improve understanding of biological processes and how malfunction of these processes results in various diseases. This research has significant potential to improve our understanding of the mechanisms and specific molecules that control reproductive health and those that control the aging process as well as implications for the diagnosis and treatment of many of the most common diseases found around the world, including heart disease, neurological disease, infectious disease, and cancer. These scientists aim to enhance and integrate research focused on gene regulation in health and disease, leading to better understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling these processes and the identification of therapeutic targets.  Although these scientists work in various disciplines and with different systems, a common theme for most research activities performed in their labs is to measure various changes in cellular macromolecules (DNA, RNA, and proteins) such as the amount of macromolecules, the activity of enzymes, the modification of these macromolecules during development/aging or under diseased conditions. To achieve these goals, the researchers seek to purchase an Amersham Typhoon 5 that has the specifications required for the top-notch experiments described in this application. The equipment will be located in the Dept. of Biological, Geological, and Environmental Sciences, while most of these researchers are located in the same hallway on the second floor of the Science Research building of CSU. Only one semi-functional Typhoon 9410 scanner is currently available to these researchers. Since Typhoon 9410 is obsolete and no longer supported by its original vendor, GE Healthcare due to lack of replacement parts, the frequent breakdowns of the current unit have already affected working efficiencies of these scientists. Therefore, acquisition of an advanced Amersham Typhoon 5 unit to replace the existing Typhoon 9410 is crucial for these researchers to achieve their goals smoothly in various NIH-funded projects."
"9567455","Overall Project Summary: Aging-associated cognitive decline, whether mild or severe, can profoundly affect the independence, well-being, and quality of life of those aged 65 and older. Development of effective interventions and treatments for this requires standard, psychometrically sound, easy-to-use measures that are sensitive to early indicators of cognitive decline and also capture non-cognitive factors associated with or predictive of cognitive changes. ?Advancing Reliable Measurement in Alzheimer's Disease and cognitive Aging? (ARMADA) proposes to meet this need by validating and expanding the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function® (NIHTB) for use in studies of cognitive aging beginning with normal cognition through progression into mild cognitive impairment and into early stages of Alzheimer's dementia. The NIHTB, developed with NIH support, provides a multidimensional, state-of-the-art set of measurement tools (available in English and Spanish) assessing key aspects of cognitive, sensory, motor, and emotional function and validated and normed in the general population for ages 3-85 years. To ensure that the NIHTB will be a valuable resource for cognitive aging research we will: 1) Validate English and Spanish versions of an expanded NIHTB (the NIHTB+) in existing, well-characterized, ethnically and racially diverse samples of adults ages 65-85 representing the trajectory of cognitive aging and in cognitively normal individuals 86+ years of age. 2) Expand the NIHTB by adding innovative instruments to assess neurological functions associated with cognitive aging; and 3) Facilitate use of the NIHTB+ in aging research by ensuring it is a readily available resource with robust user support. In order to accomplish these aims, we will form a consortium with the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and with researchers in cognitive aging and dementia from Alzheimer's Disease Centers and other clinical sites with existing cohorts. The consortium will be supported by Administrative, Technical, and Data and Statistical Analysis Cores."
"9435627","Abstract It is estimated that worldwide, 90% of the adult population are infected with one or more of the human herpesviruses. These viruses are responsible for lifelong debilitating and congenital infections, and some members of this family are associated with human cancers and age-related cognitive decline. Herpes simplex virus (HSV1) has infected more than 3.7 billion people under the age of 50 (67% of the population), and HSV1 and HSV2 and encephalitis) cause significant disease during acute infection (oral and genital lesions, corneal blindness establishing persistent latent infections in sensory neurons for the life of the host with the potential for reactivation and recurrent disease. Human and other vertebrate hosts have evolved a variety of strategies to sense, evade and defend themselves against viral infections, including the deployment of intrinsic antiviral restriction factors. The subject of this proposal is the intrinsic antiviral promeylocytic leukemia protein (PML) (also known as TRIM 19), an interferon-inducible RING finger SUMO ligase that has been implicated many cellular processes including protecting cells from cancer and microbial infections. During HSV infection, PML is recruited to viral genomes, triggering the formation of virally-induced nuclear bodies (viPML-NBs) that are associated with repression of viral gene expression. Surprisingly, the signal that triggers the formation of viPML-NBs has never been identified, and this represents a large gap in our knowledge of the mechanism of action of this important intrinsic restriction factor. Recent reports suggest that PML is sensitive to oxidation and forms multimers in response to oxidative stress. The formation of stress induced PML-NBs (siPML-NBs) is triggered in response to oxidation, which in turn causes the formation of covalent disulfide bonds in PML. Several enveloped viruses including HSV have been shown to increase the oxidation state of infected cells. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that multimerization of PML and formation viPML-NBs is dependent on oxidation induced by HSV infection. Furthermore, we suggest that cysteine residues in PML are required for the formation of viPML-NBs via disulfide bond formation. In Aim 1 we will determine the mechanism of multimerization of PML by expressing individual domains alone and in combination and testing the effect of redox on their structure, solubility, integrity and multimerization state. We have constructed a 3D model of the PML homodimer and have predicted surface exposed cysteines on PML that may play a role in multimerization. These predictions will be tested by genetic and biochemical experiments. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that the formation of viPML-NBs is dependent on oxidation induced by HSV infection and will test whether mutations in cysteine residues are defective in PML multimerization and viPML-NB formation.  "
"9529979","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), is the most common dominantly inherited ataxia in the world and caused by an expansion of a polyglutamine-coding CAG repeat in the ATXN3 gene. There currently is no effective treatment for this relentlessly progressive and fatal disease. Because expression of the mutant protein is an early and necessary step in disease pathogenesis, strategies to reduce expression of the disease gene itself are high on the list of potential therapies. Our previous therapeutic studies suggested the need for broad CNS delivery of gene silencing reagents. Chemically modified ASOs can be delivered broadly to the CNS and are known to be highly stable in vivo. Prior studies employing ASOs have documented well-tolerated, long-term knockdown in mouse and non-human primate models of neurodegenerative diseases including SMA, HD and ALS. Moreover, ASO therapy in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) was recently FDA- and EMA-approved following multiple highly successful human clinical trials. We recently established ASO therapy proof-of-concept in a SCA3 mouse model, concluding that the strategy to reduce levels of the nonessential ATXN3 disease protein in patients would likely be well tolerated. This U01 discovery proposal extends from the proof-of-concept studies to characterize a final human candidate lead ASO compound for IND-enabling studies. Aim 1 will confirm the viability of 4-6 lead ATXN3 ASOs through in vitro screens for inflammatory and off-target effects and in vivo tolerability in rodent and non-human primates that will support IND-enabling studies. Aim 2 will assess the in vivo efficacy of the lead ATXN3 ASOs to suppress mutant ATXN3 expression and ameliorate behavioral deficits, alter disease pathology and molecular signatures in a SCA3 mouse model expressing the full-length human mutant ATXN3 transcript. The results will culminate in the selection of a single lead compound for future IND-enabling studies. Concurrent with these studies, a necessary next step for therapeutic success is the optimization of SCA3 disease biomarkers that may directly assess therapeutic target engagement and treatment response. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is an ideal biological sample in which to look for therapeutic biomarkers as it is readily accessible and can be sampled repeatedly throughout disease progression and therapeutic trials. Significant advances in immunoassay technology now make it possible to quantify low abundance proteins using an ultrasensitive single molecule counting (SMC) immunoassay detection system. In Aim 3, we will optimize a SMC immunoassay to detect ATXN3 protein levels from SCA3 patient CSF samples. Developing this novel ATXN3 SMC immunoassay will enable detection of in vivo therapeutic target engagement and efficacy during ASO treatment in SCA3 patients."
"9624889","PROJECT SUMMARY While current Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) vaccine development has primarily focused on CD4+ and MHC Ia-restricted CD8+ T cell responses, increasing evidence shows that non-conventional CD8+ T cells restricted by MHC Ib molecules can recognize diverse microbial antigens and contribute to protection against Mtb infection. For example, H2-M3, Qa-1/HLA-E, Qa-2/HLA-G, MR1, and CD1 have been implicated in the host immune response against Mtb in mice and/or humans. However, most of these studies have only examined the function of MHC Ib-restricted T cells during the primary response to Mtb infection. Given that several subsets of MHC Ib- restricted T cells exhibit innate-like T cell characteristics and undergo unique thymic selection, it is unclear whether and which MHC Ib-restricted CD8+ T cell population can mount a memory response during Mtb infection. Furthermore, some MHC Ib molecules also act as regulators of the immune responses aside from their role in antigen presentation. In particular, Qa-1 can regulate immune responses against Mtb through the interaction with inhibitory CD94/NKG2A receptors and regulatory CD8+ T cells. To better understand the diverse role of MHC Ib molecules play in immune responses against Mtb, this proposal seeks to determine whether the composition and function of MHC Ib-restricted CD8+ T cell subsets in the secondary response differs from the primary response, as well as how individual Qa-1-mediated regulatory mechanisms contribute to the immune response against Mtb. In Aim 1, we propose to compare the kinetics, function, and protective ability of MHC Ib- restricted CD8+ T cell responses during primary and secondary Mtb infection in mice, and evaluate the protective efficacy of vaccination with Qa-1/HLA-E-restricted Mtb peptides. We will use a novel vaccination and re- challenge model that allows for complete clearance of an attenuated Mtb strain prior to challenge with fully virulent Mtb to study memory responses. These studies will allow us to identify the dominant MHC Ib-restricted CD8+ T cells and the Mtb antigens they present during the secondary immune response, their ability to mediate protective immunity against Mtb, and peptide vaccination strategies to increase the frequency of these effector CD8+ T cells. In Aim 2, we propose to investigate the mechanisms by which Qa-1 regulates immune responses during Mtb infection, with a focus on how inhibitory CD94/NKG2A receptors and suppressive Qa-1-restricted CD8+ Tregs individually contribute to the regulation of T cell responses during Mtb infection. To study these mechanisms, we will use mouse strains with genetic interruption of Qa-1?s interaction with individual receptors. These studies will allow us to identify how Qa-1 is able contribute to the balance between effector and regulatory immune responses for better protective immunity against Mtb. The combined results from our studies will yield a better understanding of how MHC Ib molecules and MHC Ib-restricted T cells contribute to the overall immune response against Mtb, for the development of better future vaccine strategies."
"9462018","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of a grant entitled Aging, Macrophage Mediators, and Burn Injury (R01 AG18859) which focuses on the mechanisms by which advanced age alters macrophage phenotype and function. The overall goal of the renewal application is to gain new knowledge about how the inflammatory milieu of aged mice is generated and how it predisposes the aged to aberrant pulmonary and systemic responses after traumatic injury. We know from clinical and experimental evidence that even in the absence of injury, healthy aged subjects have an elevated basal inflammatory state, referred to as inflamm-aging. Moreover, we believe that inflamm-aging is caused by the release of bacterial products from intestinal lumen and that the continuous exposure to these products, as well as low level of inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor ? (TNF?), interleukin-1? (IL-1?) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), causes a shift in alveolar macrophages to the M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype. A high level of M2 cells in the lungs would render the host unable to combat a pulmonary infectious challenge.  We recently reported that after a moderate size scale burn injury, aged mice have greater accumulation of neutrophils in the lung and more edema than their younger counterparts. New and exciting preliminary data reveal that after burn injury alveolar macrophages collected from young mice exhibit an M2 shift, presumably to help resolve inflammation. In contrast, after burn injury, alveolar macrophages from aged mice have a reduced M2 phenotype, which is markedly lower than that of cells obtained from sham injured aged mice. This reduction in M2 cells would allow lung inflammation to persist. From these pieces of evidence, we hypothesize that in the absence of injury alveolar macrophages from aged mice exhibit an M2 phenotype because of the continuous barrage of bacterial products which are elevated as a result of a breach in the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Moreover, the elevated intestinal damage seen in aged burn-injured mice exacerbates and prolongs post-burn pulmonary inflammation which, in turn, reduces lung function. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1, we will first determine if advanced age alters the M1/M2 polarization in the lungs of mice in the absence of injury. We will then go on to examine the impact of burn injury on macrophage phenotype. Next, in Aim 2, we will use adoptive transfer and macrophage specific knockout mice to investigate mechanisms by which advanced age alters alveolar macrophage function. In Aim 3, we will examine whether alterations in intestinal permeability after burn injury are more extensive in aged mice and account for the prolonged inflammatory response in the lungs. Finally, we will determine if restoring intestinal barrier integrity and wil reduce pulmonary inflammation and improve lung function. Taken together, these studies will expand on the limited knowledge of how advanced age alters alveolar macrophage function and whether therapeutic interventions targeting the lung and gut can be used therapeutically for the treatment of patients with burn and other critical illnesses."
"9595949","Project Summary/Abstract Two protein-based vaccines are licensed in the U.S. for prevention of meningococcal group B (MenB) disease in adolescents and young adults. One vaccine contains two Factor H binding protein (FHbp) Ags, one from each of the two phylogenic sub-families; the other contains one FHbp sub-family B Ag and three other potentially protective Ags. The former vaccine has limitations in protection against strains with no or low FHbp expression (10-20% of strains) and the latter has limitations against the ~40% of strains with FHbp in sub-family A and lacking another matched Ag. Our previous studies in human complement Factor H (FH) transgenic mice and infant rhesus macaques showed that binding of FH to FHbp decreases the magnitude of the protective Ab responses. Further, our colleagues have shown that human FH decreases the protective Ab responses to an alternative FH ligand known as Neisserial surface protein A (NspA), which is present in virtually all MenB strains. Since recruitment of the complement down-regulator FH to the bacterial surface contributes to immune evasion, a vaccine that targets both of these FH ligands would elicit Abs that effectively defeat this virulence mechanism. In Aim 1, we will incorporate FHbp amino acid substitutions to decrease binding of FH into optimally cross-protective FHbp sequence variants in each sub-family. In Aim 2, we will introduce substitutions to decrease binding of human FH to NspA based on the known crystal structure of NspA and to increase solubility of the recombinant protein using random mutagenesis and a fluorescent reporter system. For both Aims 1 and 2, we will test the optimized antigens for FH and MAb binding in vitro, evaluate immunogenicity in wild-type and human FH transgenic mice and test the serum Ab protective activity. In Aim 3, we will develop a combination FHbp-NspA vaccine that will combine an engineered FHbp sequence variant from each sub-family and an engineered NspA Ag. We will test the combination vaccine compared to a licensed MenB vaccine, first in human FH transgenic mice then in infant rhesus macaques with high binding of FH to wild-type FHbp and NspA. For each of these studies, we will determine the magnitudes of the bactericidal Ab responses against MenB strains that are specific for each of the two Ags (i.e. lacking or with very low expression of one of the two Ags). We also will test passive Ab protection in human FH transgenic infant rats. The data will support development of a second-generation MenB vaccine that elicits higher and more sustained protective Ab responses and broader protection than the currently licensed vaccines. Since binding of complement regulators is a common microbial virulence mechanism, the results also will have broad implications for the development of vaccines against other microbes that bind complement regulators or other host molecules."
"9493739","Abstract The broad and long-term objective of this application is to decipher lung airway function and progression of pulmonary vascular remodeling in unprecedented details using the newly available Notting Hill Devices (NHD) Preclinical Scanner. This patented Australian technology also known as 4-Dimensional X-ray Velocimetry (4DXV) is based on the wind tunnel technology known as particle image velocimetry. The penetrating nature of X-rays is used to capture a series of temporal phase-contrast images of the lungs. Velocimetry is used to determine the movement of an anatomical structure from one image to the next, providing information on both velocity and direction of movement. Images are paired and discretized into small sub-regions and cross- correlations performed between the sub-regions in consecutive images. The resulting 4-dimentional lung images provide functional airflow and pulmonary vasculature data of the lungs with detailed quantification of airflow and vasculature in specific regions of the airways, superimposed with high-resolution phase contrast enhanced CT. This 4DXV scanner provides a safe, quick, and inexpensive tool that provides detailed, regional quantification of lung function superimposed with lung structure. Hence, the scanner will enable a paradigm shift in lung research. The equipment will be utilized by a group of nine NIH-funded, established, senior pulmonary investigators organized in two active asthma Program Project Grants and three R01's in pulmonary arterial hypertension constituting the first application of this technology to conduct basic research in these two critical fields. The NHD Preclinical Scanner is an indispensable necessity for the asthma translational Program Project in which we propose to use this scanner to discover which specific area(s) of the lung novel classes of asthma drugs are acting. The scanner will be housed in a well-established program project Animal Model and Imaging Core. The Cleveland Clinic has made a strong commitment to establish an institutional Preclinical Lung and Heart Physiology Shared Laboratory to ensure long-term maintenance and operation of the instrument."
"9594249","Treatment of stroke is limited to only a few approved therapeutic options that have to be administered within rigid short timeframes resulting in the exclusion of many patients. The overarching goal of this proposal is to further our understanding of different microglia (Mg) and macrophage (MØ) phenotypes to drive the development of new personalized therapies for stroke. Activated Mg and MØ are the dominant inflammatory cells in stroke, peaking early and persisting into the chronic stage. These cells are highly dynamic and modulate both damage and repair. Human stroke trials using broad nonspecific anti-inflammatory therapies have failed, likely in part because human stroke is heterogeneous and reparative cells may have been inadvertently blocked in many patients. However, current knowledge on these cells and their functions had been derived mostly from in vitro assays that prevent longitudinal tracking in living animals and patients. How different Mg/MØ subtypes function in vivo, especially in response to interventions, is poorly understood. To enable in vivo investigations of Mg and MØ functions, we propose to thoroughly define the transcriptomes and proteomes and of Mg and MØ subsets in stroke to identify potential imaging targets for damaging and reparative Mg/MØ phenotypes. Oxidative stress and phagocytosis are two key functional manifestations of Mg/ MØ activity that can be manipulated for stroke therapy, and can be used to functionally differentiate between damaging and reparative Mg/MØ. Mg/MØ-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase damage after stroke, and are mostly produced by M1-type cells. Phagocytosis is important in repair, but can be seen in both M1- and M2-type Mg/MØ. Our previous transcriptome profiling identified myeloperoxidase (MPO) as a major product secreted by M1-type cells. MPO plays key roles in increasing oxidative stress and tissue damage after stroke, and remains elevated in the ischemic brain for weeks. Moreover, MPO can modulate the inflammatory response toward damage by interacting with the mannose receptor, though a key role of the mannose receptor is repair. Interestingly, mannose receptors are abundantly expressed on M2-type Mg and MØ, and can be increased by D-mannose administration even in M1-type cells. However, how D-mannose treatment will change Mg and MØ phenotypes in vivo in stroke is unknown. The proposed experiments will deepen our fundamental understanding of the functional diversity and plasticity of Mg and MØ in stroke, identify Mg/MØ based on their functional phenotypes, and lead to new imaging targets urgently needed for stroke. The specific aims are 1A) perform transcriptome-proteomics analysis to profile damaging and reparative Mg and MØ phenotypes and discover potential targets for these phenotypes, 1B) validate imaging agents to report on the phenotypes of Mg and MØ in stroke, 3) perform in vivo imaging to map damaging and reparative Mg and MØ activity after stroke, and 4) investigate changes in Mg and MØ phenotypes after D-mannose administration in stroke."
"9483597","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is projected to triple by 2050. To address this imminent public health concern, in 2011 the NIA-AA published revised diagnostic criteria for AD dementia and its anteceding stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These criteria allow providers to determine the likelihood that a patient's cognitive impairment is due to AD using biomarkers of cerebral amyloidosis (e.g. via Amyloid PET) and neurodegeneration (e.g. hippocampal atrophy via structural MRI). Recent tests of these criteria indicate that MCI patients who have biomarker evidence of neurodegeneration are likely to develop dementia, irrespective of amyloidosis. Thus, given the consequential impact of neurodegeneration on dementia onset, the proposed study seeks to address the need for complementary biomarkers of neurodegeneration that can provide specific topographical and neurobiological correlates of cognitive deficits in MCI. The Applicant proposes to develop white matter tract integrity (WMTI) biomarkers of neurodegeneration derived from the biophysical modeling of diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) parameters. Study participants will be composed of 80 clinically diagnosed MCI patients who will undergo a clinical evaluation, neuropsychological testing, MRI, and a 2-year follow-up clinical evaluation for diagnostic confirmation. The study aims to determine the extent WMTI metrics of axonal density and myelin integrity detect neurodegeneration throughout the brain beyond hippocampal atrophy, correlate with psychometrically sophisticated tests of memory, language, and executive functions, and complement other investigational MRI biomarkers of neurodegeneration (i.e. cortical atrophy, functional connectivity). The candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23), Dr. Benitez, is a clinical neuropsychologist whose career goal is to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of cognitive decline in aging and AD. The proposed K23 will extend her prior training in quantitative MRI of brain white matter compromise in cognitive aging during her institutional KL2 award. Specifically, she proposes didactic and applied training experiences to 1) become proficient in multi-modal MRI research to the level of an independent investigator, 2) acquire foundational knowledge on the neurobiology of aging/AD on which the interpretation of MRI findings is predicated, and 3) develop essential skills in the responsible conduct of clinical research in aging/AD, with the support of an outstanding mentoring team of senior researchers in MRI (Dr. Helpern), aging/AD neurobiology (Dr. Granholm), patient-oriented clinical research (Drs. Clark and Ovbiagele), and biostatistics (Dr. Nietert). By the end of the award, Dr. Benitez will have preliminary data for an R01 that will extend this project to a longitudinal study including Amyloid PET. This R01 will investigate WMTI metrics as clinical biomarkers of both neurodegeneration and amyloidosis, as recent preclinical findings suggest this may be possible with DKI but not diffusion tensor imaging. This work will address a multi-institute funding priority for biomarkers of cognitive decline across neurodegenerative diseases, for which no effective therapies exist."
"9540345","Project Summary  Drug development for the central nervous system is a significant challenge due in part to the blood- brain barrier limiting the distribution of therapeutics into the brain. The thyromimetic sobetirome is one example of a drug with limited distribution into the CNS. However, there is great interest in thyromimetics like sobetirome in treating demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) because thyroid hormone is known to stimulate differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into mature oligodendrocytes (OLs), the cells responsible for myelination in the CNS. Since the only clinical therapies for MS currently are immunomodulating in nature, the development of an agent that promotes myelin repair would represent a significant step forward in the field. While sobetirome itself primarily distributes to the peripheral tissues, a brain-selective prodrug of sobetirome could be designed to increase the brain exposure while concurrently limiting peripheral exposure. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop a novel prodrug strategy for directing sobetirome into the brain by targeting the brain-resident enzyme fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH).  In order to examine a FAAH-targeted prodrug strategy, this research begins with the synthesis of a novel library of amide prodrugs of sobetirome inspired by the known structure-activity relationship for FAAH substrates. The role of FAAH will be evaluated in kinetic studies of prodrug cleavage using overexpressed enzyme and the effect on thyroid receptor activation will be done in cell culture experiments. Tissue distribution studies with prodrugs and sobetirome will be done in WT and FAAH-KO mice to determine the role FAAH plays in enhancing brain selectivity. Preliminary studies have established that FAAH-targeted sobetirome amide prodrugs can improve the brain selectivity over the parent drug by nearly 100-fold."
"9563954","Project Summary (Abstract) This proposal explores the neural and psychological mechanisms that underlie older adult decision-making. Basic research in the cognitive neuroscience of aging has suggested that older adults show declines in the ability to control thoughts and actions based on internal goals, and that this may stem from age-related changes in the function of the lateral prefrontal cortex and mid-brain dopamine system. Yet currently, very little is known about whether and how these cognitive and neural changes associated with advancing age impact different forms of decision-making. The current proposal provides a novel perspective on this issue, by focusing on interactions between motivation and cognitive control. Decisions that are both high in motivational value but also heavy in cognitive demand are likely to be some of the most salient and impactful in every day life for older adults, including health choices (what to eat and drink; whether and how often to exercise; medications, treatments, and drugs to take), social interactions (who to approach and who to avoid, whether to pursue solitary or group activities), and financial decisions (what to purchase, how much to save, whether to gamble or purchase insurance) Yet currently almost nothing is known about how motivation ? cognitive control interactions change with advancing age or their impact on decision-making. The proposal relies on a recent theoretical framework, value-based cognitive control (VBCC), which postulates that motivational value serves to counteract the subjective and computational costs of engaging in cognitive control. A key implication of the VBCC framework is that age-related changes in decision-making should be most prominent under conditions that make the highest demands on motivation-cognition integration functions. The project directly tests this hypothesis, utilizing innovative and powerful new experimental paradigms and state- of-the-art neuroimaging methods to provide insight into the core neural mechanisms underlying age-related changes in decision-making. In Aim 1 the focus is on age differences in the control mechanisms that enable motivational integration, using a novel task in which the subjective motivational value of cognitive task performance varies as a function of both the monetary and liquid incentives available. In Aim 2, the focus is on age differences in the control mechanisms that enable delay-of-gratification, using a new task probing self-control in terms of repeated decisions to wait for a delayed reward, while foregoing an immediately available one. In both Aims, the central prediction is that older adults will show a reduced ability to successfully modulate cognitive control processes in lateral prefrontal cortex when this depends on integrating neural signals of current motivational value (arising from dopaminergic circuits involve the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum). This project will provide a necessary basic science foundation that has the potential to translate into a more comprehensive understanding of the key factors that impact older adult decision-making behaviors, and how to address and compensate for these when necessary."
"9526130","ABSTRACT Shubhabrata Mukherjee is a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Washington. He seeks a mentored career development award to obtain critical knowledge skills in Alzheimer's disease (AD) related biology of aging focusing particularly on sophisticated genetic models to analyze neuropathological outcomes and necessary research experience for an independent career as a multidisciplinary researcher. The training proposal details a five-year plan of formal and informal instruction in molecular and physiological aspect of AD. The plan includes mentored research by an established team of experts, coursework, seminars, and guided study in biology and neuropathology of aging and statistical genetics. The plan also includes experience in functional validation and exploration of molecular mechanisms of genes in animal models as well as collaborations in richly educational working groups. Dr. Mukherjee will have the opportunity to interact with colleagues at national meetings. Dr. Mukherjee's short-term career goals include 1) acquire a strong foundation of knowledge in the area of experimental aging as applied to neurodegenerative disorders, 2) receive training in the analysis and interpretation of experimental aging research data, 3) learn and apply novel ways of integrating genetic data followed by validation techniques in model organisms, 4) improve manuscript and grant writing skills, and 5) continue training in the responsible conduct of research. His long-term career goals are to be an independent multidisciplinary researcher with a diverse toolbox including sophisticated statistical methodologies and experimental approaches to understand and uncover pathophysiology of age- related neurodegenerative diseases. Genetic studies of AD have identified around 20 susceptibility loci in the past several years. The translation of this success to viable therapies and biomarker discovery depends on the identification and characterization of the actual disease genes and functional variants at these susceptibility loci. To overcome these major hurdles in the post-genome wide association studies era requires a multitude of alternative approaches including the use of neuropathological endophenotypes, which are biologically-relevant, and heritable phenotypes. The specific aims of the research proposed are to implement sophisticated gene-network analysis integrating prior biological knowledge properly to evaluate data from AD-related neuropathological endophenotypes and gain new insights. The most promising neuropathology-associated loci will be validated with animal models. Lastly, molecular mechanisms of these validated genes will be explored in C. elegans longevity models. Completion of the proposed aims will set the stage for subsequent independent funding to use network analysis approaches to further the scientific understanding of genetic and endophenotype data of AD, laying the groundwork for a new generation of AD therapeutics."
"9471717","Compared to traditional DSM personality disorder (PD) diagnostic categories, dimensional representations of PD provide a more comprehensive framework from which to understand and conceptualize maladaptive personality functioning (Clark, 2007; Widiger & Trull, 2007), consistent with the RDoC emphasis on dimensional models relative to traditional DSM syndromes. The five-factor model (FFM) of personality is widely regarded as the leading dimensional model of personality, and is supported by an extensive amount of empirical support spanning over 30 years. The FFM consists of 30 lower-order facet scales (as conceptualized by McCrae and Costa, 2003) from which both high and low levels can be used to describe PD. FFM descriptions of PD have been shown to account for the variance of all ten categorical DSM PD types (Livesley, 2001; Miller, 2012). In addition, personality science has demonstrated that normal range domains and facets of the FFM significantly predict disease and mortality (Dixon-Gordon, Whalen, Layden, & Chapman, 2015; Friedman & Kern, 2014; Smith & Mackenzie, 2006). However, symptoms of personality disorder have even larger associations with health outcomes (Gleason, Weinstein, Balsis, & Oltmanns, 2014). Recently, FFM- based dimensional measures of PD have been developed (Widiger, Lynam, Miller, & Oltmanns, 2012), providing an exciting opportunity to measure PD within the comprehensive framework of the FFM. The present line of research will incorporate this novel analytic and conceptual approach into an ongoing longitudinal study of a representative sample of 1,630 older adults in the St. Louis area. FFM-PD measures of neuroticism, conscientiousness, and extraversion (the Five-Factor Borderline, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Avoidant Inventories, respectively), which are most frequently associated with health (Smith, Williams, & Segerstrom, 2015) will be employed. Structural Equation Modeling will be used to compare the predictive and incremental validity of FFM PD measures with and over DSM PD measures and normal personality measures in the longitudinal prediction of self- and informant-reported general health status, major disease (including cancer, diabetes, and lung and heart disease), biological markers of stress and inflammation (e.g., cortisol, interleukin- 6, tumor necrosis factor-?, and C reactive protein), and mortality. The dimensional FFM PD measurement perspective will provide incremental validity over traditional measures of PD and normal personality measures in the prediction of these both subjective and objective measures of health. Results will be imperative to developing a comprehensive framework for understanding the longitudinal relationship between maladaptive PD traits and risk of physical disease and mortality in older adults. This proposal will provide the PI with the opportunity to unite two cutting-edge personality research laboratories, while advancing knowledge about the relationship between personality and health, and developing research skills and clinical training that will facilitate the goal of conducting and disseminating personality research as an academic professor."
"9593263","Project Summary/Abstract Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) represents the most common viral infection acquired by the developing fetus. Although most infants infected in-utero do not suffer long term symptoms, approximately 10% can have long term sequelae. Central nervous system (CNS) damage is the singular cause of these long term sequelae. Prevention of CNS infection and disease is the target of current antiviral treatment and has been proposed as a goal of prophylactic vaccines. The pathogenesis of CNS disease in congenitally infected human infants remains undefined and to date studies in animal models of CNS infection by HCMV have provided little information secondary to significant limitations inherent in these models. We have recently developed a murine model of infection of the developing CNS with the related murine CMV that recapitulates many key characteristics of the human disease, including hearing loss that is common in infants with congenital CMV infections. Using this model we propose to define mechanisms of protective antibodies that limit CNS infection and disease. In addition, we will explore the use of engineered viruses that are attenuated in their capacity to cause CNS disease and establish persistent infection to induce protective antibody responses. We anticipate that these studies will identify strategies for development of targeted biologics such as antibodies and attenuated viruses that can provide immunologically mediated protection from CNS infection and damage that can follow congenital HCMV infection. Because of the relatedness between MCMV and HCMV, these strategies could be rapidly transitioned into development of similar biologics for human use."
"9479671","PROJECT SUMMARY At the national level, there has been significant interest in addressing U.S. health disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. Although there is growing evidence to suggest race/ethnic disparities in dementia exists in the U.S., much of the evidence of disparities is indirect or comes from geographically- localized studies that may not be generalizable to the experience of Americans as a whole. Furthermore, there is little evidence to indicate whether disparities are widening or shrinking over time. Thus, the aims of this proposal are to (1) describe race/ethnic disparities in the incidence of experiencing Alzheimer's disease and related dementia at the national level in the U.S. and examine the extent to which race/ethnic disparities in incidence have changed over time, and (2) describe race/ethnic disparities in over- or under-diagnosis of prevalent Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the medical setting at the national level in the U.S. and examine the extent to which race/ethnic disparities in under- or over-diagnosis have changed over time. To accomplish these aims, we will use data from the nationally representative U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS), and linked Medicare data. For Aim 1, we will build on previous work creating algorithms to predict dementia status from ADAMS using only HRS data (ADAMS participants are sampled from HRS) in order to create an improved algorithm with optimal validity across and within race/ethnic groups. We will then apply this algorithm to assign dementia status to each eligible HRS participant at each HRS interview. From this we will derive age-standardized estimates of dementia incidence in HRS by race/ethnic group (self-reported non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic) over two time periods, 1998-2004 and 2006-2012. For Aim 2, we will use Medicare claims data to determine whether each eligible HRS participant had a diagnosis of dementia prior to or within 1 year after each HRS interview. We will then estimate agreement between the Medicare-based and algorithmic dementia diagnosis assigned at each HRS interview from 1998 to 2012 within race/ethnic groups to quantify disparities and temporal trends in over- or under-diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. This contribution is expected to be significant as it will provide (i) national and historical benchmarks against which to compare current and future data on local race/ethnic disparities in both the incidence and over- or under- diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia; (ii) evidence summarizing temporal changes in race/ethnic disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia; (iii) improved algorithms for diagnosis of dementia in HRS that maximize validity in minority populations; and (iv) evidence for the feasibility of linking of multiple data sources to provide valid estimates of race/ethnic disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the U.S."
"9519777","OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION ? Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to understand the underappreciated and understudied deterioration in health among middle-aged American men and women, especially among white non-Hispanics. All-cause mortality rates for white non-Hispanics aged 45?54, after three decades of decline, have been rising since 1998. The increase has been driven by drug and alcohol poisonings (accidental and intent undetermined), by suicides, and by cirrhosis and chronic liver disease. If white non-Hispanic mortality rates had continued to decline at 1.8 percent a year after 1998?the average rate of decline for whites in the previous two decades?about 500,000 deaths would have been avoided through 2013, a number comparable to cumulative AIDS deaths in the US. There has been no corresponding change in the rate of mortality decline for non-Hispanic blacks or for Hispanics. In the same age group, morbidity among white non-Hispanics has increased for a range of measures, including self- reported physical and mental health, chronic pain, ability to conduct activities of daily living, including work, self-reports of heavy drinking, and clinically measured liver function. In contrast to the midlife group, mortality and morbidity have continued to improve for those aged 65 and above. The project will drill down into these overall statistics, disaggregating by location, by age, by educational group, and by race and ethnicity, as well as by making comparisons with other wealthy countries. It will also attempt to understand the reasons behind the decline in midlife health. There are six specific aims: (1) to document the geographical distribution of the additional midlife deaths across the US and to link mortality and morbidity patterns across space to spatial patterns of income, poverty, inequality, employment, unemployment, and education, (2) to compare mortality and morbidity patterns across rich countries, (3) to investigate the racial and ethnic dimensions of midlife mortality and morbidity change in the US, to try to understand why non-whites and Hispanics have been largely exempt, (4) to understand the concurrent steepening in mortality and morbidity education gradients, (5) to investigate the links between morbidity and mortality, and particularly the role of pain, which has been important in the prescription of opioids, and which is itself a risk factor for suicide, and (6) to investigate the hypothesis that long-term unfavorable economic changes for those currently in midlife, particularly those with low educational attainment, have played a role in precipitating increases in morbidity and mortality. The long-term aim of the project is to understand an important and unusual reversal in the normal progress of morbidity and mortality decline, and to be better able to predict whether it is a temporary phenomenon confined to this age group, or whether it is likely to spread into other age groups, particularly the elderly. Our methods are the standard ones of observational demography and economics. Much of the work is concerned with documenting patterns in official data and nationwide surveys, and using patterns across space, time, and groups to test a range of hypotheses, particularly the links between ill health and economic stress."
"9542517","PROJECT SUMMARY Research in several species shows that rapidly stopping action activates the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of the basal ganglia (BG) ? and that the STN may be recruited via a hyperdirect pathway (HDP) from prefrontal cortical stopping nodes. Human research also shows that unexpected events (such as a surprising tones) also recruit the stopping system (including the STN), and interrupt working memory (WM). At the core of this proposal is the idea that WM is maintained via a recurrent cortico-BG loop, and that this can be interrupted via HDP recruitment of the STN. The interruption is induced via stop signals and unexpected events, and could function to `clear cognition'. This is a radical new theory: that a fronto-BG circuit for stopping underlies cognitive interruptions. Validating this theory has broad implications for understanding the BG, for mechanisms of cognitive interruptions, and for potential cognitive under-and-over flexibility in Parkinson's disease (PD) and ADHD. Here we propose to systematically test this theory using parallel human-mouse studies, based on extensive preliminary data and using several novel approaches, including event-related Deep Brain Stimulation (eDBS). Aim 1 (motor stop) will use STN eDBS in humans and optogenetic stimulation in mice to test whether the STN is causally important for stopping action. Aim 2 (cognitive stop) will use eDBS and functional MRI in humans and optogenetics in mice to test whether the STN is causally important for decrementing WM. Aim 3 (HDP) will use combinatorial optogenetics in mice and novel combinations of transcranial magnetic stimulation with concurrent local field recordings in human STN to test whether motor and cognitive Stops are implemented via HDP inputs to STN from frontal cortex. Throughout the proposal we focus on designing complementary experiments across species, so that what is learned in mice can directly inform our understanding of human neural circuit function and behavior."

Each study participant was supported by a family member who also received program benefits; 70% of these supporters did not have diabetes. Compared to the control group, fewer non-diabetic supporters in the experimental group converted to diabetes by 12 months post study entry. The primary purpose of the proposed study is to test the effectiveness of our culturally tailored DSME intervention that will be adapted for preventing, or at least delaying, diabetes onset in Mexican Americans with prediabetes. The intervention will involve: 1) 12 2- hour weekly group educational sessions that emphasize eating and preparing healthy Mexican-American foods and increasing physical activity; 2) 15 2-hour bi-weekly/monthly support group sessions on problem solving the barriers to adopting healthier lifestyles; and 3) 3 booster sessions held at 6-month intervals. We will integrate aspects of the Diabetes Prevention Program, as well as motivational interviewing, and prior to intervention testing, we will conduct focus groups with key individuals in Starr County to confirm the strategy and obtain community support. Intervention effectiveness will be examined using a randomized, repeated measures, pretest/posttest control group design, with an ?enhanced? usual care control group. We will enroll 300 Mexican Americans with verified prediabetes from rosters of ongoing Starr County genetic studies. Groups of 10 will be constituted according to the area of the county in which people live; each group will be randomly assigned to experimental or control conditions. Growth curve analysis, using multilevel models, will be used to compare intervention effects on health outcomes over time. We hypothesize that participants in the experimental group, compared to the control group, will have better health outcomes (A1C, FBG, lipids, BP, physical activity, dietary intake, and anthropometric variables [BMI, waist circumference]) at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline, as well as lower rates of converting to T2DM (OGTT) by 36 months. This study is a significant step in our plan to develop effective culturally tailored health programs for populations at high risk for T2DM."
"9481714","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) interfere with mammalian hormones, and can cause myriad adverse health effects, including developmental effects, neurological effects, reproductive effects, and cancer. One way that EDCs cause disease is by causing epigenomic modifications that change how genes are regulated in specific cells and tissues. It is often not feasible to sample brain tissue in humans, but other tissues lik blood and skin can be readily sampled. This raises the question of whether epigenomic profiles associated with EDC exposure in blood and skin are good surrogates for exposure in brain. The proposed research will test this directly using mice and mouse cells exposed to 2, 3, 7, 8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, or dioxin). TCDD is an EDC that affects multiple tissue systems and has adverse neurodevelopmental effects. Mice will be exposed to TCDD during adolescence, a critical time for brain development. The project's objective is to understand how TCDD exposure alters epigenomic profiles in three specific brain regions (cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus), peripheral blood leukocytes, and skin. Comparing these samples will reveal robust epigenomic signatures of TCDD exposure. Importantly, the study will use the genetically diverse mouse Collaborative Cross reference population to better reflect human populations. Some individuals may be more susceptible to TCDD exposure than others, and this experimental design will capture that variation. In parallel, mouse primary cells will be exposed to TCDD in vitro to determine if cell-based systems can accurately reflect the epigenomic modifications seen in tissues. If so, cell-based systems will have many applications for research and for screening potentially hazardous chemicals. The results will be integrated with available public data sources to better understand how mouse epigenomic profiles can be used to predict TCDD effects in humans, and in other affected tissues in mouse and humans."
"9535028","Social relationships are critically important to residents of assisted living (AL), a form of care for older adults. For older adults in general, there is a strong association between positive social relationships and their health and subjective well-being. In AL, developing and sustaining close relationships with co-resident peers can help facilitate good physical and mental health functioning. Alternately, lack of social engagement can ultimately result in poor health, e.g., depression and heart disease. Further, recent studies on loneliness have determined that 29% to 50% of older adults are lonely, and this in itself can result in negative outcomes, such as an increased need for assistance with activities of daily living, decline in mobility, and a higher risk of death.  This proposed study addresses an important aspect of social relationships that is often ignored in AL, that of intimacy. Here we define intimacy as a tendency to spend time with a specific person or persons, to positively value that time, and to include the possibility of expressing social closeness through emotional investment and physical expression. Although research has shown that intimacy is tied to older adults? sense of independence, good cognitive functioning, expectations in life, and lower cancer and cardiovascular rates, AL settings infrequently actively promote or encourage social relationships among residents. This is especially true of residents? most intimate or personal companionate behaviors, showing affection and expressing sexual needs and a sexual identity. In previous research, we have found (a) residents? intimate needs to be sometimes ignored, overlooked, infantilized, ridiculed, and constrained by negative staff attitudes; (b) residents often viewed stereotypically by staff as asexual or non-companionate beings and as culturally sexually problematic; and (c) residents given little autonomy as to the expression of intimacy. This is despite research that has determined intimate, including sexual, activity in aging populations to be both normal and health protective, adding greatly to older adults? quality of life.  Our proposed research will focus on AL co-resident close physical, social, and emotional relationships from the points of view of AL frontline and management staff by examining (1) staffs? definitions and perceptions of resident intimacy; (2) the role and degree that Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias play in staffs? attending to resident expressions of intimacy; and (3) the way intimacy is addressed, permitted, and managed by staff on a day-to-day, case-by-case, basis to accommodate their own value systems as well as those of the residents and the setting. The focus on staff perceptions of intimacy is important given the power they hold in AL settings. In addition, we will explore barriers to expressions of intimacy so that meaningful social relationships among residents, especially those with dementia, can be promoted to improve residents? quality of life and well-being. We propose to spend 24 months conducting ethnography and interviewing frontline staff and managers in each of three diverse AL settings. Standard methods of qualitative data analysis will be used."
"9551481","Project Summary Abstract The primary objective of the current project is to improve and evaluate the efficacy of on-line brain plasticity- based computerized assessment tool and training program for the prevention and delay of the onset of Alzheimer?s disease (AD). This novel therapeutic strategy is designed 1) to increase feed-forward power in brain systems in ways that are designed to reactivate them, and 2) to directly exercise highest-level neurological (DN) processes. We will rapidly develop an enhanced PACR-AD 2.0 program with older adult specific website wrapper, video instructions and motivation videos, which will facilitate greater program engagement and adherence. Next, we will launch a large sample, two-site, double-blind RCT of the program with older adults. This RCT will be powered for clinically significant efficacy outcomes; in it, PACR-AD 2.0 will be compared to an active control of computer games that are matched for the multiple factors of challenge, computer time and research staff interaction during the intervention period. For the intervention trial, we have partnered with University of Iowa and University of Texas at Dallas. These sites will comprehensively evaluate immediate as well as sustained outcomes of the PACR-AD 2.0 vs. control intervention in cognitive, functional and, neurological measures. Successful evaluation of PACR-AD 2.0 will be used to obtain FDA clearance for the program and commercialize it as the first evidence-based prevention device indicated for age-related cognitive decline. Given the ease of access of online-based assessment and training, this project should result in the development of a new, powerful tool to assess and prevent the risk of onset of AD, and to provide effective adjunctive therapy that results in far greater resilience against cognitive impairment in a substantially greater pre-AD population."
"9529342","Empirical evidence accumulated over many decades revealed an apparent contradiction between the health and survival of men and women. Women enjoy a longer life than men in all countries of the world, but women tend to report poorer self-rated health, they have higher disability levels at all ages and perform more poorly on physical tests than men. This so-called male-female health-survival paradox has far-reaching economic, sociological, and medical implications for human societies. We have spent the past five years investigating the health-survival paradox using an exceptionally rich data resource of Danish register and survey data (Oksuzyan et al., 2008, 2009, 2010a, 2011, 2013; Jacobsen et al. 2008). Generally, we have not been able to confirm any major impact of many of the suggested underlying mechanisms such as male underreporting of health problems and medication use (Oksuzyan et al., 2009). We also performed cross- national comparisons with other high-income countries (Japan and US) and found consistent sex differentials in survival and health (Oksuzyan et al., 2010b). Finally, we extended our analyses to the Utah population and found that, despite high female fertility and a healthy male life style (low tobacco and alcohol consumption), females in Utah have very substantial survival advantages (Lindahl-Jacobsen et al., 2013).  In this renewal we intend to expand this research to test how universal are the sex differences in health and survival in populations that experience living conditions and cultures very different from contemporary Western societies (China and Russia). In these studies we will focus on the same theme as in the primate study, namely social status and how it contributes to male-female differences in health and survival and compare them to the rich data available in Denmark. Furthermore, we intend to use the comprehensive cause of death data available in Denmark and Utah to test how male-female differences in causes of death may contribute to the paradox. By focusing on the outstanding, already existing human data resources that were created in our previous P01 work and also used in project 1, and by making explicit cross-species comparisons between our study population and the primate population that will be examined in Project 3, we propose to shed new light on potential mechanisms underlying the male-female health-survival paradox."
"9512465","Project Summary?Membrane associated or soluble tissue factor (sTF) in complex with factor (F) VIIa activates FX to FXa and FIX to FIXa. In this process, the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain and the epidermal growth factor-like domain1 (EGF1) of FX and that of FIX play important roles in interactions with TF/FVIIa complex. This activation process is regulated by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), which consists of three Kunitz domains; the first domain (K1) binds to FVIIa and the second domain (K2) binds to FXa (but not to FIXa). Thus, formation of the quaternary TF:VIIa:Xa:TFPI inhibitory complex effectively shuts down the TF- induced FX activation. However, uninhibited TF/FVIIa continues to activate FIX for persistent coagulation. The molecular recognitions involved in the activation of FIX and FX by TF/FVIIa and in the formation of inhibitory complex (TF:VIIa:Xa:TFPI) are incompletely understood. Further, large discrepancies exist between the reported affinity values of sTF (but not for membrane TF) for zymogen FVII, FVIIa and active site inhibited- FVIIa. Our preliminary data indicate that the sTF affinity increases ~7-fold at each step during the conversion of zymogen FVII to FVIIa and to active site inhibited-FVIIa. Further, our NH2-Ile153-carbamylation data support that S1-subsite occupancy and sTF binding to FVIIa protease domain are thermodynamically linked. In Specific Aim 1, we propose to obtain crystal structures of the zymogen FVIIR152E, and two naturally occurring activated mutants (FVIIaR304Q and FVIIaR304W) each in complex with sTF. We will further biochemically characterize the unactivated as well as activated FVIIR304Q and FVIIR304W mutants. Such data should provide the structure of zymogen FVIIR152E and role of Arg304 in relaying the allosteric signal to the active site of FVIIa for enhanced activity upon TF binding. In Specific Aims 2 and 3, we propose crystallography and mutagenesis studies to delineate molecular interactions involved in binding of Gla and EGF1 domains of FXa and FIXa to TF/FVIIa, and in binding of FVIIa to the K1 domain and of FXa to the K2 domain of TFPI. We will use two- domain TFPI (TFPI161) that binds to FXa and to FVIIa. Wild-type FXa after binding to TFPI via its active site serine slowly cleaves TFPI. Thus we will use FXa in which its active site Ser195 is mutated to Ala (XaS195A). FXaS195A binds to TFPI very tightly. To understand interactions of Gla/EGF1 domains of FIXa with FVIIa/sTF, we will use a hybrid XaS195A in which its Gla and EGF1 domains are replaced from FIX, termed XaS195A-IXGE.  For the proposed studies, we have expressed and purified zymogen FVIIR152E, FVIIR304Q and FVIIR304W. We have also successfully purified the quaternary complexes of (XaS195A)-VIIa-sTF-TFPI161 and (XaS195A-IXGE)-VIIa- sTF-TFPI161 and obtained crystals of (XaS195A)-VIIa-sTF-TFPI161 that diffract to 3.5 Å but decay after few frames. Crystallization trials/structure determinations of quaternary complexes and mutational studies in the Gla/EGF1 domains of FX and FIX will be carried out simultaneously. The knowledge gained from the proposed studies could aid in the development of new generation of antithrombotics and antihemophilic agents."
"9496395","Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients."

In addition, capacity needs to be built for testing for  other  AES  pathogens  in  the  country.  In  addition,  good  laboratory  systems,  including standardized testing and reporting procedures, strong quality assurance programmes and and linkages with global specialized referral laboratories, need to be established to ensure quality and provide technical support to national laboratories in India.

"9591121","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a transcription factor that is activated following Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Genetic variants in IRF5 hav been robustly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptibility in both genome-wide and candidate gene association studies. While IRF5 is strongly and consistently associated with SLE, the mechanisms by which IRF5 predisposes to human SLE are still unclear. Our central hypothesis is that SLE-associated variants in IRF5 promote autoantibody formation and alter transcriptional patterns in human immune cells following TLR ligation, resulting in risk of SLE. We have previously shown that SLE-risk haplotypes of IRF5 are associated with autoantibody formation in both SLE patients and healthy autoantibody positive individuals. The HLA locus is strongly associated with SLE, and the MHC molecules encoded by this locus can direct the immune response against particular self-antigens. We propose that SLE-associated variants in MHC molecules present self-peptides derived from particular nuclear antigens, and then IRF5 variants cooperate in autoantibody production by enhancing activation of self-reactive B-cells directed against these antigens. In our preliminary data, we support this concept with evidence for a strong gene-gene interaction between IRF5 and HLA upon autoantibody formation in SLE patients (OR=3.42). IRF5 is a transcription factor, and it seems likely that risk variants should influence SLE risk by altering transcriptional profiles in immune cells. In preliminary data, we show that IRF5 risk variants result in differential binding to ISRE promoter elements in human cell lines. IRF5 translocation to the nucleus was greatly augmented in SLE patient monocytes, while little increased translocation was observed in NK and T cell lineages. These data support an important role for IRF5 variations in human monocytes. We have two Specific Aims: Aim 1: Define gene-gene interactions between HLA haplotypes and IRF5 genetic variants upon autoantibody traits in human populations. We will genotype 1500 SLE patients at the IRF5 and HLA loci to examine IRF5-HLA gene-gene interactions upon autoantibody traits. Additionally, we will study a unique cohort of individuals with SLE-associated autoantibodies who have a range of diagnoses, including asymptomatic people who are at risk of progression to SLE. Aim 2: Determine changes in transcriptional targeting of the IRF5 SLE-risk variants in monocytes and B cells from SLE patients, autoantibody positive asymptomatic subjects, and healthy controls. We will purify cells from the two lineages noted above from subjects homozygous for risk or protective haplotypes of IRF5. Cells will be stimulated with TLR7 or TLR9 ligands. ChIP-seq will be performed, and peaks will be compared between genotype categories and between patient groups. Our long-term goal is to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of human SLE, so that diagnostic and therapeutic approaches can be informed by the molecular biology of disease in a given individual. We will make progress toward this goal via the following expected outcomes: 1. Identify robust IRF5-HLA interactions that contribute to the break in tolerance to nuclear antigens observed in autoimmune disease and 2. Define transcriptional targets of IRF5 that are characteristic of the SLE-risk haplotypes and determine how these transcriptional patterns are associated with varying degrees and stages of autoimmunity in human populations (healthy, asymptomatic seropositive, and SLE)."

"9558343","Project Summary Up to 1.1 million Americans per year suffer from burn injuries that require medical care. The foundation of burn wound care is determining whether a patient has a deep burn that will require excision and skin grafting or a partial thickness burn that is expected to heal without surgery and without scarring. Accurate determination of burn wound depth is critical because over estimation results in unnecessary surgery and under estimation results in prolonged treatment, increased cost, increased scarring, disfigurement and loss of function. Clinical assessment is most commonly used to determine burn wound depth, but is not very reliable, and even with the most experienced surgeons is only accurate 76% of the time. A variety of imaging modalities have been used to try and estimate burn wound depth. The current gold standard is laser Doppler imaging (LDI), that correlates blood flow with burn wound depth. It has not been widely adopted in the US. Barriers include difficulty interpreting the images, and multiple variables that interfere with light based detection of blood flow including residual pigments from silver dressings or tattoos, and patient conditions that affect blood flow such as infection, edema and use of vasoactive medicines. We propose to detect burn-induced changes in the mechanical properties of the subcutaneous tissue using FDA approved tissue Doppler elastography imaging (TDI). The premise is that changes caused by burn injury that have propagated beyond the skin will change the stiffness of the subcutaneous tissue. Those changes can be detected by changes in color (red= soft, blue = hard) in the image. Using sound waves to detect tissue changes avoids the limitations of light based imaging technologies such as LDI. To promote adoption of this technology, Med Compliance IQ will develop a software platform called Burn IQ that uses neural networks to analyze the TDI images. It will provide clinical decision support by providing a probability that a burn injury is deep, i.e. requires excision and grafting, vs. partial thickness. Med Compliance IQ has partnered with a team at Ohio State University that established model of pig burn injury that has been characterized with TDI. For phase 1 of the SBIR proposal the pig model will be used for software planning and development by obtaining TDI images from known partial thickness burns, known full thickness burns and burns of indeterminate thickness. Initial testing and refinement of the software technology will also be done with human subject that also have known partial thickness, known full thickness and indeterminate depth burns based on healing outcomes. This information will be used to yield a software product ready for testing on a large scale in human subjects during Phase 2 of the SBIR. Development of this product will improve diagnostic accuracy to achieve better outcomes for burn patients."
"9505999","SUMMARY: Murine Mutagenesis Core In recent years neuroscience research has experienced many transformative technical advances. Mouse genetics is a major contributor to this technological revolution. NINDS-supported investigators at JHU SOM rely heavily on mutant and transgenic mouse lines to study the nervous system, both in health and disease. However, the generation of these transgenic mouse lines, which in many cases are tailor-made, expensive, and time-consuming to produce, requires extensive dedicated effort and equipment. Moreover, to achieve success using these transgenic technologies, users must have considerable technical knowledge. The goal of the Murine Mutagenesis Core (MMC) is to lower barriers for generating mouse mutants by providing a unique suite of mouse mutagenesis services for neuroscience investigators at JHU SOM. The MMC offers NINDS- supported investigators, and other scientists engaged in research consistent with the NINDS mission, access to state-of-the-art techniques, including: homologous recombination-mediated targeting in mouse ES cells, karyotyping of ES cells, cryopreservation of crucial mouse lines, and the use of targeted ES cells from commercial and noncommercial sources. Importantly, the highly experienced MMC personnel provide face-to- face advice on targeting construct design, the use of recombineering technology to make these constructs, project trouble-shooting as work progresses, and technical feedback which is lacking in cores outside of JHU. Owing to recent success by the MMC in employing CRISPR, ZFN, and integrase based mutagenesis and gene targeting, the MMC proposes expanding its services to utilize these non-ES cell based technologies that have significantly shortened the timeline for generating mutant mouse alleles and have reduced the cost for investigators compared with traditional homologous recombination approaches. The proposed new services (many of which are not commercially available) include: 1) CRISPR induced small deletion mutations; 2) CRISPR-introduced floxed conditional and epitope-tagged alleles; 3) generation of large insertions using the CRISPR approach; 4) CRISPR-induced additional mutations in existing transgenic lines; and 5) introduction of useful genes, such as those encoding various forms of GCaMPs and DREADDs, into the Rosa26 locus by integrase-based integration. Since there are many challenges in implementing the evolving CRISPR technologies, and since there is still value in using targeted ES cells from commercial sources, the MMC ES work will be maintained. Given its success and productivity during the past funding period, the MMC proposes continuing to provide Primary Center Investigators and other neuroscientists at JHU with the opportunity to generate innovative mouse lines to study basic mechanisms of nervous system function and the causes of neurologic diseases. In addition, the MMC proposes continuing to encourage collaboration among neuroscientists at JHU and facilitating the utilization of state-of-the-art techniques to accelerate advances in neuroscience research."
"9541746","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer in adults and the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide; while incidence and mortality rates are two times higher in Latinos, incidence rates are the highest among Latinos in the South Texas region. The genetic events associated with the increased incidence of HCC in this population are largely unknown. Identification of unique genetic markers, in combination with implementation of known risk factors in South Texas Latinos (i.e. obesity and fatty liver disease), could be instrumental for understanding the mechanisms driving the increased incidence, and for development of new treatment modalities. We performed whole genome RNA sequencing in paired HCC tumor and adjacent normal tissue total RNA from nine South Texas Latino patients. Analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed significant alterations in pathways associated with oxidative stress and mineral uptake; most importantly, we found that the expression of STEAP2 (Six Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 2) is increased five-fold in HCC tumor tissue compared to adjacent-normal tissue. In comparison to a non-Latino population, this finding was unique to South Texas Latinos. STEAP2 is a metalloreductase of iron and copper, the reduction process facilitates transfer of iron and copper into cells. Reduced iron and copper ions can mediate the production of hydroxyl radicals resulting in increased oxidative stress, which can cause DNA damage and lipid peroxidation. Interestingly, we found significantly higher levels of total copper and markers of oxidative stress in HCC tissue compared to adjacent normal liver tissue. In our studies, knockdown of STEAP2 expression in human HCC cell lines significantly inhibited cell viability, motility, and clonogenicity in soft agar, suggesting a malignant-promoting role in HCC. Given these findings, an immediate need exists to find the mechanistic links between STEAP2, iron and copper levels, oxidative stress and HCC development and progression. Therefore, we hypothesize that STEAP2 will lead to an increase in oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and cell growth in the hepatocytes resulting in enhanced tumorigenesis and tumor progression in HCC, especially in obese hosts. Two specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis. Aim 1. Determine the mechanisms by which STEAP2 acts as an oncogenic factor and a contributor to increased oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and labile iron and copper levels. Aim 2. Establish the effect of liver-specific STEAP2 overexpression on increased liver steatosis and tumorigenesis in combination with a high fat diet. The gene to be studied is a unique metalloreductase that may modulate the crosstalk between iron/copper levels, obesity, oxidative stress and HCC carcinogenesis. Verification of our hypothesis would indicate a possible role of STEAP2 as a novel therapeutic target for HCC in the Latino population and other cancer types as well. Our animal studies will reveal in vivo function of STEAP2 in combination with a high fat diet, and provide better mouse HCC models for studying HCC tumorigenesis and drug screening."
"9494032","PROJECT SUMMARY Simultaneous replication and transcription of the same DNA template (replication-transcription conflicts) appear to be common in eukaryotic cells. Although these conflicts have long been studied as a potential source of DNA damage and, therefore, a threat to genome integrity, we lack a detailed molecular understanding of how the presence of transcribing RNA polymerases on DNA affects the movement of the replication machinery (replisome), and of the mechanism(s) by which these replication-transcription conflicts can ultimately give rise to DNA damage. The long-term goal of this project is to characterize the nature and outcomes of eukaryotic replication-transcription conflicts at the molecular level. The proposed work uses a recently developed quantitative method to assay the movement of the replisome genome-wide at high resolution, in combination with genome-wide interrogation of DNA double-strand break formation. Previous research has indicated that tRNA genes, which are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (RNAP3), represent sites of abundant DNA damage and strong, polar barriers to replication ? i.e. a tRNA gene in the head-on orientation relative to replisome movement leads to terminal arrest of a significantly higher fraction of replisomes than a tRNA gene oriented co-directionally with replication. In contrast, genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) do not appear to induce significant replisome arrest but have previously been reported to be associated with DNA damage in an orientation-dependent fashion, especially in the context of impaired pre-mRNA processing. This study has two specific aims: (1) to determine the molecular basis of replisome arrest and DNA damage at tRNA genes, and (2) to establish which intermediate states of transcribing RNAP2 are responsible for impeding replisome movement and stimulating DNA damage. This work will be carried out in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: the small genome, rapid replication, and easy genetic manipulability of S. cerevisiae make this an ideal model in which to study the intersection of these fundamental biological processes. The core machineries responsible for both DNA replication and transcription are extremely highly conserved throughout eukaryotes. Therefore, the results of this work will provide molecular insights into transcription-mediated genome instability in humans, and be directly applicable to our understanding of both the etiology and progression of cancer."
"9556169","Abstract Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a universally fatal neurodegenerative disease that afflicts over 1 out of every 10,000 individuals. Protein aggregation has been implicated as a primary driving force in ALS and multiple other neurodegenerative illnesses. TDP-43 is the principle component of the protein aggregates in ALS, and TDP-43 also stands out as the only genetically defined ALS mutant gene that is also the hallmark pathology of sporadic ALS. TDP-43 is a RNA binding protein that is nuclear under basal conditions but translocates to the cytoplasm during stress where it forms RNA/protein aggregate complexes termed stress granules (SGs). Disease-linked mutations in TDP-43 enhance the ability of TDP-43 to aggregate and form SGs in vitro and in animal models. Cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates accumulate and also co-localize with SGs in the spinal cord and brain of patients with ALS, as well as in cellular and animal models of ALS. These integrated observations all point to a strong biological connection between TDP-43 and pathogenesis of ALS. Aquinnah Pharmaceuticals licensed 10 lead compounds that inhibit TDP-43 and SG aggregation that were identified in a high throughput screen performed in the laboratory of Dr. Benjamin Wolozin (Boston University School of Medicine). In Phase I of SBIR funding, we demonstrated the feasibility of targeting TDP-43 with these lead compounds for the treatment of ALS. We identified two oral bioavailable lead compounds that exhibit superb potency, brain pharmacokinetics (penetration and half-life), and show improvement in TDP-43 pathologic biomarkers in vitro and in vivo using a transgenic mouse model of TDP-43 of ALS. This SBIR Phase II proposal presents a plan for the further preclinical development of a first-in-class, novel, small molecule oral drug for the treatment of patients with ALS, to slow and possibly reverse disease progression. Following success with our aims, we will advance to an Investigation New Drug (IND) application filing with the FDA and initiate Phase I clinical trials to provide promise to patients with ALS."
"9546254","Abstract Chronic pain represents an immense clinical problem, with over 100 million Americans afflicted and an annual price tag exceeding half a trillion dollars, according to a recent report from the Institute of Medicine. Studies in our lab are designed to identify molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms of sensitization in pain pathways with the goal of identifying novel targets for analgesic intervention. Studies performed in our lab previously identified a critical signaling cascade in neurons of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) that underlies central pain sensitization. This pathway is initiated by metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5) activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase/ERK signaling, leading to increased firing of CeA neurons. This increase in excitability likely contributes to central sensitization associated with persistent pain. Our prior work, and that of several other groups, suggests that neurons in the CeA represent a critical node of neuromodulation underlying the development of chronic pain. An important finding from our prior studies was that this maladaptive plasticity in the CeA leading to persistent pain sensitization is specific to the right hemisphere. That is, no matter the sight of the injury, plasticity in the right (and not left) CeA was responsible for bilateral pain hypersensitivity. Furthermore, manipulation of neural activity only in the right CeA was found to produce bilateral pain sensitization. The mechanisms generating this hemispheric lateralization are completely unknown. In the present application, we will conduct a series of studies aimed at understanding the circuit context of CeA neurons that are activated by acute pain sensitization. We will perform studies aimed at identifying critical inputs, the type of plasticity that occurs at these synapses, and the major outputs of pain-responsive CeA neurons. We will test whether CeA neurons activated in the context of pain sensitization are necessary and sufficient for the development of pain sensitization, ongoing pain and comorbid disorders. By specifically targeting pain- activated neurons in this study, we may be able to determine if they possess unique neurochemical properties that represent novel therapeutic targets, or genetic signatures that would enable future studies to more precisely determine their function. In vivo 2-photon imaging and microendoscope cameras will be used to monitor activity of these neurons using genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensors, over days to weeks, to determine how the properties of these neurons change during the transition from acute to persistent pain. We will ask whether the population of neurons responsive to heat, cold, or touch change over time, and whether altered activity of these neurons in persistent pain conditions can be normalized using treatments that reduce pain or comorbid anxiety. These studies employ a host of modern techniques including advanced viral tracing, genetic mapping, in vivo calcium imaging, and optogenetic approaches, together with technologies developed in our lab for wireless optogenetic studies to address these important questions."
"9540366","PROJECT ABSTRACT Urinary dysfunction is among the most widespread disorders affecting aging men. Despite an annual treatment burden of over four billion dollars, therapies for this dysfunction remain based on the decades-old observation that prostate size often predicts symptoms. As a result, current treatments are effective for less than 40% of patients. To fully understand the complex etiology of this disease, we will investigate how perinatal exposure to an environmental contaminant impacts adult urinary health, a completely new direction for urologic research. Our preliminary results show that in utero and lactational (IUL) exposure to 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) causes increased susceptibility to urinary dysfunction in mice. TCDD is a widespread contaminant, ubiquitous in serum of American men, and a selective activator of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a receptor that can be activated by many persistent organic pollutants. Through histological analysis of prostate tissue from mice given IUL TCDD, we identified a possible mechanism for potentiation of urinary dysfunction: systemic changes to prostatic stroma and extracellular matrix elements, namely prostate fibrosis. A similar mechanism may mediate prostate changes in aging men, in which prostate collagen content and stiffness have been found to associate with dysfunction. These results present unique opportunities to link adult urinary dysfunction to early- life chemical exposure and clearly define the contributions of prostate fibrosis to urinary dysfunction. Using a novel combination of genetic mouse strains, chemical exposures, and computational tools, this proposal?s specific aim will test whether prostate fibrosis is sufficient to drive urinary dysfunction in mice and if anti-fibrotic drug therapy will block the effects of prostate fibrosis on urinary function. There exists a clear link between TCDD exposure, collagen composition, and urinary dysfunction, however research in this area has moved forward without foundational evidence definitively linking these phenomena. The developmental origins of adult urinary function have never been investigated and prostate fibrosis has not been fully established as causative for dysfunction. These studies will lay the groundwork needed to support these new arms of urologic toxicology research by identifying the source and types of collagen expressed in the prostate, revealing that prostate fibrosis is sufficient to drive urinary dysfunction, and mechanistically linking early-life TCDD exposure and urinary dysfunction."
"9510714","Project Summary Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) results from autoimmune-mediated destruction of the insulin-producing beta- cells within the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Inflammatory events, infiltrating leukocytes, and destruction of islet beta-cells are key contributors to disease onset. We hypothesize that suppressing pro-inflammatory stimuli will reduce the disease causing mechanisms leading to T1D. Towards this goal, we propose to investigate the use of distinct glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonists, which are not commercially available, to suppress inflammatory responses in pancreatic islets. Our published studies using mouse, rat, and human islets have indicated promising results, prompting a pursuit of in vivo pre-clinical proof of concept studies to address the basic biological processes contributing to autoimmunity and their suppression by engaging the GR. Two specific aims are proposed to investigate the efficacy and side effects of this innovative therapeutic approach. In Specific Aim 1, we will use the multiple low dose injection of streptozotocin model to investigate the in vivo effectiveness of novel glucocorticoid receptor agonists to suppress the acute inflammatory events in pancreatic islets that ultimately produce hyperglycemia. Behavioral and metabolic side effects will be monitored along with the primary immunological and physiological endpoints. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate whether our GR agonist approach prevents diabetes in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, a model of chronic inflammation that displays spontaneous onset of classic autoimmune mechanisms relevant to human T1D. Understanding the principles and mechanisms underlying innovative glucocorticoid receptor agonist approaches have important implications for suppressing, treating, and curing autoimmune diseases."
"9446841","Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) make ideal gene delivery vector candidates because they are non-pathogenic, lowly immunogenic and broadly tropic. Despite their great promise in gene therapy clinical trials for severe diseases including hemophilia and muscular dystrophy, there is a lack of understanding of fundamental aspects of the AAV life cycle. AAV tissue tropism is known to be dependent on certain rate-limiting steps within the virus life cycle, including cellular entry and trafficking from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. Further elucidation is necessary to dissect the mechanisms that direct these steps, and specifically identify the host factors that facilitate these processes. To discover novel host factors that are involved in virus entry and trafficking, we recently performed an unbiased, human genetic screen. We identified several proteins as critically important for AAV infection, including a poorly characterized transmembrane protein that we have since named AAV Receptor (AAVR). We found AAVR to be essential for the transduction of a wide array of AAV serotypes in vitro and in vivo. We observed that AAVR could bind directly to AAV particles, and that overexpression of AAVR in vitro led to enhanced AAV susceptibility. Of particular interest was the capacity of AAVR to recycle through a remarkably similar endocytic path as AAV particles. This suggests a potential post-entry role for AAVR in particle trafficking. Building upon these findings, our long-term goal seeks to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that govern rate-limiting processes within AAV?s life cycle in order to understand more about the biology of AAV, as well as harness this knowledge to improve AAV?s versatility as a vector. We intend to do this by determining: (i) what the relationship is between receptor engagement and intracellular viral trafficking, (ii) how AAVR contributes to viral tropism in vivo, and (iii) how the other major hits identified in our screen function in mediating AAV trafficking."
"9479311","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of motor neuron disorder that causes muscle weakness, disability, and eventually death. ALS is caused by selective cell death of vulnerable upper and lower motor neurons. Genetic analyses in familial ALS patients have identified several genes with mutations linked to ALS, such as C9ORF72, TDP-43, and SOD1. However, it remains unclear how these mutations lead to selective cell death of motor neurons in ALS patients, and which cell death pathways are responsible for the motor neuron cell death. Early studies suggested the involvement of apoptosis, but a more recent investigation found a role for necroptosis in one cell model. It is plausible that multiple cell death pathways are activated in the course of the disease. We recently reported that inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and subsequent accumulation of lipid peroxides, triggers a unique form of regulated cell death termed ferroptosis. Intriguingly, data from multiple ALS models as well as our own results have suggested that ferroptosis may contribute to the motor neuron cell death in ALS. Based on the experimental results indicating the role of both apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death pathways in ALS, I propose to test the hypothesis that multiple cell death pathways are activated in ALS motor neurons, focusing on the involvement of ferroptosis. Our long-term goal is to elucidate how cell death pathways are regulated (and deregulated) in human disease, and to contribute to the development of treatment strategies by modulating cell death pathways. We are particularly interested in understanding the ferroptotic cell death pathway. The objective of this proposal is to determine cell death pathways activated in degenerating motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) focused on the involvement of ferroptosis. Based on the preliminary data, the project will be pursued in two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will identify the specific cell death pathways involved in ALS using motor neuron lines (iPS-MNs) in vitro and using a transgenic mouse model of ALS in vivo. In Aim 2, we will determine the efficacy of ferroptosis inhibitor in ALS iPS-MN cell lines and in SOD1-G93A transgenic mice either as a single-agent or as a combination therapy with suppressors of other cell death modalities. This research will shed light on the molecular mechanism of motor neuron degeneration in ALS, as well as the role of ferroptosis in the disease. It may also lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. In addition, this SCORE-2 award will enhance the research environment at St. John's University and provide numerous opportunities for motivated students from diverse origin to learn the fundamentals of biomedical research."

This network consists of 14 US and 4 international clinical sites. In addition, there are more than 200 US affiliate sites which perform subject screening, a Central Coordinating Center, and several TrialNet-associated laboratories. The goals of the TrialNet consortium are to prevent or delay the onset of T1D, to test interventions aimed at decreasing beta cell destruction and/or enhancing beta cell survival in persons with T1D with residual beta cell function, and the performance of mechanistic studies. The University of Minnesota (UMN) has been a DPT-1/TrialNet Clinical Center since the beginning. Throughout this history, UMN has been highly productive and engaged, contributing intellectually to project development and reporting, and actively participating in all aspects of each TrialNet project. The aims of this renewal grant are to continue the tradition of UMN as a high-quality, high-performing TrialNet Clinical Center in the critical areas of project development, screening, recruitment, treatment, follow-up, and reporting; to increase screening rates for detection of subjects at high risk for development of T1D by further developing and supporting UMN affiliates and by exploring general population screening within new UMN research facilities at the Minnesota State Fair; and to foster collaborations with new T1D researchers in the Upper Midwest region."
"9463436","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is now a pandemic that will have significant impact on our current health care system. A common theme in obese individuals that progress towards diabetes is insulin resistance. A critical question in the field asks how obesity impairs insulin sensitivity as a first step in progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complexes (mTORC1) and 2 are multisubunit kinase complexes responsible for integrating multiple aspects of nutrient and growth factor signaling to regulate cellular anabolic processes such as cell growth, and translation. We have found that during catecholamine-induced lipolysis in fat cells the mTOR complexes are dissociated and thereby inhibited. While investigating the mechanism by which this occurs we made the novel discovery of a new class of oxidized neutral lipids that are responsible. While oxidized phospholipids have been implicated as component of lipoproteins responsible for initiating cardiovascular disease, our findings suggest that oxidized neutral lipids may analogously be responsible for adipocyte dysfunction. Completion of these aims will: 1.) define oxidized neutral lipids as novel inputs regulating mTOR complex activity, 2.) discover new strategies for inhibiting both mTOR complexes, 3.) describe the mechanism whereby catecholamines inhibit glucose uptake by adipocytes."
"9508267","ABSTRACT  The long-term aim of this research is to develop an efficient treatment against severe malaria. Specific adhesion of P. falciparum parasite-infected erythrocytes (IE) in deep vascular beds can result in severe complications, such as cerebral malaria, placental malaria, respiratory distress, and severe anemia. Even timely treatment with currently available parasite-killing drugs fails in 10?15% of severe malaria cases. Treatment with adjunct drugs that reverse and prevent parasite adhesion may significantly improve the outcome and save lives. The main idea of using anti-adhesion drugs in severe malaria is to release sequestered parasites (or prevent additional sequestration) as quickly as possible. This is extremely critical for survival because it would decrease local and systemic inflammation associated with severe disease, and help to reestablish the microvascular blood flow providing immediate relief to the patient. Concomitantly, patients would be treated with common drugs that kill parasites. This proposal is to identify individual compounds with low (<100 nM range) IC50 which inhibit cytoadhesion of IE to the host placental and brain microvasculature receptors and are suitable for development into effective adjunct drugs to treat placental and cerebral malaria, which is supported by strong preliminary data.  This multi-PI proposal is based on the success of our recently developed high throughput screening (HTS) approach for identification of anti-adhesion compounds (supported by previous R56 funding) and large combinatorial libraries (~30x106 compounds) developed at Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies (TPIMS). Our two-step HTS approach is specifically designed to work with compound mixtures to make screening and deconvolution to single active compounds fast and efficient. Specific aims of the project are: 1) De-convolute most active mixtures to identify individual compounds, and validate their anti-adhesion activity for inhibiting interactions implicated in placental and cerebral malaria using live IE. This will be done using well-validated target receptors CSA (placental malaria) and ICAM-1 (cerebral malaria), and corresponding receptor-binding domains of a family of parasite proteins PfEMP1, expressed and characterized in our previous work. Deconvolution to single active compounds (hits) is performed by 2 or 3 iterative screens on bead-bound domains of positional libraries with 100 ? 1000 mixtures/compounds. These single hits will then be synthesized, purified, characterized, and validated for IE binding inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity with live IE (lab and field) and mammalian cells. 2) Demonstrate therapeutic potential of identified anti-adhesion compounds in vitro. We will measure a number of inflammation markers, produced/changed in response to cytoadhesion of IE to vascular cells, including markers identified previously for HUVEC (with ICAM1 binding IE) and BeWo (with CSA binding IE). Returning the inflammation markers toward normal levels after treatment of IE/(BeWo or HUVEC) with anti-adhesion hits will validate their therapeutic potential in vitro. Successful completion of these Aims will provide an avenue for future hit to lead discovery of anti-adhesion drugs for adjunct treatment of severe malaria."
"9461019","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing skin disease that affects 10-20% of children and 1-3% of adults and is estimated to cost over $3 billion a year in direct medical costs in the US alone. AD is associated with the development of T helper type 2 (TH2) cell responses characterized by increased expression of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Further, changes in the composition of beneficial commensal bacterial communities have been associated with increased susceptibility to TH2 cytokine-associated inflammation, suggesting that microbial signals could have a significant influence on diseases like AD. Despite our increased understanding of the factors that promote allergic inflammation, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the development of AD remain poorly defined. In recent studies, I identified a previously unrecognized population of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) that are present in healthy human skin and are enriched in the lesional skin of AD patients. ILC2s lack markers for a variety of well-described cell types such as T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer cells and granulocytes, and therefore are referred to as lineage-negative (Lin-). However, they do express markers such as CD25 and IL-33R and can produce TH2 cell-associated cytokines following stimulation with the epithelial cell-derived cytokines thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-25 or IL-33. Employing a murine model of AD, I identified that TSLP is required for the elicitation of ILC2s in the skin and that these TSLP-elicited ILC2s are essential for the development of AD-like disease in mice lacking T and B cells. In addition, when TSLP-elicited ILC2s were transferred into na?ve wild-type mice, AD-like disease and adaptive TH2 cell responses ensued. These studies provoked the hypothesis that TSLP-elicited skin-associated ILC2s are necessary for the progression of AD-like disease and that they may directly influence TH2 cell responses in lymphocyte-sufficient hosts. This hypothesis forms the basis of Aim 1, which will address how skin-associated ILC2s influence AD-like disease and TH2 cell responses in mice and how skin-resident ILC2s in humans may influence AD in patients. In new preliminary studies, I also found that depletion or deliberate alteration of commensal bacteria by treatment with broad- spectrum antibiotics (ABX) resulted in increased TSLP expression and elevated numbers of ILC2s in the skin- draining lymph nodes, provoking the hypothesis that commensal bacteria may influence TSLP-elicited ILC2 responses and susceptibility to AD. This hypothesis forms the basis of Aim 2, which will address how alterations in commensal bacteria may regulate ILC2 responses and murine AD-like inflammation. These aims will be addressed employing the intellectual and scientific resources available to me in the Artis lab, novel TSLP-related reagents and the University of Pennsylvania Gnotobiotic Mouse Facility. As a board-certified dermatologist and a student in the Masters in Translational Research program at UPenn, I will directly accomplish the translational aspects of this project employing my clinical and translational skill sets."
"9623818","ABSTRACT Cryptosporidium parvum and C. hominis are common causative agents of chronic diarrheal disease in immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV/AIDS. Although C. parvum is primarily acquired from animals, infection with C. hominis occurs exclusively in humans. Unfortunately, the only FDA-approved drug for cryptosporidiosis is not effective in controlling infection in immunocompromised patients. Progress in studying the biology of C. hominis is hampered by the lack of small animal models or in vitro systems for long- term cultivation. Limited replication of C. hominis does occur in adenocarcinoma lines; however, these tumor cell lines do not mimic the normal physiology, metabolism, or cellular differentiation of human epithelium. The normal replicative niche for C. parvum and C. hominis is the intestinal epithelial cell, and infection is primarily concentrated in the small intestine. In preliminary studies we have shown that stem cell-derived cultures of primary mouse Intestinal Epithelial Cells (IECs) allow complete development and long-term culture of C. parvum in vitro. C. parvum undergoes both asexual and sexual phases of development in mouse IEC cultures, culminating in production of oocysts. Unfortunately, these mouse IECs do not support the growth of C. hominis, presumably due to the narrow host range of this parasite. The proposed project will adopt these advances with C. parvum to develop a similar cultivation system for C. hominis using human-derived IECs. We will also profile development of C. hominis using a bank of existing monoclonal antibodies and stage- specific gene expression markers to define specific developmental stages. These markers will provide qualitative and quantitative indicators for establishing conditions for in vitro propagation of C. hominis. If successful, these studies have the potential to be transformative in providing the first in vitro model for cultivation of C. hominis."
"9476958","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic liver disease affects over one third of Americans and over one billion people worldwide. The annual cost associated with healthcare for these individuals exceeds $20 billion in the US alone. The most common etiologies are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic liver disease, and chronic hepatitis B and C infections. Each of these is characterized by chronic hepatocellular damage, which in turn can lead to chronic inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although these causes of chronic liver disease all are very different, recent work by others and us suggests that each results in abnormalities in certain overlapping signaling pathways that, in part, mediate hepatocellular damage and the subsequent response to injury. The broad working hypothesis of this program project is that hepatocellular damage of varying etiologies, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver, alcohol, and other toxins, each leads to the development of chronic liver disease as a  consequence of disrupting multiple overlapping pathways. The goal of this program project will be to understand collectively how these distinct signaling pathways within the hepatocyte integrate in order to drive the development of chronic liver disease. This hypothesis is conceptually novel and will be highly transformative to the field of hepatology in a manner that will stimulate new ways to fundamentally re-assess how certain liver diseases are understood and treated. This hypothesis will be tested through four individual research projects. Project 1 will test whether chronic inflammation and liver injury increases expression of the type 3 isoform of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R-3) in hepatocytes, and whether expression of this particular intracellular Ca2+ channel in turn is responsible for the impaired liver regeneration that occurs in chronic liver disease/cirrhosis. Project 2 will investigate which of th three isoforms of the InsP3R are in the mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAMs) of hepatocytes and how the different channel isoforms regulate mitochondrial and ER function. Project 3 will test how the stress-responsive MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP- 1) is involved in the development of chronic hepatic inflammation and liver injury/repair and whether MKP-1 serves as central node to coordinate signals that promote liver repair. Project 4 will determine how O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) transduces toxic insults into hepatocyte survival/death signaling, and how OGT deficiency contributes to the development of chronic liver disease. To help carry out these projects, core facilities will be established for molecular, cell and animal models, cell and tissue imaging, translational studies, and administration. These four projects will collectively provide a comprehensive investigation of how major signal transduction pathways in hepatocytes integrate to regulate the balance between growth and metabolism in liver health and disease. The results of these studies will have broad clinical implications for understanding the response to injury in a range of chronic liver diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, liver disease resulting from exposure to alcohol and other hepatotoxins, and chronic viral hepatitis."
"9581735","Invasive aspergillosis (IA), caused mainly by the filamentous fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, is a severe and life-threatening infection of immunocompromised individuals. To cause invasive disease, A. fumigatus must be able to sense and utilize tissue-specific nutrient sources and effectively handle host-induced stress. A strong history of published research implicates protein kinases as essential for orchestration of a wide variety of nutrient sensing/utilization and stress response networks in pathogenic fungi. Reversible protein phosphorylation regulates almost all eukaryotic processes and, on average, about 30% of cellular proteins are modified by phosphorylation. Although no systematic analysis has yet been accomplished in A. fumigatus, the relatively few protein kinases that have been characterized play diverse roles in cellular stress responses and virulence. Furthermore, kinases are considered the second largest protein class currently functioning as drug targets, as their inhibition can be readily accomplished by small molecules. Unfortunately, the vast majority of A. fumigatus protein kinases remain unstudied. We have successfully adapted a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based mutational approach for use in wild type strains of A. fumigatus. Our preliminary data show that this facile system increases the typically low levels of gene targeting in wild type A. fumigatus to as high as 90%. With this new tool, we propose to systematically delete and functionally analyze all putative protein kinases in the wild type A. fumigatus genetic background, Af293. In Aim 1, the CRISPR/Cas9 components will be designed based on our preliminary results and purchased from commercial vendors. The necessary ribonucleotide complexes will be assembled via a short, in vitro reaction and then mixed with microhomology repair templates before protoplast transformation. Repair templates will be designed to incorporate signature tags into each kinase mutant, barcoding the strains for competitive fitness analyses. Essential kinases will be confirmed by tetracycline-regulatable promoter replacement using a modification our CRISPR/Cas9 approach. In Aim 2, we will perform competitive fitness analyses employing signature-tagged pools of kinase mutants to identify novel roles for the kinome during pathogenic growth. To identify kinases that may regulate fitness in response to host immune status, we will utilize two highly characterized models of invasive aspergillosis that re-capitulate the immune dysfunction in both neutropenic and non-neutropenic hosts. We will also perform in vitro competitive fitness assays using culture conditions that mimic pathobiologically relevant stress. A subset of the least-fit mutants from both in vivo and in vitro studies will be complemented and employed in single infection/inoculation studies to confirm roles in fitness. We expect to discover multiple, novel contributions of protein kinases to the pathobiology of invasive aspergillosis. The information generated by completion of this work will support future applications exploring novel aspects of A. fumigatus virulence."
"9481814","7. PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding how human cells organize, shape, and move their membrane-bound organelles is one of the most fundamental problems in biology. To address this challenge, my laboratory studies how the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons control membrane remodeling and organelle dynamics. As cells age, their ability to properly regulate these processes changes. This is especially true for kidney cells and immune cells, as a variety of renal and inflammatory diseases develop with age. However, the differences in cytoskeletal functions that give rise to these cellular changes during the aging process are poorly understood. In human cells, actin filament networks are assembled by proteins called nucleation factors from the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) family. Despite their importance in remodeling membranes during a wide range of processes, these nucleation factors have not been well characterized, especially as they relate to aging and mechanisms of human disease. I have a long-standing interest in determining how the cytoskeleton drives membrane dynamics in normal cells, and how these functions are altered in the context of infectious and genetic diseases. The immediate goal of this Career Development Award is to allow me to initiate another avenue of investigation on the role of the cytoskeleton in cell aging so that I can achieve my long-term goal of leading a lab which studies cytoskeletal functions in health, aging, and disease. These goals will be achieved by completing four specific aims: (1) Define roles for actin nucleation factors and regulators of autophagy in kidney disease, including Nephrocerebellar Syndrome (NCS); (2) Determine functional links between the cytoskeleton, autophagy, cytokine secretion, and inflammation during infection and aging; (3) Deepen my training in the biology of aging through collaborative training experiences at the Jackson Laboratory's Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging and at the Center on Aging at the UConn Health Center; (4) Develop into an independent investigator in the basic biology of cell aging. Given my expertise in cytoskeletal biology, plus my existing grant on the role of actin nucleation in autophagy and disease, my lab is uniquely positioned to provide key mechanistic insights into the relationships among actin nucleation factors, autophagy, kidney function, inflammation, and aging."
"9529338","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Demography of Sex Differences in Health and Survival. Is it true that males are healthier than females but die younger? If so, why? We plan demographic analyses to address these two overarching questions concerning the health-survival paradox. First, to what extent is the paradox true? How general is it? According to which definitions and measures and along which dimensions are men healthier than women? How do male-female morbidity and mortality differences vary with age? How do they vary over place? How have they varied over time? How do they vary across species of primates, other mammals and birds?  Second, to the extent that the paradox is true, why is this the case? Various social and biological hypotheses will be tested by analyzing: Human and nonhuman lifetables for males vs. females (Project 1); Data on causes of death for human males vs. females (Projects 1 and 2); Age at death of about 15,000 skeletons of adult males and females from the Mesolithic to about 1600 A.D.

The combination of (1) high-quality human data from Denmark, Utah, Russia and China together with lifetable data on many other populations, (2) an informative animal model (baboons) supplemented with extensive nonhuman lifetable data and (3) sophisticated demographic and statistical analyses will provide a deeper understanding of the basis in adults for sex differences in health and survival and of opportunities to reduce these differences."
"9478836","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the revised application NIH R01-AG046928-01, titled Effects of physical activity on brain function and network connectivity in MCI. The overall goal of this project is to assess the effect of physical activity on remediating early impairments in brain function in sedentary older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults. The need for effective treatments has become imperative, as 36 million people worldwide are affected and counting. The results from several large pharmacological trials have been sobering with a lack of significant clinical outcomes, prompting a paradigm shift to initiate treatment earlier in the disease process and explore non-pharmacological interventions. Physical activity has recently emerged as a promising intervention for delaying disease onset and slowing cognitive decline in AD. However, the effect of physical activity on neurobiological mechanisms of action, such as brain activity and network function in at risk older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a preclinical stage of AD, remains largely unexplored. Thus, there is a need for well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCT) examining functional brain health outcomes of physical activity intervention in this vulnerable population. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate physical activity as an intervention for improving functional brain health by remediating hippocampal dysfunction and enhancing functional network connectivity in MCI. Using a unique interdisciplinary approach of modern neuroscientific methodology in an RCT, a comprehensive set of outcomes will be evaluated. This project will recruit 90 sedentary participants between 50-85 years of age with amnestic MCI. Consistent with the current Surgeon General's recommendation on moderate-intensity exercise, participants will be randomly assigned to one of three home-based groups for a 6-month intervention period: 1) aerobic walking for 150 mins/week, 2) stretching active-control for 150 mins/week, and 3) health education non-active control, with 30 participants in each group. We will examine the effects of physical activity on th primary neuroimaging outcomes of regional BOLD activity in the hippocampal, functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, and intrinsic connectivity of the default mode and executive networks. Additionally, we will examine secondary outcomes of brain volume, cognition, function, and serum biomarkers associated with physical activity. The effect of regional AD pathology on change in the outcome measures will be examined using amyloid PET."
"9524116","SUMMARY The large heterogeneity of epileptic syndromes and their underlying pathophysiology represent a particular challenge to the development of pathway-specific therapies for epilepsy prevention. In many people, epilepsy is produced by specific brain ?insults?, such as trauma, infarcts, or episodes of prolonged status epilepticus (SE), while in others, epilepsy is a result of a primary genetic abnormality producing either structural or functional alterations in the developing brain. In all cases, patients are at high risk for developing epilepsy. Studies in the last decade have contributed to the view that there is an important link between oxidative stress, inflammation and epilepsy, such that seizures can induce oxidative stress and inflammation, but also that oxidative stress and enhanced pro-inflammatory signals in the brain contribute to epilepsy progression. Recent animal and human studies have identified a potential novel target that may be a central component of a cascade of such processes - the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). This transcription factor promotes the expression of multiple protective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory proteins. The major objective of this project is to determine whether dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a Nrf2 inducer that uniquely reduces oxidative stress and inflammation and is approved for other clinical indications, can prevent epilepsy in two distinct mouse models of epileptogenesis. To increase the translational potential of our study, we will also determine whether select systemic biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation are able to predict the development of epilepsy and epilepsy-associated co-morbidities (prognostic biomarkers) and monitor the acute response to treatment (pharmacodynamic biomarkers). Aim 1 will use long-term video EEG recordings of seizures and behavioral testing to determine whether DMF, when administered following induction of SE, will reduce the incidence and severity of epilepsy and reduce the associated behavioral comorbidities. Using immunohistochemical and biochemical methods, Aim 2 will assess changes in proteins associated with redox modulation, inflammation and cytokine signaling in the brain and plasma following DMF treatment in the same model, with the hypothesis that mediators that most strongly associate with disease progression will be more affected by treatment than the ones that are not. Finally, to examine whether there is more generalizable applicability of this drug to other epilepsies, in Aim 3 we will determine whether DMF can prevent or delay the development of epilepsy in a tuberous sclerosis model of epilepsy and cognitive dysfunction."
"9653492","Project Summary/Abstract  CADENCE-Adults is an R01 study that will calibrate cadence (steps/min) and intensity in 260 ambulatory adults, 10 men and 10 women for each 5-year age-group category between 21-85 years, effectively covering the adult lifespan. Cadence is one of the temporal-spatial parameters of gait. Cadence multiplied by stride length equals speed. Capture and expression of objectively monitored physical activity in terms of cadence represents an overlooked opportunity to represent free-living patterns of ambulatory intensity. There is merit in being able to ?translate? technological and analytical advances into more accessible terms, especially if public health goals are to be realized. Cadence represents a minimally processed and translatable metric that could be collected and interpreted across objective instruments, including those used in the lab, in the clinic, and in the real world. The primary aim of CADENCE-Adults is to identify objectively observed (video-taped) and manually counted cadence (steps/min) criterion cut points associated with markers of increasing intensity across age groupings. A secondary aim is to compare multipleinstruments' abilities to accurately detect criterion values for cadence at different speeds and thus better inform our confidence in comparing this metric across instruments. To achieve these aims, cadence and oxygen uptake data will be collected during a treadmill assessment of incrementally faster paces and also using portable metabolic testing of common free- living activities to test the primary hypothesis: Activity intensity (oxygen uptake) will increase in a linear or nonlinear (curvilinear) fashion as cadence increases such that we will be able to develop statistical models for predicting markers (cut points) of intensity from cadence. We are uniquely positioned at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center to successfully conduct CADENCE-Adults as designed in a 5-year time period. We have conducted pilot testing demonstrating the feasibility of this project, established recruiting methods, and are fully experienced in exercise testing, accelerometry, and management of large complex data sets. We expect that cadence cut points established in CADENCE-Adults will be used both to assess ambulatory intensity, but also to inform program design focused on increasing not only the volume of physical activity (e.g., steps/day) but also its intensity (e.g., cadence) in user-friendly metrics. No similar data exist at this time so the approach described in this application is both innovative and critical to providing a minimally processed and translatable objectively monitored metric with established cut points across the lifespan."
"9545300","Project Summary/Abstract Clinical trials remain the gold standard for evidence-based assessment of investigational treatments and are essential to the development of desperately needed therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD trials, including those sponsored by NIH and industry, now enroll patients with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The cognitive status of these populations necessitates enrollment of two individuals, a participant and a study partner. The quality of AD trial data is inherently tied to the study partner's ability to provide complete, accurate, and consistent assessments of patient outcomes. If study partners are not qualified to fill their role or are replaced, patients may dropout or their data may be at risk for inaccuracy. This proposal examines whether particular study partners disproportionately contribute to trial variance and potential bias due to conditional confounding. We hypothesize that study partner characteristics are associated with variance and bias in trials. We have assembled data from actual AD and MCI trials, enabling studies to examine our hypothesis with the greatest generalizability possible. Specifically, we will examine whether study partner characteristics are associated with trial recruitment, retention, and data integrity outcomes. We also will examine the impact of informant replacement on trial data. We will perform modeling experiments that investigate the implications of altering trial enrollment patterns and protocol decisions on trial data precision and accuracy. Finally, we will develop software that incorporates our results and enables trialists to better plan their studies. This project will yield a greater understanding of study partner impact on trial data integrity and will enable improved design and conduct to reduce missing data and increase statistical power and data validity."
"9476895","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Living Alone in Older Age with Cognitive Impairment The applicant for this K01 award is Dr. Elena Portacolone, an Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Portacolone's long-term career goal is to establish an interdisciplinary research program that is focused on the health, well-being, and social integration of older adults living alone (OALA) with cognitive impairment. In prior research, the applicant raised awareness of the unique challenges faced by OALA. This K01 award will allow Dr. Portacolone to significantly extend the scope of her research and methodological approaches. Dr. Portacolone seeks the support of a K01 award to expand the body of knowledge on OALA with cognitive impairment. This original research direction is driven by the high prevalence of cognitive impairment in OALA and significant evidence suggesting that living alone in older age with cognitive impairment may lead to poor health outcomes. To conduct her research program, Dr. Portacolone seeks the support of a K01 award to develop skills and knowledge in cognitive impairment, ethics, advanced qualitative methods of research and analysis, and other aspects of academic development. Training in these areas will enable the applicant to accomplish the following specific research aims: 1) to examine in detail the experience of living alone as an OALA with cognitive impairment; 2) to understand the relationships between these individuals and their support networks; and 3) to understand the decision-making ability of OALA with cognitive impairment and explore how this ability relates to their experience of day-to-day decisions when living alone. To achieve these aims, Dr. Portacolone will use advanced qualitative methods of research analysis, as they are the most appropriate to expand the body of knowledge on unexplored areas where hypothesis generation is premature. Dr. Portacolone will recruit 90 OALA, 30 with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 30 with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 30 cognitively healthy OALA as control group. OALA will be recruited from clinics at UCSF as well as from local organizations. For each OALA with MCI or AD, the applicant will seek to recruit and interview one informant. Data will consist of personal narratives elicited through ethnographic interviews. These interviews will be supplemented with participant observation and interpretation of data from standard quantitative measures. Qualitative data will be analyzed using advanced methods of qualitative analysis described below. This innovative study will build knowledge of culturally-sensitive clinical interventions to (1) improve understanding of those with the diagnosis of cognitive impairment living alone and (2) identify potential strategies that will increase the qualty of life of OALA with cognitive impairment. The knowledge and experience gained from this research will allow Dr. Portacolone to develop significant publications in high-impact journals and prepare a competitive R01 application to address possible points of interventions for OALA with cognitive impairment. The specific design of this larger investigation will be informed by the findings of the research project undertaken for the K01 award."
"9430840","Nosocomial pneumonia is the major cause of death at the hospitals among seriously injured trauma patients, though the link between injury and development of nosocomial pneumonia is still not well recognized. Our preliminary results strongly suggest that mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs) released after tissue injury play a major role in the onset of nosocomial pneumonia by attracting polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) to the injury site and thus decreasing the pool of PMN available for killing bacteria in lungs, hence leading to development of pneumonia. Indeed, our data demonstrate that bacteria are cleared from the lungs of healthy animals but not injured animals. In addition, exposure of PMN to mtDAMPs results in desensitization of N-formylated-peptide receptor 1 (FPR-1) as well as other chemokine receptors (via homo- and heterologous desensitization) leading to limiting recruitment of PMN to the lungs after bacterial infection. Thus inhibition of FPR-1 function soon after injury could prevent PMN chemotaxis to the site of injury and desensitization of chemokine receptors, and thus could be a good therapeutic strategy allowing PMN to respond to the chemokines released from the cells in the lungs during bacterial infection. Our preliminary data also indicate that simultaneous application of bacteria and syngeneic PMN after injury improves bacterial clearance in mouse lungs. Therefore, we propose an innovative and simple treatment of direct delivery of PMN to the lungs. Our ultimate goal is to establish the methods for prevention and/or treatment for nosocomial pneumonia in seriously injured people. We hypothesize that inhibition of PMN chemotaxis toward mtDAMPs released at the site of injury and/or direct administration of PMN to the lungs will prevent development of nosocomial pneumonia in trauma patients. Thus we list two specific aims as shown below. Specific Aim 1. Investigate whether blocking of FPR-1 increases PMN migration to the infected lungs and enhances bacterial clearance Hypothesis: Blocking of PMN migration to the site of injury increases a pool of PMN migrating to infected lungs. Specific Aim 2. Establish whether intratracheal PMN infusion clears lung bacteria in mice after injury Hypothesis: Delivery of active PMN to infected lungs will prevent pneumonia. !"
"9281580","Project Summary/Abstract  The algorithm and data analysis (ADA) core of this phase III COBRE will provide basic and advanced centralized image analysis resources for processing multimodal imaging data. These resources include tools designed for basic and advanced analysis of structural MRI (sMRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), function MRI (fMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), and genetics data. The ADA Core will play a leading role in developing and providing software that is needed to solve basic image analysis problems that arise when working with MR and MEG/EEG data. This will be accomplished by providing a core set of tools and approaches for analysis of imaging and genetic data. The core set of resources includes expertise and tools for analyzing all first level-imaging data (automated pipeline preprocessing) as well as advanced algorithms for network-based functional and structural connectivity measures to address in a comprehensive way the scientific questions being asked. We will work with the tools developed locally as well as widely- used tools developed by other groups to enable network-based analysis, data-fusion of multimodal data, and prediction/classification approaches. Importantly, a key aspect of this COBRE and the ADA core is focused on combining multimodal data enabling investigators to leverage additional information via joint analysis of multiple modalities (data fusion). An additional area of emphasis will be on the development of realistic simulation approaches, to enable comparisons of algorithms, optimization of parameters, and to provide intuition about how new algorithms work. Finally, the ADA core will also provide essential training about data analysis of brain imaging and genetic data, as well as mentoring for specific projects. This will ensure investigators and potential core users are informed about the various algorithms, understand how to make analysis choices given a particular hypothesis, and have a basic idea of how to implement such algorithms themselves. The director of the ADA Core is Dr. Calhoun, who has over 20 years of experience in developing tools and approaches for working with unimodal and multimodal imaging and genetics data. Co-director Dr. Cheryl Aine has extensive experience in unimodal and multimodal imaging with MEG/EEG. 1"
"9471816","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Half of all Americans over the age of 60 have diverticulosis of the colon, and 20-25% are expected to develop acute diverticulitis. While most episodes resolve with antibiotics alone, 10-20% will have an emergency colectomy/colostomy at their initial presentation and all patients remain at lifetime risk for recurrent episodes. Given te uncertainty of when and where a recurrent episode will occur and the looming risk of colostomy, surgeons have been trained to recommend elective, prophylactic colectomy after 2 episodes, and earlier for those < 50 years. As a result, diverticulitis is now one of the leading reasons for elective colectomy. However, counseling patients after recovering from an episode of diverticulitis is challenging because less than 5% will go on to need emergency surgery and the major morbidity (5%) and recurrence rate (5-11%) after elective resection is not trivial. Several professional societies have now recommended delaying elective resection and called for research to determine its value. Despite these cautions, over the last decade the use of elective resection has increased more than 50%. Elective resections are rising at a much faster rate than the incidence of diverticulitis, coinciding with the widespread adoption of laparoscopy. Given this unexpected trend, it is important to assess the patterns of practice related to early or delayed resection, factors driving decision making, and the impact of the disease on those who do and do not have an elective resection. To address these issues we propose 3 related, but independent studies that describe treatment patterns after recovery from an episode of acute diverticulitis, the factors associated with early and delayed elective surgery, and outcomes and impact of the disease. Aim 1 uses national claims data for a population-level assessment of current patterns of care related to numbers of episodes of treated diverticulitis prior to elective resection. Aim 2 compare how often patients undergoing early versus delayed resection and young vs old report clinical and non-clinical factors as the reason for elective resection. Information from this group about decision making related to elective resection may help explain practice patterns identified in Aim 1. To assess the impact of diverticulitis on all those with the condition, Aim 3 involves a statewide cohort of all patients who recover from an episode of confirmed diverticulitis, assessing how often patients have symptoms related to diverticulitis, patient-reported outcomes, and the burden of the disease over time. Together these studies will determine if the observed, dramatic increase in the use of elective surgery for diverticulitis is consistent with recommendations about delayed intervention, provide better understanding about the factors associated with decisions for elective surgery and provide critical information about the impact of diverticulitis. This information will be helpful in crafting interventions aime at more patient-centered and value-added care and inform decision making. This information will also be critical in the development of comparative studies of colon resection and other treatments for diverticulitis."
"9501622","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune mediated disease of the central nervous system in which an aberrant immunological response targets myelin, leading to short-term neurological dysfunction (exacerbations) and ultimately to permanent disability. Demyelination of axons is potentially a major contributor to irreversible neuronal loss and secondary irrecoverable disability. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are an endogenous pool of oligopotent stem cells capable of replenishing damaged or lost oligodendrocytes and are found throughout the brain and within lesions of MS patients. However, incompletely understood factors appear to inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation and resultant remyelination after inflammatory injury in MS. The use of EAE as a clinical and immunological model to illuminate MS has contributed significantly to the growing arsenal of immunomodulatory therapies available for treatment. MRI has also been a useful early phase clinical outcome that has helped improve efficiency of selection of compounds for phase III development as immunomodulatory agents. No similar models or methods exist for demonstrating and confirming therapeutic potential for remyelinating agents. In this project we will conclusively establish the histological and ultrastructural correlates of visual evoked potential latency in multiple models of visual pathway demyelination. These systems will allow us to disentangle the role of demyelination from inflammation and axonal loss by using a) genetically engineered models with enhanced and abrogated myelinating capacity, b) a validated remyelinating compound previously assessed by multiple groups in both rodent and human cells as well as rodent spinal cord, c) non-inflammatory demyelinating models using chemical demyelination methods and d) a unique primate monocular chemical demyelinating model. Furthermore, we have completed a phase II clinical trial that clemastine improves latency on visual evoked potentials in human MS patients with chronic optic neuropathy. Our preliminary work suggests that VEP may be more sensitive than clinical scoring for detecting demyelination and/or that the visual pathway itself is sensitive to early injury in EAE. We have optimized a VEP protocol for mice with exceptional reproducibility and high throughput capacity. We have also developed and/or begun working with models capable of dissecting the impact of demyelination, remyelination, inflammation and axonal loss for better understanding the factors that influence VEP signal. This work will help to establish VEP in EAE and confirm the cellular basis of changes on the VEP signal in general. It will thereby resolve a currently unmet need and accelerate the preclinical and early clinical development of therapies for remyelination in MS."

"9484339","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biofeedback of real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) data is a new technique in which the activity in a specific region of a subject's brain is provided as a feedback signal to the subject. The subject can experiment with different cognitive strategies to identify those that are effective in influencing brain activty in the region of interest. By practicing those strategies and monitoring their success, subjects can train themselves to control the target brain region. The proposed research project applies this technique to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). More specifically, the project examines whether biofeedback of rt-fMRI data can enable individuals with OCD to develop control over activity in a region of their orbitofrontal cortex involved in symptom anxiety and thereby reduce their obsessive-compulsive symptoms. If so, this new technique may yield a low-risk, non-invasive clinical intervention for OCD. In addition, patterns of resting state functional connectivty between brain areas will be examined before and after biofeedback to determine how intrinsic brain dynamics are altered by the intervention, and how those alterations relate to changes in clinical symptoms. This will inform our understanding of the network dynamics underlying obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Although this research project is focused on developing a protocol specifically for treating and studying OCD, the methodology has great promise as both a treatment intervention and a research tool for a broad range of neuropsychiatric disorders."

The model of being either a researcher or a clinician ought to be supplanted by one where talented and enthusiastic individuals have exposure to the information, techniques and colleagues necessary for the growing need for collaborative science. In addition, there is a clear need for a program that is suitable for physician postdoctoral fellows, especially since CTSA funded K awards are extremely limited. To develop such a cadre, we propose a novel training program with a customized curriculum of investigative and clinically relevant experiences, individually tailored to each trainee and focused on a clinica area or disease process. Specifically, each curriculum will comprise 1) laboratory-based research, guided by their Mentor and Mentoring Committee composed of program members with complementary strengths and expertise; 2) didactics chosen with the translational aspects of that research project in mind; and 3) clinical involvement (for physician trainees) complementary to the research project. In addition to providing our trainees with rigorous scientific instruction in the specific area of their choosing, we shall mentor and guide them to ensure a successful transition to productive investigative careers, preparing them for independent skin biology and skin disease related biomedical research. We propose to engage three MD, PhD or MD/PhD trainees annually into a two-year postdoctoral training program. We have assembled a stellar team of mentors in broad areas relevant to cutaneous biology and skin diseases, and an innovative guidance program to ensure that we grow mentors as well as trainees."

"9606599","Project Summary / Abstract In an exciting era of growth in the use of non-invasive brain stimulation, new methods and applications are being disseminated widely with an increasing number of FDA approvals and equipment designed to probe or modulate the brain in fascinating new ways. The problem with this growing enthusiasm is that there are too few studies that have evaluated how tools such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) induce functional activation throughout a human brain, especially outside of the motor system. Neuromodulation made possible by administering trains of repetitive TMS (rTMS) is even more poorly understood since it requires capturing dynamic changes in the brain that are at the root of proposed changes in function. We have developed a protocol for assaying circuit communication by single pulse TMS delivered while recording functional MRI to follow brain wide effects of TMS to various prefrontal cortex targets. We are beginning to measure this circuit- specific communication flow before and after neuromodulatory rTMS to the same circuit to quantify changes in dynamics resulting from these acute brain interventions. With the proposed research, we plan to optimize targeting of two brain networks with TMS: inferior frontal gyrus to amygdala and lateral prefrontal to subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. By individualizing targeting from each person's functional MRI mapping, we believe that we can optimize our ability to affect the brain and ultimately better understand variability in behavioral response to TMS. A key set of proposed metrics for establishing a firmer understanding of TMS effects on the brain will be two different hypothesized dose/response relationships: 1) Circuit activation will increase as a function of absolute stimulation level and 2) Circuit communication will be modulated as a function of the cumulative number of rTMS pulses delivered during neuromodulatory brain stimulation. 3) Finally, to increase our chances of capturing a stratified sample of circuit integrity in the targeted pathways that are thought to be disrupted in affective disorders, a sub-sample of the recruited participants (who will otherwise be healthy) will be recently diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Significance: Our comprehensive assay of brain response to TMS will include TMS probe responses as well as resting fMRI recorded before, during, and after application of neuromodulatory TMS. This strategy will yield a significant step forward in understanding how non-invasive brain stimulation affects human brain functioning that can be a methodological and theoretical base for tool development and novel brain-based therapeutics."
"9606843","Abstract The heat shock protein (HSP) gp96 is immunogenic. Depending on which antigen presenting cell (APC) is targeted by gp96 in the extracellular environment, these immune responses can be opposingly of the Th1 or Treg type. These immune responses have been harnessed for the immunotherapy of cancer and infectious disease or autoimmune disease respectively. We have shown that the gp96 receptor, CD91, is expressed by conventional dendritic cell (cDCs) which allows for cross-presentation of the antigens chaperoned by gp96 and for provision of co-stimulation for Th1 responses. We have recently uncovered CD91 expression on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). There is currently no information on how pDCs influence gp96-mediated immune responses and specifically, how Treg responses are modulated. Our hypothesis is that engagement of pDCs by gp96 via CD91 leads to intracellular signaling and upregulation of molecules associated with priming and stabilization of Treg function. Our studies here explore how gp96 engages the various APC populations in situ, the intracellular signaling with pDCs, and the phenotype of gp96-activated pDCs in the context of priming Tregs and enhancement of their function. This pathway has consequences not only for tumor development and infection but in autoimmunity, and in immunotherapy of these diseases."

"9699980","Project Summary/Abstract  The overall goal of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is to collect data to improve the health of infants and mothers in the preconception, perinatal, or postpartum periods. Massachusetts (MA) has implemented PRAMS since 2007. PRAMS data were the first to quantify the oral health needs of pregnant and postpartum women in MA, and served as a catalyst to developing the MA Perinatal Oral Health Practice Guidelines for Pregnancy and Early Childhood. Concerning other areas of interest, reliable data are even more limited or nonexistent. For example, MA did not have population-based data on postpartum depression. PRAMS data supported the passage of ?An Act Relative to Postpartum Depression? bill in 2010 and since then new programs such as the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project (MCPAP) for Moms have begun to address maternal depression in MA. In addition, PRAMS data supported the selection of a mental health priority for the MA five-year Maternal and Child Health Title V Block Grant by including questions on social connectedness.  MA is in a unique position to conduct linkages with its Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal (PELL) data system, a longitudinal database which includes a range of datasets linked together. Linkage of PRAMS and PELL data provides an innovative, longitudinal data system with a range of information on preconception and interconception health and health care utilization. It enables an assessment of the associations between maternal characteristics, experiences, attitudes and behaviors before, during and shortly after pregnancy with longer-term health outcomes (e.g. maternal and infant mortality, and subsequent maternal and infant hospital utilization and associated costs), which cannot be ascertained from a linkage of PRAMS data to birth certificate data alone.  PRAMS methodology uses a mail survey with telephone follow up to inquire about maternal attitudes, experiences and behaviors. There are approximately 72,000 births annually, of which 2,400 are sampled for inclusion in MA PRAMS. The overall weighted response rate was 66.1%, 68.5%, and 67.5%, for 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively."

"9541834","Abstract Despite aggressive chemotherapy, surgical resection, and radiation therapy, glioblastoma (GBM) remains almost universally fatal. A recent randomized, control trial demonstrated RNA-loaded dendritic cell (DC) vaccines significantly prolong overall and progression free survival in patients with primary GBM. Moreover, this trial also demonstrated that dendritic cell migration to lymph nodes could be used a clinically meaningful predictor of patient response to treatment. This technique provides researchers a surrogate endpoint to develop enhanced dendritic cell vaccine protocols and could provide clinicians with a powerful tool to predict patient response to treatment just 48 hours after vaccination. However, the high regulatory requirements associated with standard methods of tracking cell migration limit future application of this technique. This project is designed to evaluate use of theranostic RNA-loaded nanoparticles (RNA-NPs) to enhance and track DC migration to LNs. Preliminary evidence indicates that RNA-NPs 1) stimulate potent DC activation 2) enhance DC migration to LNs, and 3) can be loaded with sufficient levels of iron oxide to be tracked with MRI. This study will test the hypothesis that RNA-NPs can be used to enhance DC migration to LNs, predict vaccine efficacy with MRI, and improve antitumor immune responses. These goals will be assessed with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine effects of RNA-NP loading on dendritic cell activation and migration to LNs Unique benefits of RNA-NP loading on DC activation will be assessed with genomic analysis of intracellular signaling pathways. Functional consequences of RNA-NP loading will be determined in a murine model of our vaccine protocol. Aim 2: Determine predictive utility of MRI-detected dendritic cell migration The sensitivity of MRI based detection of RNA-NP loaded DCs will be determined by correlating changes in MRI intensity to absolute counts of RNA-NP-loaded DsRed+ DCs in lymph nodes. The predictive value of MRI- detected DC migration will then be assessed in a murine glioma model. Aim 3: Evaluate efficacy of RNA-NP loaded dendritic cells in a murine model of GBM Mice will be vaccinated with RNA-NP-loaded DCs. Antigen specific T cell activation will be assessed with a T cell killing assay. Survival benefit over other DC preparation methods will be assessed in an aggressive temozolomide and radiation resistant murine model of high grade glioma. Significance This project promises to produce a powerful tool to enhance and predict long term survival in patients with GBM. The combination of a readily accessible imaging component with a robustly stimulatory nanoparticle formulation would allow streamlined manufacturing of a low cost, theranostic nanoparticle that would provide clinicians an unprecedented advantage in patient management."
"9316211","PROJECT SUMMARY Genomic instabilities drive the progression of cancer, aging, and other human diseases. The integrity of our genome is especially at risk while it is being replicated, as replication forks often encounter obstacles to their progression, including DNA lesions, hard-to-replicate sequences, transcription intermediates, or protein-DNA complexes. These encounters often result in DNA breaks, gross chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidy, which are key events in cancer initiation. The proper repair of stalled or collapsed replication forks through homologous recombination (HR)-based mechanisms plays a major role in preventing replication stress-induced genomic instabilities and many mutations in components of the HR machinery have been associated with cancer predisposition. In the absence of an intact HR-machinery, error-prone mechanisms such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) tend to become hyper-utilized, leading to extensive genomic instability. The regulatory basis of the recruitment of HR and NHEJ factors to DNA lesions is therefore of central interest to genome biology and cancer research, not only for explaining the mechanisms of tumorigenesis, but also for providing promising avenues for cancer therapy, as recently demonstrated for PARP inhibitors that are now approved for treatment of ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1 mutations in Europe and the US. This proposal will investigate a new mechanism for regulation of recombinational DNA repair and repair pathway choice. The central hypothesis is that the evolutionarily conserved scaffolding protein TopBP1 plays a central, yet largely unexplored, role in the control of HR-mediated repair and DNA repair pathway choice. Utilizing biochemical, proteomic and genetic approaches in yeast, human cell lines and genome-edited mice, we will define the molecular mechanism by which TopBP1 and its yeast ortholog Dpb11 control DNA repair. Our studies will provide unparalleled molecular understanding of how the action of key HR and NHEJ factors are coordinated and will reveal how signaling networks integrate the control of DNA replication, checkpoint signaling and DNA repair. Proposed experiments will reveal novel mechanisms of repair pathway choice and recombinational repair that are crucial to suppress genomic instability and cancer. Generated outcomes will have implications in the study of tumorigenesis caused by dysfunctions in HR repair and should provide new rationale for therapy."
"9488054","ABSTRACT  Monkey B virus (BV) is a herpesvirus common in macaque (rhesus, cynomolgus) monkeys which are an invaluable resource for biomedical research. When BV is transmitted to humans, ~80% of patients die and survivors frequently experience progressive neurological decline, making BV the single greatest zoonotic danger facing research and veterinary personnel who work with macaques. Drugs currently used to treat BV infections were developed for treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, and are all are less effective against BV than HSV. Even when treated with ganciclovir (GCV), the most effective drug, some BV patients still die. Studies in mice also suggest that the current recommended treatment protocol may be flawed, allowing undetected BV infections to invade the central nervous system, resulting in a drastically diminished chance of patient survival. Since new drugs specifically targeted at BV are unlikely to be developed due to a lack of financial incentive, therapy using existing antivirals needs to be optimized. In the proposed study drugs shown to be effective against HSV and some experimental drugs will be tested for in vivo efficacy against BV by systemic administration using a mouse model. Preliminary experiments indicate that drugs applied topically can provide protection against BV that is as effective as systemically administered drugs. In addition, cidofovir (CDV) appears to be more effective against BV than GCV (the most effective drug currently recommended for treatment of BV infections) and an experimental drug having a different mode of action than GCV or CDV is also effective against BV, raising the possibility of its use in a dual drug regimen for added treatment efficacy. These results need to be followed up with additional research to validate use of topical drug delivery as a means of preventing neurological BV infections, use of CDV to treat BV infections, and the potential efficacy of dual drug regimens. This project will produce the needed confirmatory data and test the efficacy of dual drug regimens. The results will serve as a rational scientific basis for possible modification of existing recommendations for treatment of zoonotic BV infections."
"9475799","The capacity to reverse an inborn error within the context of the human chromosome has long held a certain  fascination for workers in the tield of molecular medicine. It is now widely accepted that single-stranded DNA  oligonucleotides can direct the genetic exchange of a single base in the DNA and therefore can correct a  single base mutation in a disease like Sickle Cell Anemia. This approach is known as gene editing. The  mechanism of action and the regulation of gene editing depend on the ability of the ssODN to align in  homologous register at the target site in the genome. While this approach has shown significant scientific  merit, the frequency with which gene editing takes place falls short of clinical relevance. Herein we propose  to develop a combinatorial approach to gene editing utilizing Transcription Activator-like Effector Nucleases  (TALENs) to create a specific double stranded (ds) DNA break site near the mutant base in the  chromosome. Ds DNA breaks are known to increase gene editing directed by ssODNs by activating auxiliary  DNA repair and cell cycle protein that help catalyze base exchange. We have already demonstrated that the  combinatorial activity of ssODNs and TALENs in gene editing enhances the frequency of gene editing by  testing in a validated, well established model system with both phenotypic and genotypic readouts. In this  proposal, we intend to apply combinatorial gene editing to the reversal of a (3S allele in CD34+ cells. We will  characterize and optimize reaction parameters including the length of the ssODN, the cleavage site of  TALEN and the position of the mismatch within the paired chromosomal DNA complex. Importantly, we will  also evaluate the CD34+ cell for genotoxic and/or metabolic impacts of gene editing process itself. The key  is to minimize the downstream effects of that activation by using this new combinatorial approach, while  increasing the actual frequency of mutation repair. The aims of this grant are interwoven but also  independent and significant information can be gained from the experimental outcomes of each of them. We  hope to achieve a working protocol that will advance gene editing toward clinical implementation for Sickle  Cell Disease."
"9481801","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NIA Interventions Testing Program represents a multi-site translational research program to evaluate agents hypothesized to extend mouse lifespan by retardation of aging or postponement of late life diseases. Interventions proposed by multiple collaborating scientists from the research community are initially tested, in parallel, at three sites (Jackson Laboratories, Michigan and Texas), using identical, standardized protocols, and using sufficient numbers of genetically heterogeneous mice to provide 80% power for detecting changes in lifespan of 10%, for either sex, after pooling data from any two of the test sites. Forty such lifespan experiments, involving various doses of 25 distinct agents, have been initiated in the first nine years of the ITP. Significant effects on longevity, in one or both sexe, have been documented for 5 of the tested agents: aspirin, NDGA, rapamycin, acarbose, and 17-?-estradiol. Initial lifespan trials are now underway for 8 agents, as well as comprehensive analyses of the effects of rapamycin, acarbose, and NDGA on health and on cellular and physiological traits thought likely to mediate the beneficial effects seen. Plans for the next five year period include additional lifespan (Stage I) trials, detailed analyses (Stage II) of agent found to increase lifespan, and increased emphasis on collaborations with other scientists skilled at evaluating traits related to health and disease or at testing ideas about mechanisms of drug action on aging. Each of the three ITP laboratories will bring special expertise to the effort measures of age-sensitive traits at the Jackson Laboratory, pathology and statistical analysis at Michigan, and pharmacology at the University of Texas."

"9575522","Neurosurgery to relieve life-threatening edema (decompressive craniectomy) or gain temporary access to the brain for tumor resection (craniotomy) requires removal of a portion of the skull (i.e. bone flap). The infection incidence after craniotomy/craniectomy ranges from 0.8-12%, with a significant number caused by methicillin- resistant S. aureus (MRSA), which forms a biofilm on both surfaces of the bone flap. Biofilms are bacterial communities encased in a self-produced matrix that are recalcitrant to antibiotics due to their metabolic dormancy. Our laboratory has developed a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy-associated biofilm infection that shares important ultrastructural and MRI attributes with human disease, which can be exploited to identify mechanisms for infection persistence. We have identified a unique immune compartmentalization in the S. aureus craniotomy model, namely preferential neutrophil (PMN) recruitment and chemokine expression in the subcutaneous galea, whereas monocytes are more prominent in the brain. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), an immature granulocyte population with anti-inflammatory properties, are present in both compartments, but most abundant in the galea. Our preliminary studies have identified a role for IL-10 in promoting S. aureus survival in both the galea and brain, suggesting that IL-10 may be critical for programming glia and infiltrating leukocytes towards an anti-inflammatory state to promote biofilm persistence. Although IL- 10 is expressed in both the galea and brain, the cytokine is poised to inhibit the antibacterial activity of cell types that are enriched at either site, namely PMNs and MDSCs (galea) vs. microglia, astrocytes, and monocytes (brain). In terms of molecular mechanisms, our preliminary data demonstrate that S. aureus- derived lactate induces IL-10 production in MDSCs. Since lactate is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) and the IL-10 promoter is regulated by histone acetylation, this supports the hypothesis that S. aureus biofilm- derived lactate is an exogenous HDACi that promotes IL-10 expression and inhibits antimicrobial responses in the galea and brain by targeting MDSCs/PMNs vs. microglia/astrocytes/monocytes, respectively, to promote infection persistence. The crosstalk between IL-10 and galeal vs. brain populations and the molecular mechanisms responsible for this compartmentalized specificity will be tested in the following Specific Aims. 1) Identify the role of MDSC-derived IL-10 on PMN antimicrobial activity in the galea during S. aureus craniotomy- associated biofilm infection; 2) Determine whether IL-10 promotes S. aureus persistence in the brain during craniotomy-associated biofilm infections by polarizing glia and monocytes towards an anti-inflammatory state; and 3) Establish that S. aureus biofilm-derived lactate enhances IL-10 production by inhibiting HDAC activity. An improved understanding of the immune compartmentalization during craniotomy biofilm infection may be leveraged to enhance antimicrobial activity and biofilm clearance in both the galea and brain. Our findings suggest that IL-10 represents an attractive candidate to explore for this purpose."
"9693351","Taste is a fundamental sense and is crucial for human health. Like our other primary senses, we consider our ability to appreciate sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami tastes to be relatively constant, even though the taste bud cells that transduce these stimuli are renewed rapidly and regularly. The importance of the sense of taste is particularly evident for cancer patients receiving a range of chemotherapies, as these individuals often experience significant taste loss (ageusia) or dysfunction (dysgeusia). For patients with perturbed taste, simply eating a meal can be unpleasant or impossible; patients have significantly reduced quality of life including depression, lack of appetite and failure to maintain body weight, as well as poorer outcomes with cancer treatment. In particular, Basal Cell Carcinoma patients treated with drugs that target the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway frequently experience dysgeusia. Interestingly Hh antagonists cause taste bud loss in mice, suggesting that functional taste loss in patients given these drugs is due to an effect on taste buds. Yet a mechanistic understanding of how taste bud homeostasis is impacted by Hh inhibition remains unexplored. And hence treatments to mitigate taste loss for cancer patients are yet to be imagined. Sonic hedgehog (Shh), one of 3 secreted Hh ligands, is implicated in taste bud cell renewal based on its expression pattern and that of its target gene, Gli1. A subset of taste bud cells is Shh+, while Gli1 expression is restricted to proliferating progenitor cells outside of buds, suggesting that Shh from within buds signals to adjacent progenitors to control taste cell turnover. However, the cellular and molecular processes regulated by Hh signaling are unknown, representing a significant gap in our knowledge of taste bud cell biology, and further limits our understanding of how Hh antagonists alter taste. Here, based on published reports and our pilot data, we propose the novel hypothesis that: Hedgehog signaling is required for taste receptor cell (TRC) differentiation and taste bud maintenance. We will test this overarching hypothesis using mouse models in 3 aims, and in completing these, greatly expand understanding of basic cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for taste cell renewal, as well as define mechanistically how Hh pathway-targeted chemotherapy disrupts this process. Aim 1 Determine if Shh promotes TRC differentiation from taste progenitor cells. Aim 2 Identify the tissue source(s) of Shh required for TRC differentiation. Aim 3 Define cellular mechanisms underlying loss of differentiated TRCs in mice treated with Hh antagonist."
"9606913","ABSTRACT:  The strategic plan of the NIH's BRAIN Initiative (BRAIN 2025: A scientific Vision) calls for transformative technological developments with MRI to achieve ?submillimeter spatial resolution descriptions of neuronal activity, functional and structural connectivity, and network analysis in the human brain through advances in instrumentation, data acquisition and analysis techniques?. The primary aim of this grant application is specifically to undertake such technological developments. We plan to usher in the next generation MR instrumentation, and data acquisition and image reconstruction methods in order to reach and span currently unavailable spatial scales in human brain studies, going from neuronal ensembles composed of few thousand neurons to whole brain function and structural connectivity. The focus of the proposed work will be resting state- and task- or stimulus-based functional imaging (fMRI), and diffusion imaging (dMRI) methods for tractography and white-matter microstructure determination. We present a strategy, based on ample preliminary data, to develop and implement unique and novel gradients, B0 shims, RF coils, image acquisition and reconstruction methods, and previously unavailable 10.5 Tesla ultrahigh magnetic field. As a result of the cumulative gains from the proposed technologies, we anticipate an order of magnitude or more reduction in voxel volumes, thus reaching and even exceeding the resolution targets set forth in the BRAIN Initiative strategic plan. Using this new capability, we also plan to generate a publicly available database that will enable the most complete and accurate description of the functional and structural connections among gray matter locations in the human brain to date, and facilitate advanced computational modeling of how information is encoded by neural populations in the human brain.  The proposed developments will be carried out by a consortium composed of investigators from the University of Minnesota Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR), Stanford University Lucas Center for Imaging, Penn State Center for NMR Research, NYU Center for Biomedical Imaging and Oxford University; together they bring to this project unique experience and track record of accomplishments in high resolution functional and diffusion imaging, ultrahigh magnetic field technology and applications, RF pulse and pulse sequence development, multichannel transmit technology, gradient design and construction, manufacturing and use of novel dielectric materials, RF coil design and construction, and image reconstruction and post- processing."
"9446400","Usability remains a significant barrier to broader adoption of cutting-edge bioinformatics tools, due to a lack of user-friendly web interfaces. The Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) provides standards-based software components from which web-facing genome databases can be quickly assembled. JBrowse, the genome browser of GMOD, aims to democratize genome informatics by making genome annotations and sequence analysis tools more accessible to the broader community of biologists, using JavaScript and the dynamic web. JBrowse is now in active use by thousands of websites and tens of thousands of users. In this phase of the project, we plan to build a synteny browser into JBrowse, so that users can rapidly navigate between related genomes, view evolutionarily conserved gene structures and their associated alignments, and visualize genome annotations in their phylogenetic context. This synteny browser will have the same responsiveness and interactivity as JBrowse, with smooth panning, zooming, filtering, sorting, and searching available as drag-and-drop operations from within the web browser. We will also significantly improve JBrowse's performance at scale: many JBrowse instances have hundreds or thousands of tracks, demanding efficiency optimizations, more compact visualization, and user interface enhancements to promote data discoverability. We will develop a graphical interface for customizing JBrowse, configuring its appearance and behavior, and installing plugins, in the style of the Wordpress blog platform. We will build on the newly-developed JBrowse analysis server to make standard read-to-reference alignment tools (BWA and BowTie) available to users from within the browser, and we will make new visualizations available for RNA-Seq, population genomics, epigenomics, and other data types. Finally, we will continue GMOD's outreach/helpdesk efforts with focused workshops, training materials, and documentation to maximize the utility of GMOD/JBrowse to the broader community. "
"9468318","Recent studies demonstrate that the hypothalamus functions as a high-order ?control center of aging?, counteracting age-associated pathophysiological changes and thereby promoting longevity in mammals. Our group demonstrated that the mammalian NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1 in the hypothalamus, particularly the dorsomedial and lateral hypothalamic nuclei (DMH and LH, respectively), is critical to counteract age-associated physiological decline and promote longevity in mice. In the DMH, SIRT1 and its binding partner Nkx2-1 highly colocalize, allowing us to identify a specific subset of DMH neurons, namely, SIRT1/Nkx2-1-double positive neurons. Recently, we have identified a set of genes specifically expressed in these SIRT1/Nkx2-1-double positive DMH neurons. One of these genes is Prdm13, which encodes a member of the PR domain family of transcriptional regulators. Prdm13 is one of the downstream target genes regulated by SIRT1 and Nkx2-1 in the DMH. DMH-specific Prdm13-knockdown mice exhibit decreased sleep quality, increased adiposity, and reduction in adipose Nampt, a key systemic NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme secreted from adipose tissue to remotely regulate hypothalamic function. On the other hand, we found that the DMH- specific knockdown of the thyrotoropin-releasing hormone (Trh) gene, another gene highly and selectively expressed in the SIRT1/Nkx2-1-double positive DMH neurons, caused defects in skeletal muscle mitochondrial gene expression, specific myokine expression, and physical activity. These results suggest that SIRT1/Nkx2-1-double positive DMH neurons contain at least two functionally distinct neuronal subpopulations, namely, Prdm13- and Trh-positive neurons, and that each subpopulation regulates distinct inter-tissue feedback loops between the hypothalamus and adipose tissue or skeletal muscle. In this research proposal, we will extensively investigate the physiological importance of these two inter-tissue feedback loops. We will also examine whether maintaining the activity of these feedback loops can counteract age-associated pathophysiological changes and possibly extend lifespan in mice. The anticipated outcome from the proposed research will make a significant impact to our understanding of the systemic regulation of aging and longevity in mammals."
"9593619","Abstract Neural circuit function requires synaptic inhibition mediated by ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Glutamine is the major metabolic precursor for neuronal GABA synthesis and is supplied to neurons via the activity of the astrocyte-specific enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS). Inhibition or brain-specific genetic ablation of GS leads to impaired GABAergic inhibition, intractable epilepsy, and death. Consistent with this, deficits in GS expression are found in the brains of patients and animal models of epilepsy. Deficits in GS levels have also been reported in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Despite the critical role GS plays in neuronal physiology there have been no systematic studies to evaluate how GS activity is regulated in the mammalian brain to meet the demand of neurons for glutamine. GS structure is highly conserved through evolution, but all mammalian isoforms contain unique amino acids that are potential substrates for phosphorylation which are adjacent to, or within the catalytic site of this enzyme. These residues include threonine residue 301 (T301) and serine residue 343 (S343), which are consensus sites for a phosphorylation by a variety of classical 2nd messenger dependent protein kinases including cAMP-dependent (PKA) kinase. However, it remains to be determined if GS is a phospho-protein in the brain and if this covalent modification impacts on enzyme activity and/or stability. To address this issue, we will use stable isotope labeling of amino acids in culture (SILAC) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC- MS/MS) to 1) identify sites of phosphorylation, and 2) quantify their stoichiometry of phosphorylation under basal conditions and after the activation of PKA in situ, in vitro and in vivo. To complement our LC-MS/MS studies we will use recently developed phospho-specific antibodies to further analyze GS phosphorylation. In parallel, we will assess the effects phosphorylation have on GS activity and stability. Finally, we will determine if seizure activity induced by chemico-convulsants modifies GS phosphorylation and activity in the mouse brain. Preliminary studies have allowed us to formulate a central hypothesis that will be tested in this proposal; GS activity is inhibited by PKA-dependent phosphorylation of T301/S343, and enhanced phosphorylation of these residues contributes to the deficits in GS activity seen during epilepsy. Our proposal will center on the following specific aims: Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that PKA mediated phosphorylation of GS leads to decreased enzyme activity. Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that ?phospho-dependent? inactivation of GS is enhanced by seizure like activity. Collectively these studies will provide the first evidence of the mechanism by which astrocytes regulate GS activity. Therefore, they may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to increase GS activity to alleviate the burdens of epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders."
"9456210","Regulatory T cells (Treg) are fundamental components of the immune system, preventing the occurrence of many immune-related diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and allergies. Natural Foxp3+ Treg cells are selected in the thymus; it is believed that Treg cells are induced through interactions between their T cell receptor (TCR) and high affinity thymus ligands (agonists) in the presence of a permissive cytokine environment. The process is often referred to as agonist selection. Despite the importance of knowing how to induce Treg cells, a natural thymic ligand (agonist) that induces Treg cell development has never been identified. In this application, we seek to identify the first natural thymus ligand of a Treg cell. We will identify the thymic ligand of the 2P24 Treg, which is a typical natural Treg cell. We will approach this goal by taking advantage of two properties that the agonist of 2P24 Treg cells has. One, that 2P24 TCR recognizes a ligand expressed in the epidermis, and two, that the expression of the selecting ligand of 2P24 cells in the thymus is dependent on an intact Aire gene. When 2P24 mice were crossed with Foxp3-deficient mice, they developed a severe skin inflammation, and no other detectable pathology. Furthermore, epidermis lysates from normal mice and primary cultured keratinocytes could stimulate 2P24 cells, but lysates from five other tissues could not. Regarding Aire, the number of thymic 2P24 Treg cells was reduced by more than 90% in 2P24 Aire KO mice. We used bioinformatics to define the list of potential gene(s) encoding the 2P24 ligand, thus helping us to prioritize the search. By combining the two properties (epidermal expression and Aire-dependency) we have narrowed the list of candidates to a very manageable 21 genes. We have set up an assay in which epidermal cells lysates, but not lysates from other tissues, stimulate 2P24 immature cells when presented by splenic antigen-presenting cells (APC) or bone marrow-derived APC. The identification of the 2P24 thymic Treg ligand will be developed in two specific aims. In the first aim, we will identify the epidermal gene that stimulates 2P24 T cells, by using a combination of loss of function and gain of function approaches. We will use CRISPR- mediated elimination of specific genes in primary cultured epidermal cells, and, as a gain of function, we will express the candidate genes in cells that normally don't express it, subsequently allowing antigen presentation by APC expressing the selecting MHC allele, and assessing 2P24 T cell reactivity. In the second aim, we will eliminate the gene identified in aim 1 specifically in medullary thymus epithelium, as well as induce 2P24 Treg cell differentiation by intrathymic injection of the agonistic 2P24 peptide. This peptide should not induce Treg cell differentiation of a Treg with different TCR, A12, for example. Overall, this application tests key hypotheses on the limiting agonist model of Treg cell development. Success in the identification of the 2P24 agonist will allow key follow up experiments, for the first time using defined peptides that induce natural Treg cell in the thymus."
"9487151","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insufficiency or defectiveness of type I collagen is the cause of osteogenesis imperfect (OI), an inherited disorder characterized by abnormal bone development with an increased lifetime risk of fractures. Exome sequencing of a family presenting with OI phenotypes ranging from mild with few fractures to prenatal lethality revealed a mutation in CREB3L1, encoding a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor. CREB3L1 has been reported once before in association with OI but the disease mechanism is still unclear. Collagen proteins are quite large and their transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi for packaging and eventual secretion is achieved using specialized secretory machinery. A closely related protein to CREB3L1, CREB3L2, has a role in regulating one such pathway in chondrocytes and is important for proper cartilage formation. Impaired functionality of CREB3L1 due to mutation may perturb the same or a related pathway in osteoblasts and lead to reduced type I collagen in bone, explaining the OI. There is also evidence that CREB3L1 operates in cell-type specific physiological ER stress pathways that may contribute to the phenotype. Fibroblasts from the proband are available but do not express CREB3L1. CREB3L1-associated OI will be modeled using both induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived osteoblasts from patient cells bearing the deletion and zebrafish engineered with the family mutation. These models will be used to look for evidence of the impaired secretion that is hypothesized and to define the role of CREB3L1 in various pathways that operate during bone development. Both models will serve as confirmation of CREB3L1 as an OI disease gene and potentially as tools for the design of new drugs or treatments for brittle bone disease."
"9480674","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 5 million older Americans currently suffer from Alzheimer's disease and related dementias with 80% receiving care in the community by 15 million informal caregivers (CGs) providing unpaid care.1 Dementia is associated with high health care costs, long term care (LTC) placement, medical complications, reduced quality of life, and CG burden. Patient and family centric care models tailored to dementia that address the multidimensional aspects of dementia management, and link health and community care are understudied but may represent a promising mechanism to address the multiple and on-going needs of this growing population, reduce adverse outcomes such as premature LTC placement, and produce cost benefits. We propose a definitive Phase III efficacy trial to test Maximizing Independence at Home-Streamlined (MIND-S), a home- based, care coordination intervention for community-living PWD and their informal CGs that builds on pilot work. In a pilot trial, MIND was successfully implemented in a diverse sample of 303 community-living individuals with memory disorders and was found to be acceptable to CGs, led to delays in time to transition from home, improved PWD QOL, and CG time savings.73,78 We now propose a 24-month, prospective, single- blind, parallel group, RCT evaluating MIND-S in a cohort of 300 community-living PWD and their informal CGs in the Greater Baltimore area. Intervention dyads will receive 18 months of care coordination by an interdisciplinary team comprised of trained non-clinical community workers (Interventionists), a psychiatric nurse, and geriatric psychiatrist. The intervention involves 4 key components: identification of needs and individualized care planning (PWD and CG needs); dementia education and skill building; coordination, referral and linkage of services; and care monitoring. Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of MIND-S on time to long term care (LTC) placement or death at 18 months and 24 months (6 months post treatment). Aim 2: To estimate MIND-S cost and assess whether it results in net financial benefits by conducting a cost-offset analysis taking the societal perspective at 18 months and 24 months (6 months post treatment). Aim 3: To determine the efficacy of MIND-S on PWD unmet care needs, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), and quality of life (QOL), and on CG unmet needs and burden at 18 and 24 months (6 months post treatment). Exploratory aims: To explore whether the moderators and mediators of the intervention's effect on time to LTC or death. This proposal brings together an internationally and nationally recognized group of researchers with complimentary expertise in community-based dementia care, clinical trials, health economics, and biostatistics. If proven efficacious and cost efficient, the MIND-S model has the potential to change how dementia care services are provided and coordinated at the community level and serve as a national model. It is responsive to the National Alzheimer's Plan Act (Public Law 111-375) calling for development and testing of new comprehensive models of dementia care."
"9623549","Project Summary/Abstract Replication and pathogenesis of any virus within a human host is dependent on how well the virus is able to bypass the many defense systems of the immune system. In particular, Type I Interferons are cytokines that induce the quintessential anti-viral systems within a human. All known viruses that cause disease in humans have systems to circumvent detection and/or action of this potent cytokine. We have sought to determine if and how HIV is able to ?hide? from these systems. We have found that HIV can block both the induction of Type I Interferon as well as the induction of an antiviral state caused by Type I Interferon. We propose to determine how these proteins work to subvert the innate immune response by manipulating the Type I Interferon systems. The significance of these studies will be in creating a more complete understanding of the interaction between HIV and the innate immune system and better understand how to use Type I Interferon in a therapeutic approach to controlling HIV infection. This R15 proposal is a key step in strengthening research opportunities for our laboratory and students that are interested in training in biomedical science research."
"9578747","Project Summary/Abstract The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand induction and effector mechanisms of immunity in the absence of signaling adaptor MyD88. We use as a tool the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, an orally acquired opportunistic pathogen that normally induces strong protective Th1- and IFN-?-based immunity. Toxoplasma can activate mouse immunity through an MyD88-dependent TLR11/12 pathway. Yet, humans lack these TLR and populations deficient in MyD88 expression retain resistance to all but a limited number of bacterial infections. Therefore, immune pathways that do not involve MyD88 are important to understand. We have found that MyD88 knockout mice are capable of generating Th1-like immunity during Toxoplasma infection, indicating that alternative pathways for immune initiation are active in the mouse model. In addition, MyD88 knockout animals can be vaccinated against lethal infection with orally inoculated T. gondii. The cell and molecular mechanisms underpinning MyD88-independent immunity are uncharacterized. The central hypothesis driving this research proposal is that the mouse immune system is equipped to generate protective immunity to Toxoplasma using MyD88-independent pathways of resistance. We more generally hypothesize that this is important for understanding human disease based upon overall resistance to infections in the absence of MyD88. Three Specific Aims will be used to understand MyD88-independent immunity during infection. Aim 1: Determine how T cells are activated in the absence of MyD88 signaling in the mucosal response to Toxoplasma. We will investigate cytokine requirements for MyD88-independent generation of IFN-?-positive T cells and characterize the phenotype and specificity of these cells. Aim 2: Determine the impact of MyD88 deficiency on gut microbicidal effector functions. We will examine how deficiency in this signaling adaptor affects recruitment and function of anti- microbial effector cells in the intestinal mucosa following Toxoplasma infection. Aim 3: Determine how vaccination with an avirulent Toxoplasma strain triggers MyD88-independent protective immunity in the intestinal mucosa. We will employ a nonproliferating Toxoplasma strain to determine how T. gondii induces resistance to lethal oral challenge in a model where immunity can be triggered without complications associated with parasite-induced tissue damage. The importance of this research is that it will significantly extend and deepen our understanding of induction and effector mechanisms of immunity in the absence of MyD88, which is critical to understanding host defense in humans. The ultimate impact of this research is that it can be expected to identify novel parasite and host targets for promoting resistance and immunity during infectious disease."
"9592577","Abstract Zika virus (ZIKV) is primarily a mosquito-transmitted virus but the concerns regarding sexual transmission has gained urgency as the alarming increase in the number of cases of microcephaly in ZIKV-infected women in the 2015-2016 global epidemic coincided with the detection of the virus in the semen. Recent reports of ZIKV in human seminal fluid for months after the clearance of viremia in as high as 56% of infected men together with low sperm count suggest the ability of ZIKV to enter into the immune privilege compartment of the testes and establish persistent infection. Lack of any specific therapeutic drugs to clear testicular infection and appropriate animal model to mimic human testicular ZIKV infection has brought an urgent need for the development of human in vitro systems to understand the associated mechanisms of persistence. Human testes immune environment is tightly governed by an elaborate communication network between different resident cell types including Sertoli cells (SCs) and Leydig cells (LCs) that produce key cytokines (TGF-? and TNF-?) and hormones (testosterone, inhibin and activin) required for the maintaining local immune homeostasis and supporting germ cells differentiation. Our recent study demonstrated that ZIKV infection of primary human SCs is more robust than Dengue virus (DENV), modulates pathways involved in innate immune response and SC-germ cells network thus suggesting that ZIKV may affect the function of seminiferous epithelium and antiviral response. We have recently developed a human 3D testicular organoid (HTO) culture system using cells present in the interstitial space (testosterone producing LCs) and seminiferous tubules (SCs, peritubular cells and spermatogonia stem cells) that supports differentiation of germ cells. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that ZIKV can productively infect these HTOs. This study will address the hypothesis that multiple human testicular cells support robust infection of ZIKV and that these HTOs can be used as a novel model system to assess the cell tropism of the virus and alterations in the key pathways uniquely associated with testicular immune response and germ cell survival. In the aim 1, we will determine replication kinetics of ZIKV, WNV and DENV and effect on overall HTO integrity, cell death and fate of spermatogonia stem cells. Aim 2 will determine the association of cell-type specific immune response pathways with levels of virus transcripts and testicular hormones in each partner cell. Our group is uniquely positioned to establish this multicellular 3D HTOs as a novel tool to delineate the mechanisms of ZIKV in testicular cells because of our expertise in the field of flavivirus immunity, organoid and germ cells culture. The data from this study will fill the fundamental gap of cell types that support long-term infection of ZIKV in the testes and open up opportunities to use HTOs for future mechanistic and translational studies including screening of anti-viral drugs to clear testes infection."
"9470888","PROJECT SUMMARY: PROTEIN CORE The Protein Core provides the technology, infrastructure and expertise required for the high-throughput production of protein reagents to support the Ligand Discovery, Structure Determination and Functional Annotation goals of the Program Project. The Protein Core will generate ~450 proteins per annum (native and seleno-methionine substituted, as needed) for function and structure. Initial efforts will focus on the production of Solute Binding Proteins (SBPs) and Ligand-responsive Transcriptional Regulators. Efforts will also include ?pathway-related? enzymes, as required for confirmation of metabolic pathway prediction by the Metabolism and Modeling Projects. The Protein Core will exploit its great flexibility to respond to the changing needs of the Program Project by providing access to the widest range of required proteins. This includes the generation of oxygen sensitive proteins involved in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism by exploiting the world's first integrated system for high-throughput functional and structural biology of oxygen sensitive proteins, a recapitulation of our entire high-throughput protein production and crystallization pipeline within an oxygen-free environment. In summary, we established a world class protein production resource which has supported the high- throughput structural, DSF, activity-based screening and functional assay requirements for a number of large- scale research programs and which will continue to do so for this Program Project."
"9487827","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to investigate the role of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) in the cellular pathways associated with alterations of membrane molecular order and membrane tethering adhesion mechanics in amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta)-stimulated cerebral endothelial cells (CECs). Membrane tethering adhesion is the first mechanical step governing the transmigration of monocytes across the endothelial layer; thus, increased microglial cells in brains differentiated from peripheral monocytes exacerbate the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this project, we will test the hypothesis that Ab stimulates CECs and results in activation of cPLA2 and its upstream mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) which play a critical role in the increase in adhesion molecules, p-selectin, through the nuclear factor-kB (NFkB) pathway, and subsequently enhanced actin polymerization, and alteration of the molecular order of cell membranes, and membrane tether adhesion mechanics..  This project will be accomplished by biochemical, biophysical, and biomechanical approaches. Biochemical approaches include cell reporter assay to measure NFkB, Western blot analysis to characterize activation of MAPKs and cPLA2 and quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy (QIM) to quantify reactive oxygen species, adhesion molecules (p-selectin), and actin polymerization in Abeta-stimulated CECs. For the biophysical approach, fluorescence microscopy of LAURDAN will be applied to examine the role of MAPKs and cPLA2 on membrane molecular order in Abeta-stimulated CECs. For the biomechanical approach, atomic force microscopy will be used to determine the role of MAPKs, cPLA2, and NFkB in alterations of cell membrane adhesion in Abeta-stimulated CECs.  Results derived from this project will fill the gap in the field by providing the mechanism for involvement of cPLA2 activation and the relationship between Abeta-induced cPLA2-related pathway and membrane tether adhesion mechanics in CECs. Since membrane tether adhesion is a determining mechanical step for transmigration of monocytes, and monocytes can further differentiate into microglial cells which exacerbate oxidation and neuro-inflammation conditions in AD brains, this project is expected to contribute to our understanding of the oxidation and inflammation in AD brains. Ultimately, information derived from this project will provide new insights into therapeutic strategies for AD treatment and progression of the disease."
"9473568","ABSTRACT Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic and relapsing condition for which current pharmacological treatments are only modestly effective. The development of efficacious medications for AUD remains a high research priority with recent emphasis on identifying novel molecular targets for AUD treatment and to efficiently screen new compounds aimed at those targets. Ibudilast (IBUD) has been advanced as a novel addiction pharmacotherapy that targets neurotrophin signaling and neuroimmune function. IBUD inhibits phosphodiesterases -4 (PDE4) and -10 (PDE10) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor. To advance medications development for AUD, our laboratory has recently completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover laboratory study of IBUD in non-treatment seeking individuals with current AUD (R21 AA022214; NCT02025998). This study tested the safety, tolerability, and initial human laboratory efficacy of IBUD (50mg BID). Results indicated that IBUD was well tolerated and associated with mood improvements during stress- and alcohol-cue exposures as well as reductions in tonic levels of alcohol craving. Building upon the strong rationale and preclinical findings for IBUD, along with safety data and early efficacy in human testing conducted in our laboratory, this proposal seeks to conduct a 12-week, double-blind, placebo controlled randomized clinical trial of IBUD (50mg BID). We propose to randomize 132 treatment-seeking men and women with current AUD. The primary aims are (a) to test whether IBUD (50mg BID) will decrease percent heavy drinking days (PHDD; HDD defined as 5+ drinks for men and 4+ for women), as compared to placebo, over the course of the 12-week trial; and (b) to test the efficacy of IBUD (50mg BID) on secondary alcohol consumption endpoints, namely (a) drinks per day, (b) drinks per drinking day, (c) percent days abstinent, (d) percent subjects with no heavy drinking days, and (e) percent subjects abstinent, as well as measures of alcohol craving and negative mood, over the course of the 12-week trial. The successful completion of the proposed study will further develop IBUD, a safe and promising novel compound with strong preclinical and safety data for AUD. If IBUD proves superior to placebo in this study, it will set the stage for a confirmatory multi-site trial leading to FDA approval of a novel AUD treatment."
"9477440","PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal, entitled ?Pleiotropy GWAS of Alzheimer's Disease and Multiple Neurodegenerative Diseases,? describes plans to analyze existing neurodegenerative phenotype and genome-wide genotype data from existing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), among others. While neurodegenerative diseases have distinct pathologies, there are also shared pathological features like protein aggregation in the brain (e.g., tau protein). This suggests that genetic studies combining neurodegenerative disease genetics studies may identify genetic risk factors contributing to one or more individual NDs (?pleiotropy?) through these common features. The goal of these planned analyses is to identify genetic loci and variants with effects across multiple NDs. Our approach includes broad hypothesis-free analyses like GWAS meta-analysis, as well as targeted ?drill-down? approaches like pathway analyses examining known biological pathways. These analyses will use publicly available data on genome-wide association study and whole genome/exome sequence datasets curated by individual groups, disease-specific consortia, and on the NIH Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). This project will require extensive collection of genotypes from well-characterized cases and controls; systematic archiving of case-control and prospective cohort studies; a formally-structured data harmonization process; inclusion of multiethnic GWAS and WGS/WES studies; and longitudinal analyses in cohort studies of neurodegeneration in order to fulfill the mandate of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) RFA PAR-15-356. Our three aims include (1) harmonization and integration of genotype and phenotype data from multiple large-scale genetic studies of differeing neurodegenerative diseases; (2) estimating shared heritability between neurodegenerative diseases and performing GWAS and WGS/WES association study meta-analyses; and (3) performing analyses of intermediate and related phenotypes and incorporating functional annotation to identify truly functional pleiotropic variants and their causal effects on multiple neurodegenerative diseases. These analyses will examine both common and rare genomic variants and will use a similar strategy to existing genetic studies comparing neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g, schizophrenia, depression), with refinement and development of novel pleiotropy methods. We will leverage our considerable experience with large-scale genetic association and meta-analysis studies to identify new genetic risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases using data on tens of thousands of affected and unaffected individuals. Furthermore, we will create an online resource for data harmonization and sharing analysis results with investigators interested in shared genetic risk factors of neurodegeneration."
"9536968","The premise of this research is that: (1) both early life stress (ELS) and recent stressors increase risk for a wide range of mental disorders including major depressive disorder, but many people are resilient to both; and (2) micro RNAs (miRNAs) mediate shorter- and longer-term effects of environmental stressors on gene expression and cell function. The effects of both ELS and recent stressors involve the induction of shorter- and longer-term coordinated changes across networks of genes, mRNAs, and proteins. miRNAs are a subclass of non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression via post-transcriptional mechanisms. miRNAs are responsive to environmental cues and function as transducers of environmental effects on gene expression. Further, single miRNAs can regulate a range of mRNA translation and tend to effect coordinated networks of genes. In addition, miRNAs are subject to epigenetic regulation. There is strong evidence that brain miRNAs are responsive to environmental stressors, and that they are adaptively regulated by early life stress. miRNAs directly and indirectly regulate components of both stress response (e.g., glucocorticoid receptor, corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1) and neuroplasticity (e.g., BDNF), and regulate stress- and fear-related neural mechanisms such as fear conditioning, extinction memory, and fear memory consolidation. However, there has been no research on the effects of either acute stress or ELS on miRNA expression in humans. Exosomes containing both miRNAs and mRNAs are released into the peripheral circulation. Using specific surface markers, we have successfully isolated neural-derived blood exosomes, which are enriched with miRNAs expressed in brain. The proposed study aims to examine the involvement of neural-specific exosomal miRNAs in both acute stress response and longer-term processes associated with ELS. Our primary outcome will compare people with either PTSD or major depression (MDD) with a history of ELS (that we will combine into an ELS-stress sensitive group [ELS-SS]) with a group of people with ELS but no history of mental disorder (ELS-SS). Participants will undergo an acute experimental stress, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST); blood will be drawn at baseline and at times 0, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min following the test. miRNA sequencing will be conducted on the baseline and TSST+15 min samples and ELS-SS and ELS-SR groups will be compared. We anticipate that: (1) there will be significant differences between ELS-SS and ELS-SR groups in miRNA expression; (2) the TSST will alter the expression of set of neural-derived exosomal miRNAs that regulate components of neuroplasticity and stress response, which will be differentially expressed in ELS-SS and ELS- SR groups; (3) the alterations in miRNAs will be associated with differential methylation of miRNA sequences. This pilot and feasibility project has a high likelihood of leading to research that will change our understanding of how the environment modulates stress response, and why some people are sensitive to stress while others with similar stressors are resilient. This may lead to the development of novel treatments or prevention."
"9677930","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiomyocytes undergo remodeling in response to pathological stimuli, causing altered cell morphology, increased protein synthesis and upregulation of fetal genes. While initially compensatory, ultimately, these changes prove maladaptive, inducing fibrosis and adverse ventricular remodeling. In response to cardiac stress and/or injury, activation of the Ras-related small G protein RhoA was previously shown to mediate deleterious in vivo pathological responses. However, more recently, RhoA has also been shown to promote cell survival and be cardio-protective after myocardial infarct (MI) injury. To determine the molecular mechanisms that underlie these opposing roles for RhoA in the myocardium, we generated mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of RhoA (RhoAfl/fl-aMHC-Cre). In response to chronic injury (transverse aortic constriction, TAC), we found that hearts from RhoAfl/fl-aMHC-Cre mice developed an accelerated dilation, with significant loss of contractile function. Despite this, and in parallel, hearts from these mice also showed significantly decreased cardiac fibrosis, with a demonstrated decrease in transcriptional activation of genes involved in the fibrotic response, including the serum response factor (SRF) and the myocardin related transcription factor (MRTF). Taken together, our data suggest that RhoA serves as a critical bi-nodal point in response to cardiac injury, whereby a component of the downstream signaling is required to preserve contractility, while the other mediates activation of maladaptive responses due to activation of profibrotic genes. Therefore, we hypothesize that targeted inhibition of downstream RhoA-mediated pro-fibrotic genes (SRF and MRTF) will not only prevent onset of fibrosis and subsequent maladaptive responses associated with MI injury, but will also allow for the preservation of the upstream cardio-protective effects n contractility exerted by RhoA parallel signaling pathways.  Nanomaterials have found wide applicability in the treatment of disease, as they possess the ability to modulate the properties o drugs, including circulation times and localization to tissues of interest. Importantly, the incorporation of therapeutic moieties within targeted nanoparticles allows for their site-specific delivery, minimizing the dose required to bring about a therapeutic effect, while concomitantly decreasing systemic repercussions. Using this technology, we will investigate novel targeting ligands for the cell specific delivery of inhibitors of cardiac fibrosis following myocardial injur. Using in-vivo, ex-vivo and in-vitro analyses, we will 1) generate and fully characterize targeted nanoagents incorporating inhibitors chosen to prevent the deposition of collagen after MI; 2) examine the in vitro and in vivo binding and inhibitory efficacy of the synthesized nanoagents; and 3) longitudinally assess the therapeutic efficacy of the targeted delivery of inhibitors in murine models of MI. Importantly, we expect that the efficacy of this technology to extend beyond MI, and be applicable to more chronic conditions, such as fibrosis caused by cardiac hypertrophy and/or valvular disease."

"9509536","This proposal aims to integrate two streams of research on learning and memory in an attempt to strengthen the links between theory and experiment, build models that explain experimental observations and use model predictions to guide new experiments. The experimental stream will record neuronal population activity in inferior temporal, perirhinal and prefrontal cortices during performance of delayed matching tasks which require maintenance of visual information in short term memory, using visual stimuli with various degrees of familiarity (from entirely novel to highly familiar). The modeling stream will investigate learning and memory in network models that include learning rules inferred from data, using a combination of mean field analysis and simulation. Models will generate predictions on patterns of delay period activity that will be tested using experimental data. The goals of this combined experimental and theoretical project will be to answer the following questions: · How do changes in synaptic connectivity induced by learning due to repeated presentation of a particular stimulus affect the distributions of visual responses of neurons? In other words, how do neuronal representations change in cortex as a novel stimulus becomes familiar? Can we infer the learning rule in cortical circuits from experimentally observed changes in distributions of neuronal responses as the stimuli become familiar? · Do changes in synaptic connectivity induced by learning rules that are consistent with the statistics of visual responses lead to delay period activity in a task such as the OMS task? Is delay period activity already present upon the first presentation of a stimulus, or does it develop over time? If it is not present during the initial presentations, how is sample information maintained in memory during the delayed match to sample task? see attached continuation RELEVANCE (See instructions): See attached"

"9479163","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is to develop and support three state-of-the-art optical instruments that provide microscopic access to the living retina, and use them to obtain a clearer understanding of how the human visual system works. They will be used to answer questions about the most important and the most challenging region in the retina to study, the fovea. The instruments are built upon two key technical strengths - adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) systems and accurate, high-speed eye-motion tracking. Adaptive optics (AO) technology corrects the imperfections in the eye and can be used to generate microscopic views of the living retina. AO also enables the delivery of ultra-sharp images to the retina. Eye tracking is used to measure and compensate for ever-present eye motion. Together, these allow for accurate visualization, tracking and delivery of light to retinal features as small as single cone photoreceptors, enabling measurements of properties of spatial and color vision on an unprecedented scale. Although the three systems will be identical and will be used to test vision on a cellular scale, the scope of study for each system will be very different. The AOSLO at the University of Alabama, Birmingham will be used to test vision in primates, the AOSLO at the University of California, Berkeley will be used to perform advanced vision testing on healthy human eyes, and the AOSLO at the University of California, San Francisco will be used to study patients with eye disease. The key advantage of having the BRP manage three identical systems is that it will facilitate hardware innovations plus rapid translation of knowledge and innovative testing from animal models to the clinic. Briefly, the specific aims are: Aim 1: Develop and deploy state-of-the-art AOSLO systems at each site. Demonstrate performance by performing objective densitometry measures in monkeys and humans to map the three classes of cone photoreceptor that subserve color vision. Aim 2: Develop improved eye tracking and stimulus delivery capabilities in each system. Confirm performance by using subjective psychophysical tests to map the same three classes of cone photoreceptor as in Aim 1. Aim 3: Perform a series of experiments in monkeys and humans to map the connections and interactions within and between the retina and the brain and to study how we see the world as stable even though our eyes are in constant motion. Aim 4: Apply advanced vision testing methods in the clinic to discover mechanisms for cone death in different diseases, to monitor changes in cone function and structure during disease progression and to test the efficacy of treatments that aim to stop or slow disease progression. Aim 5: Make eye tracking and targeted stimulus delivery capabilities accessible to a wider audience by providing software, hardware designs and a forum for anyone interesting in building similar advanced systems."
"9691550","The Carolina Biomedical Data Translator (CBDT) will address the significant challenges in clinical and translational research by permitting clinicians, nurses, biomedical researchers, and clinical scientists to query, exploit, and contribute to a federated collection of complex and highly disparate data with medical importance. This data federation?a ?quasi-comprehensive? medical federation?will enable interrogators to pose questions about human health and disease that could not heretofore have been imagined. We anticipate that these analyses will increase, in ways that are paradigm shifting, our understanding of new treatments and treatment targets, mechanisms of disease and disease transmission, environmental triggers, opportunities for drug repurposing, molecular candidates, and systems biology pathways. To realize this vision, we propose a trajectory that permits the realization of such a federation. We intend to start modestly and prototype the CBDT using the unique tools we have been building for other informatics projects, and then iteratively improve the CBDT in collaboration with NCATS. Ultimately, the CBDT federation will need to be socialized, permitted, and nurtured in order to realize its full potential. Indeed, we believe that the biggest single challenge will be establishing a governance model that permits the assembly of information pulled from across institutions and organizations. We discuss this issue in Section 2.2.1. The CBDT must be: ? Dynamic: regularly updated to accommodate the addition of new data and data sources; ? Agile: modifiable for uses beyond the original design and adaptable for other data analysis; ? Usable: permitting differential access and levels of access (view, edit, etc.) to the data, and permitting use by both experts and new users with modest training; ? Rational: the data will be clinically and scientifically relevant, as well as informed by policy and protocols, and the system will provide answers with contextual meta-data; and ? Curated: the data will have associated provenance and quality measures, including statistical relevance where appropriate. We envision a dynamic system that supports data ingestion and subsequent curation, federation, and exploitation (see figure). We have assembled a team that has a track record of interdisciplinary collaboration and development of open source tools. We propose a demonstration project that is feasible in the 2-year time frame, but demonstrates all of the key functionality that the final system must possess."
"9458191","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Older adult drivers with glaucoma are at a high risk for being at-fault in motor vehicle collisions, causing injury or death to themselves or others.  However, the types of driving errors that place these individuals at risk and the relationship between their driving errors and their clinical profiles remain unclear.  To address this need, we will study 125 drivers with varying severity of glaucoma and 55 control (non-glaucoma) drivers using an on-road driving test to assess driving behaviors in an objective, standardized, individualized, and real-life manner.  Driving behavior will be measured by an in-car driving evaluator and a 2-camera telemetry system with modern sensors.  A comprehensive clinical assessment of vision (e.g peripheral visual field loss) and non-vision (e.g cognition and mobility) factors associated with driving safety will be obtained to help characterize the relationship between these factors and driving errors.  The Specific Aims are to:  1) Identify the type and frequency of at-risk driving errors in glaucoma patients; 2) Determine vision and non-vision factors associated with at-risk driving errors in glaucoma patients; and 3) Identify effective compensatory strategies used by safe glaucoma drivers.  A multidisciplinary team of experts (in glaucoma, gerontology, driving and low vision rehabilitation, instrumentation, epidemiology, and statistics) will provide integration of the multifactorial nature of safe and unsafe driving behavir in glaucoma patients.  Multivariate methods will be used to develop a parsimonious model of vision and non-vision factors associated with driving errors.  The expected outcome from this innovative project is to have identified 1.  vision factors associated with at-risk driving errors n glaucoma patients that are amenable to interventions and 2.  effective compensatory strategies currently used by safe glaucoma drivers.  These two pieces of critical information will provide a foundation for defining interventions and designing studies to improve safety for glaucoma drivers.  The long-term goal of our research is to develop and implement evidence-based vision rehabilitation programs to facilitate and prolong safe driving in older adults with glaucoma.  Overall, these outcomes are anticipated to have an important public health benefit by reducing the risk of driving with glaucoma which will minimize morbidity and mortality and promote a sense of independence and overall well-being in older adults with glaucoma"
"9537260","SUMMARY The corpus luteum (CL) is a transient endocrine gland whose structure and function are regulated by both luteotrophic factors that stimulate luteal function and luteolytic factors that inhibit luteal function. The CL is the primary source of progesterone during estrous or menstrual cycles and early pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur, timely regression of the CL is required to resume normal estrous or menstrual cycles. The single most important factor involved in regulating the secretion of progesterone in the CL, irrespective of species, is luteinizing hormone (LH). This pituitary gonadotropin induces formation of the CL, and is capable of extending the functional life span of the CL. Secretion of progesterone is absolutely required for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy and inadequate progesterone secretion contributes to early pregnancy loss in women and cattle, the two model systems employed in this project. Female reproduction is affected by obesity and it is estimated that over half of reproductive age women are overweight or obese. Recent research suggests that weight gain can contribute to impaired function of the primate CL. Recent developments in other fields of research have shed light on the composition and role of intracellular lipid droplets (LD) as significant contributors to metabolic events and disease states. These understudied organelles are prominent components of steroidogenic cells but almost nothing is known about their role in the ovary and specifically their role in luteal function. A deeper understanding of the metabolic regulation of the CL has important implications for improving fertility. Lipid droplets accumulate during CL formation, presumptively for storage of the steroid precursor, cholesterol, and cellular energy in the form of fatty acids. Our preliminary data indicate that the lipid droplet may serve as a signaling platform for steroidogenesis and metabolism in the luteal cell. Furthermore the lipid droplet appears to be differentially regulated by luteotrophic and luteolytic hormones. There is a gap in our knowledge of the formation, composition, and function of LDs in ovarian steroidogenic cells. This proposal will test the hypothesis that LDs provide a metabolic or hormone-sensitive organelle which can provide cellular energy and/or store and mobilize substrate for progesterone synthesis. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the natural luteolysin PGF2? rapidly disrupts LD dynamics in vivo resulting in an acute inhibition of steroidogenesis. The project will employ state-of-the-art lipidomics and proteomics analysis to examine LDs and metabolic events driven by LH or PGF2? in bovine luteal cells and human granulosa-luteal cells. Our long-term objectives are to fully understand the cellular mechanisms of action of gonadotropins and the regulation of fertility. The short-term goals of this research are to discover new signaling events initiated by LH and PGF2? and to determine how these novel mechanisms contribute to innovative strategies for enhancing progesterone synthesis. The project will provide novel basic knowledge (derived from lipidomics and proteomic approaches) about ovarian lipid droplets and cellular metabolic events that are expected to advance a major conceptual breakthrough about the mechanisms controlling luteal function."
"9481194","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The suicide rate in the USA is the same as 60 years ago. Better prevention needs more data on risk and resilience biomarkers. We seek to determine both resilience and vulnerability potential endophenotypes for suicide attempts in major depressive disorder (MDD). Both endophenotypes may aid estimation of risk and provide new targets for prevention intervention. The study design compares healthy volunteers (Group 1) with medication-free adult offspring of a parent with MDD and suicidal behavior who are through the age of risk and can thus be divided into a resilient group (Group 4), a group with a diathesis for MDD (Group 2) and one with diatheses for MDD and suicide attempts (Group 3). Comparison of Groups 2 and 3 indicates the diathesis for suicidal behavior. Comparison of Group 1 and 4 indicates the resilience phenotype. Comparison of Group 1 and Group 2 indicates the diathesis for MDD. This study is a new direction based on our almost complete longitudinal two-site follow-up study (PI, J. John Mann, MD, MH056390, Columbia University, NYC and PI, David Brent, MD, MH056612, UPMC, Pittsburgh) of 701 offspring of 334 probands with mood disorder entitled: Familial Pathways to Early-Onset Suicide Attempts that has sought to identify mechanisms by which suicidal behavior risk is transmitted from parent to offspring. Our findings on risk traits in the domains of cognition, mood regulation and stress responses, together with a new domain of brain PET imaging of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor that regulates serotonin release, will focus the search for resilience and vulnerability phenotypes. This study will involve the same two performance sites as the current funded application that ends January 2015. The teams have worked together for >15 years and both teams have conducted PET studies of depressed and suicidal patients. We will recruit eligible offspring from the old study and recruit new offspring as needed for the four groups. Both sites will perform clinical and cognitive assessments, stress tests and PET/MRI scans using identical protocols. The New York site will be the data management site including image analyses and statistics, and assay cortisols."
"9483596","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Anatomical circuitry is the foundation by which information travels within the brain. Therefore, comprehensive wiring diagrams are fundamental for understanding how circuits control complex behavioral and cognitive processes. However, only sparse connectivity datasets exist for mammalian model species, and most are collated from tract tracing literature. This is problematic due to the large variety of methods, targeted areas, nomenclature, and assessment of connection strengths by different labs. Instead, at the Allen Institute, we created an entirely new, standardized, publicly and freely available, dataset (Mouse Connectivity Atlas; ://connectivity.brain-map.org) based on modern anterograde axon tracing and high-throughput 2-photon imaging methods to visualize inter-areal and genetically defined cell type-specific projections across the entire young adult mouse brain from ~300 regions. The Mouse Connectivity Atlas data reveals general organizational principles in healthy brains, but many details are still missing. For example, subclasses of neurons within a region projecting to either single or multiple targets are not always defined, nor are the layers of origin of cortical input neurons to specific targets defined. Higher resolution descriptions of structural connection patterns at the cell type, rather than areal, level will enable more accurate modeling and hypotheses on cortical information processing and cognition in health and disease. In neurodegenerative diseases that rob patients of cognitive abilities, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), pathology spreads in selectively vulnerable regions in specific patterns that resemble, but do not exactly duplicate, network architecture. Taking into account specific cortical projection pathways could thus provide a better structural framework for understanding, predicting, and treating disease. We propose to enhance the Mouse Connectivity Atlas through focused anatomical tracing of whole-brain axon pathways from neurons defined by their projection targets within and outside of disease- relevant large-scale cortical networks. This will be accomplished through the development of a combined viral- based retrograde and anterograde intersectional fluorescent labeling strategy, and our established, successful high-throughput imaging and informatics platform. We will densely survey and map cell type projections defined by target regions in the mouse default mode-like and hippocampal networks, which participate in essential normal cognitive tasks and are vulnerable to AD. New data will be integrated into Allen Institute online resources, providing external users access to raw 2-D images, annotated 3-D projection models, and other analysis tools. We will specifically test the prediction that anatomical classes of projection neurons within an area belonging to the functionally-defined default mode network preferentially connect to other areas within the network. We also propose to use this foundational dataset as a guide for generating and analyzing a brain- wide cell type structural connectivity matrix for an AD mouse model, which could facilitate research in the AD community on disease-related network dysfunction and propagation of pathology."
"9484208","PROJECT SUMMARY Episodic memory decline is a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's Disease. Yet notable declines in memory are also prevalent in the majority of our aging population, which does not meet criteria for dementia. Understanding how memory dysfunction in these non-demented, healthy older adults differs from individuals with (or at risk for) dementia will require further investigation of the neurobiological substrates that contribute to memory in aging, which is the focus of this proposal. Here, we aim to characterize age-related differences in hippocampal white and gray matter microstructure using high-resolution, multi-compartment diffusion imaging. Traditional, single-compartment diffusion imaging studies have predominantly revealed age-related decreases in white matter microstructure, with large age effects in tracts that project to the hippocampus (fornix, perforant path). It remains unclear, however, whether this selective vulnerability of hippocampal white matter to aging can be attributed to distinct neurobiological substrates (axonal degeneration, demyelination). Moreover, single- compartment diffusion imaging is not commonly used to study gray matter because it is not sensitive to neurite (axon, dendrite) structure within this tissue. However, gray matter in the hippocampus exhibits highly organized neurite structure that is suitable for interrogation with multi-compartment diffusion imaging. Relative to single- compartment approaches, multi-compartment diffusion imaging provides more accurate indices of neurite microstructure. Using a high-resolution version of this novel imaging approach, we propose to test whether age differences in hippocampal white (Specific Aim 1) and gray (Specific Aim 1) matter can be attributed to distinct neurobiological substrates that vary by tissue type (axonal degeneration, dendritic de-arborization). We further aim to test whether these more accurate markers of hippocampal aging account for age-related declines in mnemonic processes that rely on the hippocampus (Specific Aim 3). Taken together, this proposal is an important step toward our long-term goal of clarifying the neural substrates being measured using human diffusion imaging by directly relating in vivo and ex vivo assessments of these substrates within the same aged individuals. The proposed study also has the potential to identify a neuroimaging marker that dissociates memory dysfunction in healthy aging versus dementia."
"9432087","PROJECT SUMMARY Drs. Rogovskyy (PI), Stoica (Co-Investigator), Threadgill (Co-Investigator)  Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne illness in North America, is caused by spirochetes of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex (Bb). The estimated incidence of Lyme disease is approximately 300,000 new cases per year (www.cdc.gov). Lyme disease is problematic because early diagnosis is easily missed due to flu-like symptoms that only appear transiently in humans during the early stage of disease. When missed and, therefore left untreated, Lyme disease becomes chronic. Unfortunately, antimicrobial treatment of chronic infection is often unrewarding. Besides skin lesions, arthritis, and carditis, neurological manifestations represent the most frequent clinical involvement for Lyme disease worldwide. In the United States, approximately 15% of patients with untreated Bb infection exhibit Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB). Both central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS) may be affected.  Despite the significance of LNB, many aspects of LNB pathogenesis remain unknown due to the lack of suitable animal model. The long-term goal of this exploratory study is to understand pathogenic mechanisms leading to LNB. Nonhuman primates currently constitute the only available model. However, issues of cost, animal availability, handling complexity, reagents availability, non-reproducible genetic backgrounds, and ethical concerns significantly limit their use. On the other hand, despite an obvious need, more affordable and advantageous mouse models have yet to be developed. Neither meningitis nor encephalitis has been documented in mice. Therefore, the overall objective is to develop a mouse model that will be permissive to Bb entry into the nervous system (NS) and will mimic human LNB.  It is possible that host genetics of mouse strains are responsible for prevention of Bb spirochetes from invading and triggering inflammation in murine NS. Thus, in order to develop the mouse LNB model, we propose to pursue the following specific aim: Determine if genetically diverse recombinant inbred mice will develop LNB upon infection with Bb neurotropic strain. The approach is innovative because it will for the first time involve extensive use of the Collaborative Cross (CC) resource to develop LNB mouse model. CC lines are a genetically diverse panel of recombinant inbred mice that have been obtained through a systemic cross of eight inbred founder mouse strains. The CC lines have been successfully applied to develop first mouse models of Ebola hemorrhagic fever and Aspergillus fumigatus. The experimental design will involve 48 mouse CC lines that wll be infected with neurotropic Bb. Neural tissues will be histologically and molecularly analyzed for the presence of inflammation and Bb spirochetes. The proposed research is significant because the new model will allow the scientific community to significantly advance the field of LNB. Specifically, the LNB model will be the basis for development of new therapeutics and diagnostic tools for LNB patients."
"9542159","ABSTRACT The life span of organisms differs widely among species: C. elegans live 14-25 days, mice for a couple of years, humans into their eighties on average, and organisms such as the giant clam can live upwards of 500 years. There are likely conserved mechanisms that regulate the efficiency of cell function in youth that declines with age, ultimately resulting in systemic and organismal failure and death. In spite of the large number of ideas that have been proposed to account for the loss in efficiency and function as an organism ages, no common integrative theory for aging that is evolutionarily conserved has been advanced and thus, represents a major gap in knowledge. The oxygen paradox highlights the mystery that O2 is so critical a fuel for the metabolic machinery of life, yet so toxic to all forms of life inhabiting this planet. The key to this paradox are the two simple, yet biologically fundamental redox reactions: the first reaction, which is essentially the reverse of photosynthetic water splitting, marks the dawn of eucarya in which mitochondria `respire' oxygen to enzymatically generate proton gradient fueling oxidative phosphorylation and the second reaction where O2 in excess is consumed to generate reactive species that induce damage. To maximize the first reaction and minimize the second, life needed to maintain oxygen levels under tight control. It has been proposed that the evolutionary response to this paradox was to create cholesterol within membranes as a way to ?tame? oxygen and allow for its biologic use as an energy source and as a primary feature that links membranes and metabolism. We hypothesize that caveolin, a scaffolding protein that organizes cholesterol into membrane microdomains, exists as a ?capacitor? to create the efficiency of metabolism in youth through regulation of membrane oxygen and that with aging, caveolin expression is decreased in certain organs, thereby leading to increased oxygen toxicity. We further propose that this toxicity can be limited by re-expression of caveolin in the setting of advanced age. The following specific aims will be studies: Specific Aim 1: Determine what aspects of caveolin serve as membrane oxygen capacitors. Specific Aim 2: Determine the impact of age and caveolin expression on organ oxygen storage capacity and toxicity."
"9528356","ABSTRACT The limited and dwindling effectiveness of current anti-malaria drugs creates an urgent medical need to identify new anti-malarials with novel protein targets. While potentially useful liver- and blood-stage inhibitors of malaria have been identified in phenotypic cell- based screening efforts, a major hurdle in the development of these newly discovered inhibitors is the elucidation of their mode of action. The proposed research involves the use of proteome-wide measurements of protein folding and stability to identify the protein targets of two liver- and blood-stage inhibitors of malaria parasites including clemastine fumarate and concanamycin A. The anti-malarial activities of the two compounds to be investigated here were recently discovered in cell-based screens. While the liver- and blood-stage IC50 values of these compounds have been evaluated in cell-based assays, the protein targets responsible for their anti-malarial activities are not known. Identifying the molecular target(s) of the active compounds discovered through phenotypic screening is an important but challenging task. Proposed here is the use of two different energetic-based methods, the Stability of Proteins from Rates of Oxidation (SPROX) technique and the Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) to identify Plasmodium falciparum protein targets in parasite lysates, both direct and indirect, of clemastine fumarate and concanamycin A. Selected protein hits identified using these energetics-based techniques will be overexpressed in E. Coli and then the proteins in the unpurified E. Coli cell lysates will be re-analyzed by the SPROX and/or CETSA techniques using targeted proteomics methods to differentiate those protein hits that result from direct versus indirect binding interactions with the two anti-malarial agents studied here."
"9536634","Our goal is to examine whether ethnic and racial differences in brain amyloid ? (A?) and tau, the major neuropathology components of Alzheimer?s disease (AD), explain reported ethnic disparities in dementia of the Alzheimer?s type (DAT) in Northern Manhattan We will examine ethnic differences in brain A? and tau, ascertained in-vivo with positron emission tomography (PET), among Hispanics, Non-Hispanic Blacks (Blacks), and Non-Hispanic Whites (Whites) aged 60 to 69 years from Northern Manhattan. We will also explore whether ethnic differences in brain A? and tau explain ethnic differences in memory performance, the earliest clinical marker of AD; whether ethnicity modifies the relation of APOE-?4 and brain A?; whether ethnic disparities in literacy and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) moderate the association of brain A? and tau with memory performance. Lastly, we will explore whether the higher risk of DAT attributable to hyperglycemia (pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes) among Blacks and Hispanics compared with Whites is explained by higher brain A? and tau. The risk of DAT is higher in elderly Blacks and Hispanics in Northern Manhattan compared with Whites. It is unknown whether this disparity is due to differences in AD neuropathology, CVD, CVD risk factors, or social determinants of health (SDOH). There is a paucity of studies of AD biomarkers in Blacks and Hispanics to answer this question, particularly in late middle age. We propose to address these gaps in knowledge taking advantage of an ongoing funded study of A? and tau PET (1R01AG050440, 3R01AG050440-02S1;09/01/15-05/31/20) in 100 Hispanics between 60 and 69 years of age at the time of brain imaging, a critical period for accumulation of AD neuropathology. We propose to extend this funded project to 100 Blacks and Whites aged 60 to 69 years from the same community in order to compare brain A?, tau, CVD, and cognition among Blacks, Hispanics and Whites in this understudied age group. We will ascertain brain A? using 18F-Florbetaben PET, and tau using 18F- THK-5351 PET at 2 time points 24 months apart. We will also conduct brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for co-registration of PET and for ascertainment of CVD (white matter hyperintensities and infarcts). Our primary aim is to examine whether there are ethnic differences in the presence of whole brain fibrillar A?, and tau in medial temporal and inferior temporal cortex, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, among Blacks, Hispanics and Whites aged 60 to 69 years from the community of Northern Manhattan. We will also explore across and within ethnic groups the association of whole brain fibrillar A?, and tau in medial temporal and inferior temporal cortex, with memory performance, and moderation of this association by CVD and literacy. Secondary aim 1 is to compare the association of APOE-?4 with whole brain fibrillar A? and tau across ethnic groups cross sectionally and longitudinally. Secondary aim 2 is to explore if ethnic disparities in hyperglycemia explain ethnic differences in whole brain fibrillar A?, and tau in medial temporal and inferior temporal cortex and memory impairment."
"9538478","PROJECT SUMMARY Gammaherpesviruses establish life-long infection in a majority of humans worldwide and are associated with the development of cancer, including B cell lymphomas. The intimate relationship between gammaherpesviruses and B cell differentiation is directly linked to the lymphomagenic capacity of these viruses. To ensure the establishment of long-term latency in memory B cells, gammaherpesviruses drive a unique polyclonal germinal center reaction during early infection. Germinal center reaction represents a stage of B cell differentiation that is characterized by rapid division of activated B cells along with genetic instability driven by enzymes that either induce DNA breaks or mutagenize DNA. It is not surprising that most Epstein-Barr virus-driven B cell lymphomas originate from germinal center or post germinal center B cells. This robust, gammaherpesvirus-stimulated germinal center reaction is transient and returns to near-baseline levels in long-term infected hosts. Importantly, it is not clear what attenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center reaction. We have identified Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 (IRF-1) as the first host factor that specifically attenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center reaction. Studies proposed here test the hypothesis that IRF-1 is the critical host factor that attenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven expansion and transformation of germinal center B cells throughout life-long infection. The proposed studies will define IRF-1-mediated signaling changes that attenuate gammaherpesvirus-driven expansion of germinal center response and the relative contributions of B- and T cell-intrinsic functions of IRF-1 to this process. Further, proposed studies will develop a novel animal model of gammaherpesvirus lymphomagenesis. Successful completion of the proposed studies will offer insights into the tumor suppressor mechanisms of IRF-1 and generate novel animal models that will be of value to infectious disease, immunology, and cancer fields."
"9468820","Project Summary  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects 2.3 million people globally. MS was traditionally thought to be a T cell mediated disease since autoreactive T cells, a kind of immune cell, against myelin has been found and their role carefully studied in mouse models of MS. However, B cell depleting therapies have had excellent clinical success in treating MS, suggesting a key role for B cells, another kind of immune cell, in MS disease. However, it is unclear how these therapies affect other key immune cells in the blood or in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid that bathes the CNS. Characterization of these changes is crucial to understanding how these therapies work and determining if more targeted approaches can be developed.  Our goal is to characterize the full repertoire of cells in the CSF and blood of MS patients, and determine how these populations are altered longitudinally by treatment with Ocrelizumab. By leveraging a unique therapeutic opportunity, we will identify the spatiotemporal shifts that occur in response to decreased frequencies B cells. To accomplish our goal, we will: 1) Define the composition of CSF as compared to blood from healthy and MS donors, 2) track single cell alterations in blood and CSF of MS patients over the course of Ocrelizumab treatment, and 3) develop and implement unique computational analyses to identify cell states and genes that correlate with disease, treatment, and anatomical compartment. We propose to implement a new method for analyzing single cells, called Seq-Well, which will allow us to transcriptionally profile thousands of single cells in parallel. This method is well suited for profiling rare and low input clinical samples like those from CSF. We hypothesize that alterations in the total pool of B cells will lead to global changes in the immune cell landscape, and specifically, will impact the frequency and transcriptional state of T cells.  This work is fundamental to human health because it will shed light on the mechanism of B cell depleting therapies, should enable the development of immune monitoring strategies, and will refine models of CNS-peripheral cross talk. Specifically, our work will also identify key gene modules underlying clinically relevant axes, potentially suggesting better biomarkers and treatment paradigms while improving our understanding of immune system dysfunction in MS. Finally, the unique data sets and analyses that will be generated as part of this work will contribute broadly to our understanding the CSF and result in new analytical pipelines that integrate various forms of single-cell data."
"9445439","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to improve biomedical engineering education and the ability of biomedical engineers and project teams to translate new ideas into innovative, new medical devices and technologies that better meet healthcare needs in the United States. Biomedical engineers must be able to work on diverse, multidisciplinary project teams, communicate with team members and other personnel, and understand the economic, legal, regulatory, environmental, and social constraints of medical device design. They also must be able to carry out all phases of the design process from needs finding to commercialization of new products.  The goal of the proposed project is to continue to improve the preparation of biomedical engineering graduates to design, develop, and commercialize new medical devices and technologies that will significantly impact public health. This will be accomplished by building upon the successful results of the first four years of the currently funded program (R25 EB013070) and implementing additional enhancements to the undergraduate biomedical engineering design curriculum at Marquette University (MU).  These enhancements will build upon existing collaborations with new and established partners, and result in students' improved understanding of how to translate new devices and technologies from the laboratory to the bedside.  The Specific Aims of the proposed new project include 1) expand students' knowledge of clinical procedures and the clinical environment, and develop their problem identification and needs finding skills, 2) improve the preparation of students to successfully translate and commercialize their design ideas for established or start-up medical device companies by developing their knowledge of current product development practices and design transfer and commercialization activities as part of multidisciplinary project teams, 3) expand students' experience with the entire product development process by adding value proposition creation and lean methods to the currently required design activities, 4) continue to expand students' knowledge of legal and ethical issues by providing them with strategies for dealing with unethical behavior in the work place, and 5) provide students with opportunities to develop design solutions to open- ended problems that can significantly improve health care in underserved populations or help a single client with unmet needs (assistive technology projects) to show students how their work as biomedical engineers can directly improve public health and the lives of others."
"9654114","PROJECT SUMMARY Most mammalian genes have multiple cleavage and polyadenylation (C/P) sites, or pAs, resulting in mRNA isoforms with different coding sequences (CDS) and/or 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs). Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) is rapidly recognized as an important layer of gene regulation, affecting protein diversity and mRNA metabolism. The APA pattern of genes varies across cell/tissue types and is dynamically regulated under different conditions, such as proliferation, differentiation, and in response to extracellular cues. The mechanisms of APA, however, are poorly understood. Our long-term goal is to understand the `regulatory code' of APA in different cells/tissues under physiological and pathological conditions and its biological consequences. In this proposal, we have three specific aims: First, we will examine the role of C/P factors in APA regulation. Second, we will examine how C/P genes are regulated by APA. Third, we will examine the interplay between nuclear export and APA. We expect that the result of this grant will provide systematic views on the mechanisms of APA and shed light on its significance in different cells and tissues, as well as development and differentiation."
"9494158","Project Summary This proposal seeks funding for a Keyence BZ-X710 all-in-one fluorescence microscope, which provides a wide range of wide-field imaging capabilities in concert with incredible ease-of-use. The unique set of microscopy capabilities provided in this microscope permit high throughput, rapid imaging of a vast array of fixed specimens in various preparations, e.g., multi-well microtiter plates, culture dishes, microscope slides, roller tubes, etc. Further, the BZ-X710 incorporates an optional stage-top incubation chamber to enable imaging of live cells and in vitro tissues. Another advantage of the BZ-X710 that has a transformative impact on live cell imaging is the high speed at which large images can be acquired and stitched into a mosaic, with demonstrated repeatability to well below the spatial resolution of the imaging system. Finally, the nature of the illumination system significantly decreases deleterious effects such as photobleaching and photodamage, and thus both living and fixed specimens can be imaged for longer periods of time than with, for example, a confocal microscope. The structured illumination system and deconvolution algorithms allow for rapid imaging of relatively thick tissue slices (up to 500 ?m) at multiple wavelengths. This combination of unique attributes permits the use of BZ-X710 for long-term fluorescent imaging studies of living cells and tissue slices. Observation of living cells with a large number of exposures is paramount for studying long-term behavior of a specimen, and could greatly aid in elucidating the function of biomolecules within the cell. Here we will exploit the power of the BZ-X710 by applying it to many projects of biomedical significance. These projects ask questions whose answers will improve our understanding of basic cell biological phenomena and apply this knowledge to diverse areas of human health, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. The ease-of-use of the Keyence BZ-X710 microscope allows us to incorporate this technology into a microscopy core facility that will enable its use by many research groups, while maintaining access to the major users who have proposed many exciting questions to be addressed here. Incorporation into a Foundational Core and having oversight, training and data acquisition and analysis provided by a university funded facility director with an applied physics PhD and several years of experience in bioscience applications will ensure proper long-term operation."

Together, this team has developed a Discover, Design, Build and Test Framework that will be used in all research projects supported by the UWAC. The Methods Core will support to the R34 projects proposed in this application as well as 8 future R03 level studies. The Methods Core will be led by Drs. Atkins, Hoeft and Munson and will house three incubators: the discovery incubator, which is charged with identifying mutable targets to improve clinician capacity and quality of care, the design/build incubator, which is charged with uncovering quality solutions that clinicians can and will use, and the test incubator, which is charged with conducting qualitative and quantitative analysis of study and center aims. We propose the following aims for our Methods Core: (1) develop a typology of EBPI targets for modification; (2) develop a a matrix of targeted modifications; (3) conduct preliminary analysis to determine if modifications and solutions developed by the DDBT framework indeed improve clinician quality by changing the intended targets. The Methods Core also will provide operational support, disseminate methodological advances and center resources, and evaluate center research productivity and impact. These results will have a significant public health impact that addresses NIMH priorities and IOM recommendations for improving the standards of psychosocial interventions, particularly as it is delivered in low-resourced primary care medicine."
"9452067","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionar data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport systems and constituent proteins.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to expand, update, automate and interlink TCDB. In particular, we will collaborate to integrate and unify the classification systems used by TCDB and Pfam with the formation of a TC ontological system. We will generate new data concerning transport proteins, and expand procedures for making functional predictions. This last effort will derive reliable new biological knowledge from a variety of sources, including phylogeny, motif, domain, operon and regulon analyses. Our Specific Aims are as follows: 1. To compare and evaluate methods of homology establishment, e.g., our and Pfam's statistical approaches, as well as introduce a system of protein repeat unit and domain identification. We will confirm and extend homology results based on structural superimpositions and profile: profile comparisons. We will develop and implement pipelines for the exchange of information between Pfam and TCDB and standardize both classification systems. 2. To incorporate our family descriptions into Wikipedia, to facilitate community annotation and interaction. Thus, we will add to Wikipedia, and integrate with Pfam to create a common platform for community annotation. 3. To create a substrate ontological framework for TCDB, using ChEBI and GO. 4. To use and automate multiple approaches, including phylogeny and synteny, to derive reliable functional predictions and provide guides for other researchers to do the same. 5. To utilize our TCDB advisory board for continued knowledgebase modernization and sustainability."
"9478853","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this well-established training program, which entered its 30th year in May 2013, is to maintain and accelerate long term research progress and innovation in cutaneous biology, skin diseases, and dermatoepidemiology, leading to novel treatments for skin disease and improvements in overall human health. We aim to achieve this by identifying and training the next generation of leaders in this area. Our specific goals are to: (i) expose trainees to the excitement and impact of dermatology research at early stages in their careers; (ii) support the research and training of young scientists with established interests in the skin and its diseases; and (iii) provide cross-disciplinary training in skin biology and diverse fields such as genomics, epidemiology or bioengineering. To these ends we request support for short term (2-3 months) research experiences for 3 medical students; 2 long term (1 year or more) pre-doctoral fellowships to support the thesis research of MD PhD students, PhD students engaging in innovative, interdisciplinary work relevant to cutaneous biology and skin disease, or students pursuing dual MD and Masters in Clinical Epidemiology (MSCE) degrees; and 4 post-doctoral fellowships for MD, PhD and MD PhD scientists committed to careers in cutaneous biology and skin disease. To promote interdisciplinary research, our program involves trainers from the Penn Engineering School, the School of Veterinary Medicine, and the Wistar Institute as well as from Dermatology and multiple other departments across the Penn School of Medicine, and includes experts in clinical studies, bioengineering, proteomics and genomics research. A particular emphasis of our training program is to encourage and train physician scientists in Dermatology. In addition to training MD and MD PhD students in skin-related research, we established a four-year clinical/research dermatology residency program in which trainees pursue T32-supported postdoctoral research fellowships that provide a basis for obtaining independent funding. This program has already been extremely successful, attracting exceptionally qualified, enthusiastic trainees, several of whom are now established as NIH-funded independent physician-scientists.  Our training program includes opportunities for lab-based research, translational research, clinical trials, and epidemiology. In parallel with hands on research training, our trainees atted seminars, journal clubs and technical and skills workshops both within and outside Dermatology. We provide networking lunches and research retreats for trainees, and trainees invite two seminar speakers per year to present their research in the Dermatology Seminar Series, followed by lunch with the speaker. Trainees receive formal instruction in the Responsible Conduct of Research, and extensive mentoring, career counseling, and help in identifying suitable positions in academics, industry, or for further training in clinical or reseach areas from the Director and co- Director of the training program as well as from their mentors and, in the case of MD PhD and PhD thesis students, their home Graduate Programs."
"9477063","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed surgery training plan is an integrated critical care doctoral dissertation research project, supervised by Dr. Lyle Moldawer within the Sepsis and Critical Illness Research Center (SCIRC) at the University of Florida, College of Medicine. The program is ideally designed to equip the candidate to attain his career goals of becoming a physician-scientist. Traumatic injuries are presently the leading cause of death for persons less than 45 years of age. Severe sepsis has more than doubled since 2000, and sepsis currently represents the 11th leading cause of death, and the leading diagnosed hospitalization expense. Although trauma and sepsis patients are now increasingly surviving their initial and early insults due to improved acute medical care, unfortunately two year survivability for these patients has remained unchanged. For trauma and sepsis patients, the greatest obstacle to convalescence is now a chronic immunological disequilibrium that we have termed persistent inflammation, immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS), and the declining clinical course is characterized by a persistent acute-phase response with systemic inflammation, continuous protein catabolism (despite optimal nutrition), poor wound healing, immunosuppression, and recurrent infections. The agents activating and perpetuating PICS are unresolved, and currently there is no established paradigm to discriminate between those patients who will improve clinically within 14 days from those who will progress to PICS. Early, if not immediately after trauma and sepsis onset, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that control inflammatory pathways in the innate and adaptive immune system are likely activated by either damage associated molecular patterns [DAMPs: including endogenous mitochondrial DNA and HMGB1] and/or pathogen associated molecular patterns [PAMPs: including bacterial DNA and bacterial lipopolysaccharide] that are released into the circulation during tissue damage and bacterial infection. The objective of this proposal is to develop an early prognostic of trauma and sepsis clinical trajectory, and to gain insight into the agents activating and perpetuating PICS. The overarching hypothesis is that a time-dependent circulatory load of PAMPs and DAMPs dictates whether trauma and sepsis patients recover or enter PICS. Immediately following trauma and sepsis insult, a small amount of blood (less than 10ml) will be drawn from patients in the intensive care unit. Thereafter, for the duration of ICU stay, blood will be periodically drawn to determine the interactions between the immune system and the levels of DAMPs and PAMPs. Leukocyte genomic expression and PAMP levels will be measured with NanoString. DAMP levels will be measured by a combination of qPCR, ELISA, and NanoString. As DAMPs and PAMPs are thought to be associated with an increasing number of diseases, the successful completion of these studies may ultimately contribute to a better understanding of many or most human diseases."
"9512636","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Role of glial circadian clock dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer?s Disease Chronic disruptions of the circadian system, manifesting as sleep disturbances, day-night confusion, and ?sundowning?, are well-described and debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer?s Disease. While circadian disruption has long been considered a consequence of the degenerative process in AD, accumulating human and mouse data suggest that circadian rhythm abnormalities may begin before overt cognitive symptoms, and could play an important contributory role in AD pathogenesis. Circadian rhythms are generated in cells by specific clock genes, which are expressed in neurons and glia throughout the brain and control 24-hour oscillations in transcription. We have discovered that abrogating the function of the circadian clock via deletion of the master clock gene Bmal1 in the brain causes severe gliosis, synaptic loss, neuroinflammation, and age- related neurodegeneration. The circadian clock is particularly robust in glial cells, regulating cellular activation and inflammatory responses in both astrocytes and microglia. Thus, we will address the bidirectional relationship between circadian clock disruption and amyloid-beta (A?)-related pathology in cellular and mouse models of AD, focusing on the function of clock genes in astrocytes and microglia. Using novel methods to interrogate cell type-specific transcription in vivo and in vitro, we will test the hypothesis that A? directly impairs the cellular circadian clocks of astrocytes and microglia in mouse AD models via an oxidative stress-dependent mechanism. We will then determine if cell type-specific Bmal1 deletion in astrocytes and microglia, respectively, will exacerbate neuroinflammation and synapse loss in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. We have identified specific circadian-controlled pathways in astrocytes and microglia that may mediate these effects, and will attempt to target these pathways therapeutically to mitigate neuroinflammation and synaptic degeneration in aged APP/PS1 mice."
"9509152","Hundreds of millions of people are infected with Dengue and Zika viruses (DENV and ZIKV), flaviviruses that can lead to life-threatening diseases (DENV) or devastating congenital abnormalities such as microcephaly (ZIKV). Unfortunately, no antiviral treatments are available to combat either virus, and efforts in developing antiviral therapeutics have been hampered by a paucity of information on critical virus-host interactions that regulate replication and fitness of these viruses. Mammalian cells are equipped with elaborate, intrinsic mechanisms to fend off invading viruses, but little is known about host factors that restrict DENV or ZIKV. Our recent in vitro studies have shown that TRIM56, a tripartite-motif protein, is a novel antiviral host factor that possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity to restrict DENV, ZIKV, and two closely related viruses, yellow fever virus and bovine viral diarrhea virus. Yet, the underlying mechanism remains elusive, as does the physiologic role of TRIM56 in flavivirus infection in vivo. In consideration of the broad antiviral activity of TRIM56 against four different flaviviruses (BVDV, YFV, DENV and ZIKV) that have limited homology in viral proteins, we hypothesize that the TRIM56 E3 ligase targets a (subset of) host factor(s) that has common, regulatory role(s) in replication and/or fitness of different flaviviruses, a better understanding of which may inform antiviral strategies that have broad activity against medically important flaviviruses including DENV and ZIKV. Two independent specific aims are proposed in this application: In Aim 1, we will determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-flavivirus action of TRIM56. Specifically, we will address the roles of several host-encoded RNA-binding proteins, which we found TRIM56 forms a complex with, in DENV and ZIKV RNA replication and determine their regulation by TRIM56. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of TRIM56 in host antiviral defense against ZIKV infection in vivo, using a TRIM56 knockout mouse model we recently developed. Results from the proposed studies will yield novel insights into host factors that regulate DENV and ZIKV replication and fill key knowledge gaps concerning the antiviral mechanism and precise role of TRIM56 in flavivirus restriction. The gained new knowledge may inform the development of antiviral therapeutics against Dengue, Zika and possibly other flavivirus infections."
"9467974","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Autoimmunity in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is believed to be the result of a complex interplay between varying degrees of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, which include pathogens and commensal gut microbes, dietary components and toxic substances. While recent studies, including ours, have shown much interest in understanding the role of interaction between environmental factors including gut microbes on autoimmunity, the potential contribution of inflammation initiated in the gut mucosa to systemic autoimmunity in lupus and the root cause of gut inflammation in lupus-susceptible background have not been investigated. This warrants studies to better understand the environmental and genetic factor interactions that trigger/perpetuate the early events of disease processes in at-risk subjects. Identification of early predictors of autoimmune processes will help develop novel, safe and effective strategies that can prevent systemic autoimmunity in lupus. Recently, using a spontaneous pre-clinical model of SLE which presents slow progressing disease and strong gender bias as seen in humans, we found that pro-inflammatory events are initiated in the gut mucosa at juvenile age (sex hormone independently), long before the onset of systemic autoimmunity and clinical disease, suggesting a role for these events in the systemic autoimmune process that occurs eventually. Our preliminary studies also identified previously unknown molecular events that cause gut inflammation and contribute to systemic autoimmunity. These studies show that 1) higher expression of X-linked TLR genes in intestinal epithelial and immune cells of lupus-prone females as early as juvenile age compared to lupus-resistant strain; 2) higher X- linked TLR expression and inflamed phenotype of gut mucosa at juvenile age positively correlates with the rate of autoimmune progression and disease incidence at late adult ages, 3) engagement of TLR7 and TLR8 induces profoundly high expression of inflammatory factors in IECs and immune cells from lupus-prone mice, and 4) depletion of gut microbiota suppresses gut inflammation and autoimmunity in them. These observations prompt us to hypothesize ?the systemic autoimmune process in lupus susceptible subjects is initiated and perpetuated, as gut inflammation at juvenile ages, by high-dose TLR7/8 - microbiota interaction?. Therefore, we propose studies: 1) to define the requirement of X-linked TLRs in gut inflammation and lupus autoimmunity; and 2) to determine the requirement of interaction with microbiota for, and the role of X-linked TLR activation in, juvenile onset of gut inflammation and lupus autoimmunity. Our proposed study is expected to identify early pro- inflammatory events that eventually lead to systemic autoimmunity in lupus, but also introduce a novel and rational therapeutic target for preventing lupus autoimmunity."
"9461456","Project Summary Werner Syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by premature development of aging features. In addition, WS individuals have an increased predisposition to cancers that are mesenchymal in origin. Primary cells derived from WS patients exhibit elevated levels of chromosomal translocations, inversions, and deletions of large segments of DNA and have a high spontaneous mutation rate. The Werner syndrome protein (WRN), mutated in WS, is unique among the RecQ family proteins as it possesses exonuclease and 3? to 5? helicase activities. Thesetwo enzymatic activities have coordinated functions on a variety of structured DNA substrates. Additionally, WRN also has nuclease-independent functions during DNA replication and repair, although these non-enzymatic activities are not well understood. WRN forms dynamic sub-complexes with different factors involved in multiple biological processes.Though accumulating evidence suggests that WRN plays a crucial role in genome stability maintenance pathways, the exact contribution of WRN in preventing genome instability is unclear. Our hypothesis is that WRN suppresses genomic instability by facilitating faithful repair of collapsed replication forks upon replication stress. To accomplish our goals, three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1. Verify that a single phosphorylation site dictates other post- translational modifications in WRN and its function in genome stability maintenance upon replication stress; Aim 2. Determine the mechanism used by WRN to stabilize Rad51 at collapsed replication forks; and Aim 3. Verify that WRN interacts with specific-genomic loci and suppresses mis-joining of collapsed replication forks. Innovative aspects of this proposal include: a. Development of a novel system to identify cell cycle-specific biological functions of WRN. In this system, expression of WRN can be regulated in a cell cycle-specific manner. b. Establishment of a new tool to map genome interaction domains of WRN and precisely identify fidelity of replication-associated DNA double-strand breaks at a single nucleotide level. Results from this genomic sequencing study will provide information on molecular biomarker(s) contributing to the initiation of carcinogenic events in WS. Significantly, deciphering the molecular choreography of WRN, its biochemical activities, post-translational modifications and interaction partners in the fidelity of replication fork processing will provide new insight into the molecular origin of cancer in WS individuals. Our results will ultimately advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of WS."
"9497240","Project Abstract  Emergency medicine developed as a specialty to treat the acutely ill and injured, but increasingly cares for older adults with multiple comorbid conditions. An Emergency Department (ED) visit is a sentinel event for older adults, often signifying a breakdown in care coordination and worsening clinical and functional status. Half of Americans 65 years and older are seen in the ED in the last month of life, and three-quarters visit the ED in the 6 months before death. Meanwhile, the number and rate of admissions to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) by emergency providers have been increasing, especially among older adults. Three-quarters of older adults with serious illness have thought about end-of-life care, and only 12% want life-prolonging care. Emergency providers impact a patient's clinical trajectory by balancing the potential harms and benefits of hospitalization and connecting seriously ill, older adults with outpatient services. Until recently, little attention has been paid to aligning care plans with patient goals for older adults in the ED. To address this gap in the delivery of goal-directed emergency care of seriously ill, older adults, our team conducted a randomized controlled trial of ED-initiated palliative care consultation in advanced cancer that showed improvement in quality of life at 12 weeks. We also showed in a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation project that ED- based primary palliative care innovations reduced the percentage of geriatric ED admissions to the ICU from 2.3% to 0.9% through screening for high-risk older adults, early referral to palliative care and hospice, and emergency provider training and education in palliative care principles. Whether this approach will be feasible and effective in EDs with great heterogeneity in resources is unknown. We will tailor `primary palliative care for emergency medicine' (PRIM-ER) for implementation in a diverse group of 35 EDs that vary in specialty geriatric and palliative care capacity, geographic region, payer mix, and demographics. This proposal builds upon existing research partnerships to implement and evaluate PRIM-ER on ED disposition, healthcare utilization, and survival in older adults with serious, life-limiting illness. Our hypothesis is that older adult visitors with serious, life-limiting illness cared for by providers with primary palliative care skills will be less likely to be admitted to an inpatient setting, more likely to be discharged home or to a palliative care service, and will have higher home health and hospice use, fewer inpatient days and ICU admissions at 6 months, and longer survival than those seen prior to implementation. We propose a pragmatic, cluster-randomized stepped wedge design to test the effectiveness of PRIM-ER in 35 EDs. PRIM-ER includes: 1) evidence-based, multidisciplinary primary palliative care education, 2) simulation-based workshops on communication in serious illness, 3) clinical decision support, and 4) provider audit and feedback. The specific aims are divided into a: 1) UG3 Phase, in which we will tailor the protocols to a diverse ED context and pilot test the intervention at two sites; and a 2) UH3 Phase in which we will test the intervention in a stepped wedge design in 33 EDs."
"9529868","Abstract The effort of much research has concentrated on the identification of autoantigens in type 1 diabetes (T1D) as targets for therapeutic interventions and as predictive biomarkers for disease risk. Our lab has recently discovered a unique class of post- translationally modified antigens that are the ligands for pathogenic CD4 T cell clones isolated from the NOD mouse, the predominant model for T1D. The antigens are comprised of fragments of proinsulin (C-peptide) covalently linked to other natural cleavage products of ?-cell secretory granule proteins to form ?hybrid insulin peptides? (HIPs). The identification of HIP-specific CD4 T cells cultured from the infiltrated pancreatic islets of T1D individuals implies that HIPs may also serve as putative epitopes for autoantibodies. The primary goal of this proposal is to identify a novel panel of autoantibody biomarkers reactive to HIP antigens among T1D individuals. Autoantibodies to HIPs could serve as early indicators of active ?-cell destruction and as parameters for stratification of candidates that would most benefit from immunotherapy. We hypothesize that HIPs and autoantibodies targeting human HIP epitopes can be detected in the bloodstream of newly diagnosed T1D and individuals at high risk for disease. We propose to develop sensitive and specific bioassays focusing on these new HIP antigens as targets. First, we will design radioimmunoprecipitation assays to detect autoantibodies in the sera of T1D patients targeting the known human HIPs. The assay conditions will be optimized and specificity demonstrated with competitive ligands. Concurrently we will explore the possibility that HIPs are directly detectable in the circulation as they may be co-secreted with insulin or be a casualty of ?-cell stress. Anti- HIP monoclonal antibodies will be used to capture HIPs from sera in a modified ELISA format. Finally, if our hypothesis that formation of HIPs plays a key role in the pathogenesis of T1D is valid, then a broader collection of HIPs has yet to be identified. We will screen human HIP libraries with T1D sera to identify humoral immunoreactivity to additional HIP sequences. HIPs or autoantibodies targeting HIPS would introduce a new generation of biomarkers in T1D translational research. They could provide metrics for disease risk, staging of ?-cell destruction and the foundation for HIP epitope targets for innovative drug development."
"9530249","PROJECT SUMMARY GPR55 is an atypical cannabinoid receptor whose endogenous agonist is L-?-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). Emerging evidence indicate new roles for GPR55, including modulation of the function of endothelial cells. This project will investigate the role of GPR55 in the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). BBB has a critical role in neuroprotection by permitting the transport of nutrients to the brain and removal of metabolites, while protecting the brain from potentially toxic or harmful substances. BBB dysfunction occurs in several neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. A better understanding of the factors that modulate BBB permeability is critical for designing effective therapies for neuroprotection. Our central hypothesis is that LPI activation of GPR55 produces a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+, mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), increasing the BBB permeability. We will use a multidisciplinary approach including measurement of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+, cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS levels, and assessment of endothelial BBB permeability in vitro and in vivo. We will interface pharmacological modulation using specific GPR55 ligands with molecular knockdown approaches. The in vitro experiments will be carried out in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBMVEC). The project has two specific aims: Aim 1: To investigate the role of GPR55 in modulation of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ in brain microvascular endothelial cells. Ca2+ is a second messenger critical for cellular functions; however, a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration produces mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and initiates oxidative stress. We will use imaging techniques to monitor the changes in cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+, cytosolic ROS and mitochondrial ROS in response to GPR55 activation in RBMVEC. Aim 2: To investigate the impact of GPR55?s modulation of endothelial cells Ca2+ upon BBB permeability. Endothelial cells of the BBB form a monolayer with low paracellular permeability and high electrical resistance. We will assess the changes in endothelial permeability produced by GPR55 activation in vitro and in vivo. The results of this project will provide essential information of BBB regulation by cannabinoid receptors, while identifying a new potential therapeutic target for neuroprotection."

"9476367","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the 3rd leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US with increasing prevalence in older adults. The impact of COPD on the brain is an area of expanding research interest. A staggering 40-60% of patients with COPD have cognitive impairments including deficits in executive functioning (e.g., decision making), processing speed, and memory. Intact cognition is critical for independently managing daily tasks (e.g., medication and money management). Since there are currently no treatments to fully reverse cognitive impairment once it is present, preventing and delaying onset is essential. Given the high prevalence of COPD, understanding how COPD confers an increased risk for cognitive impairment should be a top public health priority. There is an urgent need to identify potentially modifiable physiological characteristics of individuals with early COPD-related pathophysiology who are at risk of developing brain abnormalities. The earliest changes that occur in COPD are driven by an enhanced chronic inflammatory response that includes small airway disease in the lung and vascular abnormalities. COPD-related lung pathophysiology can be measured continuously and is separable from amount of smoking. These physiological changes are often present in individuals who do not meet traditional criteria for COPD diagnosis and have not yet manifested significant clinical symptoms. We propose that chronic smokers who are susceptible to COPD and show evidence of COPD-related lung pathophysiology on lung CT also experience vascular dysfunction (particularly central artery stiffness) that contributes to structural brain abnormalities and cognitive impairment. The proposed project will: 1) model the effects of novel physiological mechanisms on the brain in COPD, 2) focus on changes in brain structure and function early in the development of COPD by including smokers who have evidence of early COPD-related lung pathophysiology but do not meet traditional criteria for COPD, and 3) utilize advanced technology to assess the lung (lung CT) and brain (MRI). We will recruit participants with existing lung CT from ongoing NIH projects to complete pulmonary and vascular measures, cognitive assessment, and brain MRI. The project is highly multidisciplinary and leverages unique resources at the University of Iowa including the CTSA supported Institute for Clinical and Translational Science, the Translational Human Vascular Physiology Lab, the Iowa Neuroimaging Consortium, and the Iowa Comprehensive Lung Imaging Center."

We will build on the  history of constructive engagement with this community that has led to a choice of research projects for the  Penn-SRP which reflects community priorities. In our activities we will work in partnership with identified  stakeholder groups for the Ambler and Bo-Rit superfund sites and surrounding communities. We will identify  information needs for each stakeholder group, including the economically disadvantaged and environmental  justice (EJ) communities in close proximity to the site. We will provide information on the needs and  perspectives of different groups to facilitate constructive understanding of differing points of view. To reduce  confusion, blame, anxiety and mistrust we will facilitate engagement and information exchange among the  diverse and relevant constituencies in the Ambler area by creating opportunities for constituent groups,  including government agencies, to learn from each other. A Stakeholder Advisory Board with strong  community participation will help guide our activities. Tools for maintaining communication with the  community will include a website, quarterly newsletter, a yearly report, presentations at community events  and community fora. We will identify and respond to changing research priorities as the superfund and  remediation processes unfold. . Community fora will be used to help generate research priorities and to  transmit scientific findings. We will develop information and messages and use communication channels  appropriate for each constituent group within the community, reflecting the economic, racial and ethnic  diversity. The CEC will work closely with each of the 6 research projects, ensuring bidirectional information  flow. We will work closely with the Research Translation Core to maximize mutual understanding by  Government agencies and of community constituents of implications of research findings and of each other's  perspectives. We will help provide access to the site and to community constituents for trainees in the  Interdisciplinary Training Core to help develop understanding of the diversity of constituent interests and to  improve their understanding of the priorities and needs of each group. We will maintain a database of current  and former Ambler residents who would like to volunteer to help in CEC activities or participate in Penn-SRP  research. The reach, penetration and actions that result from CEC activities will be formally evaluated."
"9480061","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this proposal is the prevention of autoimmune mediated Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). T1DM is a serious life limiting disease that strikes predominantly in children and adolescents. The TrialNet clinical research network, the focus of the proposal, designs and conducts studies aimed at preventing or delaying the onset or progression of type 1 diabetes, both highly relevant public health goals. Many promising interventions must be tested in a safe and efficient manner in order to achieve this goal. A well-organized cooperative network of capable institutes, the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet group, has greatly facilitated the prompt completion of many clinical trials needed to test these potential interventions. The application responds to the RFA to select the clinical centers that will form TrialNet for the next 5 years.  The goal of this proposal is to both continu and improve the infrastructure essential to completing the current TrialNet studies seeking to prevent T1DM in subjects at risk for T1DM, and to preserve endogenous insulin secretion in subjects with new onset T1DM. This application reviews Stanford's five-year experience as a successful and productive TrialNet national center in California and highlights Stanford's plans for extending and improving recruitment and retention activities for the next 5 years. These plans include both completing the current TrialNet studies and implementing the expected upcoming trials.  The Stanford University TrialNet Center aggressively recruits relatives into the Pathway to Prevention study both at Stanford University and across our affiliate network in California, Nevada, and Arizona. This study is the path to all of TrialNet's T1DM prevention trials. Our center has been very successful at transitioning eligible subjects into TrialNet's randomized prevention trials. Long-term retention of Stanford's subjects in all studies continues to be outstanding. The Stanford University TrialNet Center has enrolled subjects in four Mechanistic trials, six trials designed to preserve endogenous insulin product at the onset of T1DM, and five T1DM prevention trials. Stanford is particularly proud of its role in conceiving and leading the Effects of Metabolic at Onset of Diabetes on Progression of T1DM to its successful conclusion. The Stanford University TrialNet Center is well positioned to continue to support TrialNet's ultimate raison d'?tre, the prevention of T1DM."
"9510428","SUMMARY Hookworm infection remains one of the most important public health threats worldwide, with an estimated 800 million people infected. Heavy hookworm infection is the leading cause of anemia in the tropics, resulting in debilitating and sometimes fatal iron-deficiency anemia caused by blood loss to feeding adult worms in the intestine. Children, pregnant women, and the elderly are particularly susceptible to morbidity from hookworm infection. Control strategies are restricted to periodic de-worming of infected individuals with benzimidazole (BZ) anthelmintics. There is considerable concern that resistance to BZ drugs will develop with increased use in mass drug administration (MDA) programs to control hookworms. Resistance is also a major concern for other drugs such as ivermectin (IVM) and pyrantel (PYR) which are commonly used to treat lymphatic filariasis and soil transmitted nematodes. Molecular tests to monitor the emergence of resistance are necessary, but the genetic mutations that confer resistance to BZ, PYR and IVM are unknown in hookworm. Molecular tests can help tailor drug treatments during MDA to be more effective, but first we need to identify mutations that can emerge in the wild and lead to resistance. We have identified a strain of hookworm Ancylostoma caninum that exhibits resistance to BZ, PYR, and IVM. This is the first known strain of hookworm that is resistant to three drugs, as well as the first resistant strain resistant to both TBZ and IVM. This strain was not developed in a laboratory and so represents a unique opportunity to understand the genetics of naturally emerging resistance. We propose to use this strain to identify the underlying mechanisms of resistance, and to determine if resistance to one drug selects for resistance to the others. In Aim 1, we propose to conduct massively parallel sequencing of resistant recombinants from a cross between our resistant strain (termed KGR) and the wildtype (susceptible) strain (termed WMD). We will search for areas of high SNP density from the resistance parental strain within the F2 recombinant strain, so as to identify the causative genetic lesions. In Aim 2, we will use Caenorhabditis elegans as a surrogate to test the sufficiency of identified mutations from Aim 1 in conferring resistance. This proposed research plan would represent the first ever example of recombinant SNP mapping in hookworm, and will reveal novel, naturally emerging markers of AR. These markers will permit the development of molecular based tools to monitor the frequency of resistance alleles in populations undergoing treatment in a timeframe that permits the implementation of steps to prevent widespread resistance from developing in treated hookworm populations."
"9482690","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals 70 and older are the fastest growing group of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Research shows that decision-making regarding initiation of dialysis is impaired by poor communication and lack of understanding about the options for management of ESRD. Some small studies suggest that, among older adults, dialysis may be associated with longer life expectancy but possibly worse quality of life, compared to conservative management without dialysis. Yet little is known about what older adults can expect after initiating dialysis in terms of patient-centered outcomes such as functional status and cognitive function. Furthermore, even though the choice regarding dialysis initiation involves a series of difficult trade-offs between potential longevity gains with dialysi and potentially better quality of life with conservative management, there has been little research into patient, family, and clinician perspectives on this decision-making process, and very few resources exist to promote decision-making that reflects patients' values and informed treatment preferences. This proposal has the following three interrelated and complementary aims that address these challenges related to dialysis decision-making: 1) Define the trajectories of functional status and cognitive function for adults 70 and older with ESRD before and after initiation of dialysis, compared to the trajectories of adults not on dialysis. 2) Explor perspectives about the decision to initiate dialysis (versus maximum conservative management) among adults 70 and older, their families, and clinicians. 3) Develop and pilot test a decision aid for decisionally-capable older patients with impending ESRD and their families, designed to improve knowledge about dialysis and conservative management options and to improve clarity about one's values and treatment preferences.  The first project is a quantitative analysis using nationally-representative longitudinal survey data from the Health and Retirement Study, linked with Medicare claims. The second project features qualitative semistructured interviews with patients, family members, and clinicians who are at different points in the decisionmaking process (before and after deciding about dialysis). The third project will use the knowledge gained from Aims 1 and 2 to inform the design of a decision aid specifically for decisionally-capable adults 70 and older who are expected to need dialysis within 12 months, which will be pilot-tested with patients. The results from Aim 3 will contribute preliminary data to an R01 proposal of a randomized-controlled trial of the decision aid.         The overall objective of this K23 Career Development Award is to support the early career of Dr. Melissa Wachterman, a palliative care physician and health services researcher at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wachterman is a promising junior investigator specializing in research related to geriatric palliative care. Her career goal is to become an independently-funded clinician-investigator conducting research that improves quality of care and patient-centered treatment decision-making for seriously-ill older adults and their families. This proposal builds o Dr. Wachterman's prior research on end-of-life care for older adults with chronic diseases such as dementia and her more recent work exploring older patients' perspectives on dialysis and communication barriers between nephrologists and patients when discussing prognosis.         This K23 award will help Dr. Wachterman accomplish the following goals: 1) to obtain advanced training in biostatistics and epidemiology, including analytic skills using both longitudinal nationallyrepresentative survey data and administrative data; 2) to acquire advanced training in qualitative research methods; 3) to acquire an understanding of theoretical frameworks of shared decision-making and develop skills in decision aid development and evaluation; 4) to develop as an investigator to ensure a successful transition from this career development award to independent R01-level funding.         To achieve these goals, Dr. Wachterman has chosen a mentoring team committed to her success as a clinician investigator that capitalizes on her joint appointments at three leading academic medical centers affiliated with Harvard Medical School: Brigham and Women's Hospital, VA Boston Healthcare System, and Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Her primary mentor is Dr. Nancy Keating, Associate Professor of Medicine and Health Policy at Harvard Medical School and an internationally-recognized health services researcher with expertise in palliative care. Her co-mentor is Dr. Edward Marcantonio, a geriatrician and internationallyrenowned clinical investigator in aging research. To complement the extensive expertise of Drs. Keating and Marcantonio, Dr. Wachterman has worked closely with them to carefully select a group of talented local advisors to provide additional knowledge and experience in qualitative research, decision science, nephrology, and biostatistics. She has also enlisted the support of a Steering Committee of nationally-known leaders with expertise relevant to her proposal. Overall, Dr. Wachterman will benefit greatly from working in Harvard's vibrant research community, which will provide her with skilled mentorship and support as she prepares to embark on her career as an independent investigator."
"9485193","PROJECT SUMMARY One of the best characterized pathways implicated in metabolic dysfunction is the activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, which guides cellular processes pertaining to adipogenesis and nutrient utilization. Developmental exposures to PPAR-activating toxicants have been widely associated with low birth weight, and yet, these individuals have increased risk for obesity and diabetes later in life. Pharmacological activation of PPAR signaling is the mode of action for some of the most effective drugs for Type II Diabetes. However, chronic exposures to environmental PPAR activators are associated with increased risk for metabolic syndrome in adulthood. The spatiotemporal mechanisms guiding this shift in metabolic efficiency require extensive characterization. Preliminary data demonstrates that embryonic exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), a PPAR? activator, alters pancreas morphology and embryonic expression of hormones and digestive enzymes crucial for metabolism. The goal of this study is to identify the mechanisms by which toxicant-induced PPAR activation perturbs embryonic nutrition, yet increases susceptibility to metabolic syndrome later in life. The first aim of this study will determine the mechanisms by which PFOS-induced PPAR signaling perturbs embryonic nutrient uptake, distribution and metabolism in the zebrafish embryo?a homologous model for human embryonic nutrition. The second aim of this study will discover windows of susceptibility during which chronic exogenous PPAR activation can influence pancreatic ?-cell resilience and function, and can increase risk for obesity and diabetes. Overall, this project serves to elucidate a relationship between exogenous PPAR activation, embryonic nutrition, and metabolic syndrome later in life. This project directly addresses the goals of NIEHS to: 1) provide a mechanism by which developmental exposures to PPAR- activating compounds directly affects embryonic uptake, distribution, and metabolism, and 2) identify the longitudinal pathologic and biochemical consequences of these same exposures to identify key windows of susceptibility to metabolic dysfunction throughout the lifecourse."

"9615601","PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma results from a complex interplay between genetic background and environmental triggers. The majority of asthma flares are triggered by respiratory viral infections, in particular with human rhinovirus (RV). Asthma is genetically strongly linked to ORMDL3, a protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum with various cellular functions. It is overall incompletely understood how ORMDL3 is functionally related to asthma. One of the functions ORMDL3 has is a key regulatory role in cellular sphingolipid metabolism. ORMDL3 regulates de novo sphingolipid synthesis that is mostly controlled by serine-palmitoyl CoA transferase (SPT). Decreased SPT activity results in airway hyperreactivity, the key feature of asthma, suggesting that this specific metabolic pathway is critically involved in asthma pathogenesis. The genetic ORMDL3 variants that are associated with asthma also increase the association of early respiratory infections with childhood asthma, and have specifically been linked to RV-associated asthma. This proposal will address if responses to RV infections are dependent on cellular sphingolipid composition and if RV infection itself affects cellular sphingolipid homeostasis. Supported by preliminary data that demonstrate enhanced airway reactivity in the context of decreased sphingolipid synthesis following infection with RV and an effect of RV, but not respiratory syncytial virus, on sphingolipid synthesis in airway epithelial cells, two specific aims are proposed to assess the central hypothesis that RV-triggered asthma critically depends on and effects sphingolipid homeostasis: Aim 1 will evaluate the response and interaction of human airway epithelial cells with and without impaired sphingolipid synthesis with RV. Aim 2 will assess the effect of RV in the context of decreased sphingolipid synthesis on airway reactivity and lung immune cells. Overall, these studies will provide the basis for a better understanding of the mechanisms for virally-triggered asthma and may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets."
"9472224","PROJECT SUMMARY The Hawaii Statewide Research and Education Partnership (HiSREP) comprises a network of nearly all of the institutions of higher learning in the state of Hawaii, specifically 4 primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), 1 University of Hawaii (UH) college and 4 UH community colleges under the management of the lead R1 institution, the University of Hawaii at Manoa. In the previous grant cycle, INBRE III focused on strengthening the research community and infrastructure at the partner institutions outside of the lead institution. This was accomplished through a tightly coordinated leadership team overseeing an integrated program of support for new laboratory construction under Alterations & Renovation funding, acquisition of new instrumentation, funding for junior investigator research and undergraduate student research experiences paired with outreach and multi-level mentoring. This resulted in substantial expansion of the research base, stronger student engagement leading to a near doubling in student participants, and new initiatives in career advancement. In INBRE IV, HiSREP will continue the development of emerging investigators, but will widen the reach of the network to all levels of biomedical research scientists through a new array of competitive granting mechanisms including teaching-postdoctoral fellowships, pilot projects, new initiatives and team-based collaborative grants through a Developmental Research Project Program (DRPP). Research under HiSREP will be guided by two key themes, Natural Products and Molecular Medicine, which emphasize notable strengths in the biomedical research community in Hawaii. In addition, HiSREP will support a reorganized Bioinformatics Core as a centralized resource across the state to provide education on bioinformatics, aid with research design, technical expertise including development of new informatics tools, data management and analysis. The Bioinformatics Core will promote community synergy for researchers and students through one-on-one, group, workshop, course and online interactions, the latter through a real-time research community portal. The student research program under the PATHway to Biomedical Careers will look to embrace a wider range of undergraduates by emphasizing collaborative group projects through volunteer, intern, scholar and returning researcher opportunities, including partnerships with complementary undergraduate research programs, while maintaining focus on individual career development through skill training, practical mentoring sessions, extended resources and workforce development. In addition, PATHway will develop proactive advanced training for laboratory supervisors to increase research sophistication as well as opportunity statewide, leading to increased capacity. It will also ultimately enhance undergraduate education through incorporation of research activity into the basic science curriculum.

Strikingly, older adults, and especially those at risk for chronic medical disorders, account for approximately 90% of these deaths. Studies comparing influenza vaccine responses of older adults with those of young adults show that immune responses are significantly decreased in older adults. It is estimated that influenza vaccine efficacy is approximately 30-50% in older adults, compared to 70-90% in young-middle aged adults. Compounding this age-related decline in response to vaccination are findings that depression and chronic stress further impair older adults' immune responses to influenza vaccination. Caregiving for a family member with dementia is a robust stressor, and is associated with poor responses to influenza vaccination in older adults, as well as increased levels of proinflammatory biomarkers, which mediate many of the chronic diseases of aging. In this proposal, we consider the immunological consequences of the significant psychological distress experienced by older adult caregivers of family members with dementia. A wide variety of psychosocial interventions can lessen the psychological burden of family or spousal dementia caregiving; Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in particular has psychological benefit for caregivers, yet its biological effects for these burdened caregivers remain unknown. Here we propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of MBSR for older adult caregivers of family dementia patients. Notably, no RCT to-date has done all of what we propose to do: focus on older adult family dementia caregivers who experience significant psychological distress; have as the primary outcome measure adaptive humoral and cellular immune response to influenza vaccine; include surveillance for influenza-like disease during flu season; include evaluation of proinflammatory biomarkers associated with morbidity and mortality in older adults; consider changes in mindfulness and stress as mediators of MBSR's effects on immune function; and include a long-term follow-up of MBSR practice activities. Our aims are to: Aim 1. Identify the effects of MBSR training and practice on adaptive immune responses to influenza vaccination as well as outcomes following influenza infection in stressed older adult family dementia caregivers. Aim 2. Identify the effects of MBSR training and practice on circulating levels of the proinflammatory biomarkers IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?, IL-17 and the acute phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP), which are elevated in older adults and associated with many chronic diseases of aging. Exploratory Aim 3. Examine relationships among improved adaptive immunity, inflammation and flu outcomes following naturally-acquired influenza infection using a full mediation model. Overall, this research will illuminate whether MBSR can slow the age-related changes in immunity known as immunosenescence, which is accelerated by chronic stress."
"9473652","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, is typically diagnosed after distant metastasis has occurred, and chemoresistance renders current treatments short-lived. Two major knowledge gaps exist in the field: we lack an understanding of early lesions and development of new anticancer drugs. HGSOC has been difficult to research and model due to debate over the most common cell of origin, which is now accepted to be the fallopian tube epithelium (FTE), and because the menstrual cycle plays a role in HGSOC development. No models of the disease previously existed, which incorporate both the fallopian tube and an ovary capable of recapitulating the human menstrual cycle. FemKube, the first female reproductive tract-on-a-chip, was created through a multi-institutional collaboration between the University of Illinois, Northwestern, and Draper Labs to support primary human fallopian tube tissues and murine ovaries, which are engineered to drive a physiologically accurate 28-day human menstrual cycle, in the setting of microfluidic flow. We will leverage this innovative technology to address both issues in the field by utilizing it to investigate early oncogenic events in the fallopian tube and to enhance the preclinical development of a promising new class of natural product chemotherapeutics, Phyllanthusmins (PHYs).  Our collaborative team has demonstrated the ability of FemKube to support growth of human fallopian tissues for the length of an accurately reproduced menstrual cycle. It is hypothesized that the FTE is damaged by secreted factors produced by the ovary during the follicular phase (first half of the menstrual cycle that encompasses follicle maturation), which is restored under the influence of progestins secreted from the corpus luteum (what remains of the follicle after ovulation) in the late luteal phase (second half of the menstrual cycle). Our first aim is to investigate how the cycling ovary impacts HGSOC initiation in the FTE by mapping DNA damage, proliferation, and apoptosis. We will use inhibitors of menstrual cycle hormones and nascent oncogenic mediators, such as known DNA mutators, inflammatory and growth factors, reactive oxygen species neutralizers and tumor suppressors, to mechanistically study HGSOC initiation in the FemKube system.  Our second aim seeks to incorporate our ability to culture primary human tissues in the FemKube system into the preclinical drug development pipeline. With the help our collaborators at the Ohio State University, we have developed a promising class of compounds derived from natural products, PHYs, with nanomolar potency on HGSOC cell lines in vitro. We will confirm PHY's apoptotic and anticancer abilities in vitro. We will demonstrate their efficacy on tumors ex vivo in the FemKube system and benchmark our findings against gold standard in vivo chemotherapeutic assays in mice. Overall, the introduction of FemKube technology will answer previously inaccessible questions on HGSOC initiation and enhance the drug development pipeline, thereby addressing key gaps in current ovarian cancer research."
"9596860","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candida albicans, the most commonly isolated human fungal pathogen, is responsible for a wide variety of systemic and mucosal infections. Immunocompromised individuals, including cancer patients on chemotherapy, AIDS patients, neonates, and organ transplant recipients, are particularly susceptible to infection. The ability of C. albicans to undergo a reversible morphological transition from single budding yeast cells to filaments (elongated cells attached end-to-end) is important for virulence as well as several virulence- related properties. While transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms that control the C. albicans morphological transition have been well-characterized, considerably less is known about the role of translational mechanisms. We have recently discovered that UME6, which encodes a key filament-specific transcriptional regulator of C. albicans morphology and virulence, possesses one of the longest 5? untranslated regions (UTRs) identified in fungi to date. The UME6 5? UTR inhibits C. albicans filamentation under a variety of inducing conditions as well as the ability of UME6 expression to determine C. albicans morphology. The 5? UTR does not affect UME6 transcript levels or induction kinetics, but instead specifically reduces translational efficiency of UME6, as determined by a polysome profiling analysis. Importantly, the level of translational inhibition directed by the UME6 5? UTR is modulated by different filament-inducing conditions. A recent preliminary ribosome profiling experiment indicates the presence of two distinct ribosome stalling sites in the UME6 5? UTR, both of which are located immediately upstream of predicted complex stable RNA secondary structures. An RNA-seq analysis has demonstrated that in addition to UME6, a significant number of C. albicans genes involved in filamentation, and a variety of other virulence-related processes, including biofilm formation, adhesion, and secreted degradative enzyme production, also possess long 5? UTRs. Based on this evidence, our hypothesis is that 5? UTR-mediated translational efficiency mechanisms play an important role in controlling C. albicans morphology, virulence and virulence-related processes in response to host environmental cues. In order to address this hypothesis, we plan to: 1) determine how C. albicans filamentous growth signaling pathways control morphology and Ume6 expression by regulating UME6 translational efficiency via the 5? UTR, 2) determine the molecular mechanism(s) by which the UME6 5? UTR inhibits translational efficiency, 3) determine the broader role of 5? UTR-mediated translational efficiency mechanisms in controlling C. albicans virulence and a variety of virulence-related properties. These studies will provide a better understanding of how 5? UTR-mediated translational efficiency mechanisms control morphology and virulence in a major human fungal pathogen. Ultimately, common fungal-specific components of translational efficiency mechanisms that regulate fungal pathogenicity could serve as potential targets for the development of novel and more effective antifungal strategies."
"9529343","The male-female health-survival paradox ? the phenomenon in modern human societies in which women experience greater longevity but higher rates of disability than men ? has far-reaching economic and medical implications. The PLs have spent the past five years carrying out the first examination of the health-survival paradox in a nonhuman animal, a population of wild baboons. Their results indicate that male baboons, along with males of several other primate species, have shorter lifespans than females, a pattern they share in common with humans. On the other hand, aging male baboons experience declines in health that are similar to or more rapid than those in females, making them different from humans in this respect. To move forward with comparative studies that can shed light on the health-survival paradox, the PLs propose to develop a more complete picture of commonalities and differences between humans and nonhuman primates in factors contributing to health and survival. To do so, the PLs will build on findings from the current Program Project grant to pursue four Aims. First, in work that cross-links with Project 2, the PLs will investigate sex differences in social status and social connectedness as risk factors for the steeper health declines seen in male baboons than in females. Because male baboons experience much steeper age-related declines in social status and social connectedness than females, these variables ? known to be risk factors for human health and survival ? are implicated as key sources of sex differences in this study system. Second, by observing and measuring rates of wound healing and recovery from illness in the baboons, the PLs will generate unique data for comparison with Project 2 on sex differences in recovery and survival after illness. Third, the baboons are a compelling model for understanding hormone profiles that depend on sex and social status, and this will allow the PLs to gain traction on the question of whether stress hormones mediate the relationship between social factors and survival. Fourth, in collaboration with Project 1, the PLs will use unique comparative data that has been gathered from multiple primate species to develop sophisticated modeling techniques that will allow the measurement of sex-specific mortality patterns with greater accuracy and for a wider range of species than ever before measured. Achieving these aims will provide crucial insight into the underpinnings of male-female differences in health and survival and the health-survival paradox."
"9540168","Abstract Quorum Sensing (QS), or bacterial communication by intercellular chemical signaling, is a process common to many (if not most) bacterial species; yet, it is unclear how QS signaling pathways contribute to virulence in many clinically significant pathogens. The Federle lab has helped to characterize a family of transcriptional regulators, known as Rgg proteins, as mediators of QS. We and others have shown the importance of Rgg proteins in multiple species of streptococci in regulating expression of genes that may enhance their ability to colonize and infect the host. Rgg proteins are known to regulate genes important for 1) controlling virulence; 2) promoting the development of resistance to lysozyme, a host-produced antimicrobial enzyme; 3) stimulating the formation of biofilms, or protective bacterial communities; 4) initiating the development of natural competence to take up DNA from the environment; and 5) promoting the ability to adhere to epithelial cells. The role of the Rgg proteins in the pathogenic lifestyle of the clinically significant pathogen S. pneumoniae has yet to be investigated, but published genome-level mutagenesis studies indicate Rgg proteins in this organism are critical in in vivo animal models of infection. We have constructed isogenic mutants for each Rgg protein important in vivo and have performed transcriptomic analysis to identify gene targets under Rgg- regulation. Our analysis has revealed 18 gene targets under regulation by the Rgg protein SP_0141 in the pneumococcal encapsulated strain TIGR4 (serotype 4). We are in the process of testing gene targets of interest in order to understand Rgg-mediated QS and its role in virulence. We will then explore the consequences of using QS to regulate mechanisms of pathogenesis in the presence of immune surveillance. Understanding the molecular networks under QS regulation and the advantage of using QS in the host will provide support for the possibility of modulating QS as an effective strategy for combatting pathogens."
"9538386","ABSTRACT Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) is an essential cellular enzyme that catalyzes the formation of S- adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the principal biological methyl donor and in liver, precursor of the key antioxidant glutathione (GSH). In mammals, two different genes, MAT1A and MAT2A, encode for two homologous MAT catalytic subunits, ?1 and ?2, respectively. MAT1A is primarily expressed in normal liver. Majority of patients with chronic liver disease have decreased expression and activity of MAT1A-encoded isoenzymes. We found MAT1A expression and hepatic SAMe levels are reduced in alcoholic hepatitis patients. While MAT isoenzymes are widely acknowledged for catalyzing cytosolic SAMe biosynthesis, our recent works have uncovered highly novel aspects of their functions. In addition to cytosol and nucleus, our preliminary data indicate MAT?1 is also present in the mitochondrial matrix to regulate mitochondrial function. This is important as we found hepatocytes lack the mitochondrial SAMe transporter SLC25A26. Using immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by mass spectrometry, we have identified many mitochondrial proteins and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) as MAT?1-interacting proteins. Our preliminary data show that MAT?1 negatively regulates CYP2E1 expression mainly at the protein level via methylation, which has not been reported. Importantly, MAT?1 mitochondrial targeting is impaired in murine and human alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and we propose two novel mechanisms that may cooperate in causing this impairment. The current proposal tests the central hypothesis that MAT?1 provides the SAMe source within the hepatocyte's mitochondrial matrix and impairment in MAT?1 mitochondrial targeting in ALD plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ALD. The corollary hypothesis is that MAT?1 maintains hepatocyte mitochondrial function in part by suppressing CYP2E1 expression. Here we follow up these novel findings in three specific aims: 1) examine how MAT?1 targets the mitochondria and why its targeting is impaired in ALD. We will elucidate how MAT?1 targets the mitochondria and mechanisms of its impaired targeting in ALD. We will test the novel hypothesis that this is due to 1) increased MAT?1 sumoylation and 2) increased interaction of MAT?1 with PIN1 (a peptidyl-prolyl cis- trans isomerase that recognizes a specific phosphorylated motif), 2) examine how MAT?1 regulates CYP2E1 protein expression. We will examine how MAT?1 regulates CYP2E1 protein stability at the molecular level and identify CYP2E1 residues and interacting proteins that participate in this process, 3) examine the role of mitochondrial MAT?1 and MAT?1-regulated CYP2E1 in ALD. We will test the novel hypothesis that preventing MAT?1 sumoylation or interaction with PIN1 will protect against reduced mitochondrial MAT?1 content and injury in ALD. We will also examine whether MAT?1 will protect against ALD by methylating CYP2E1 at R379 to enhance its degradation. If successfully accomplished, these studies will change existing paradigms on MAT?1 biology, CYP2E1 regulation and may uncover druggable targets for ALD."
"9586078","PROJECT SUMMARY Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are among the most urgent threats to global health, causing life-threatening illnesses and, increasingly, infections for which available antibiotics are simply ineffective. Particularly challenging is resistance against carbapenem antibiotics, an essential clinical barrier against MDR pathogens. Indeed, in 2013, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report which designated carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) as an immediate threat to public health that requires urgent and aggressive action. Also concerning is the worldwide emergence of resistance against colistin, a polymyxin antibiotic considered to be a last-line defense against MDR Gram-negative bacteria. Countering the spread of resistance determinants requires a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms affecting their transmission, including in the context of accumulated co-resistance against disparate classes of antibiotics. To address this important gap in scientific knowledge, we propose a forward- looking approach to elucidate a unique bacterial strategy that protects susceptible bacteria from antibiotic killing and promotes the genetic transmission of antimicrobial resistance. Specifically, our investigations will identify the role of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) produced by CRE in shielding and transforming carbapenem-susceptible bacteria, and define the influence of lipid A modification conferring colistin resistance on promoting these processes. Our innovative proposal will be accomplished by achieving two aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize the biogenesis, lipid A composition, and physiochemical properties of OMVs produced by isogenic colistin-susceptible and -resistant CRE. Protein/lipid quantification, advanced microscopy, immunoassays, and mass spectrometry-based analysis of lipid A will facilitate these studies. In Aim 2, we will determine the effect of colistin resistance on the carriage of bacterial protein and DNA as cargo, and the transmission of carbapenem resistance to susceptible bacteria. Quantitative proteomics, DNA sequencing, and phenotypic assays will form the basis of these investigations. Recent discoveries and preliminary findings by our group of investigators attest to the feasibility of this proposal and provide a complete framework for a) clarifying OMV-mediated transmission of antimicrobial resistance amongst bacteria and b) defining interconnected biological relationships between key resistance determinants. Our proposed research of MDR pathogens will inform infectious diseases epidemiology, prevention, and control programs, as well as the multifaceted functions of OMVs in bacterial pathogenesis and genetic exchange. Thus the current study is highly aligned with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases mission to understand, treat, and prevent disease, as well as its mandate to respond to emerging health threats. The focus of the proposed experiments also lends itself to translational avenues of investigation by highlighting novel targets for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for identifying and treating infections caused by MDR pathogens."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Title: Integrated Training in Neurocircuitry of Affective Disorders The proposed revised Institutional National Research Service Award Training Program will provide basic and clinical neuroscientists with the skills and mentor-guided experiences to propel them into an interdisciplinary research career designed to further the understanding of brain circuitry and affect. We request funds for two positions in Year 1 and four positions each subsequent year. The area of brain circuitry as applied to understanding psychopathology is a rapidly growing domain with great potential to inform the understanding of the causal pathways and mechanisms of affective mental illness. The Center for Neuromodulation in Depression and Stress (CNDS), in collaboration with multiple University of Pennsylvania (PENN) departments, centers and institutes is well poised to launch this novel post-doctoral fellowship based on established innovations in imaging, as well as the range of related expertise offered by the proposed multidisciplinary mentor group. The proposed training recognizes that the tools necessary to understand brain circuitry pathology require training across psychopathology, human neuroimaging methodology, statistics, engineering, neuroscience, genetics and basic translational models with associated imaging, such as optogenetics. The program will be guided by Dr. Yvette Sheline, (neuroimaging of depression and stress). Dr. John Detre (clinical neuroscience and methods development in functional neuroimaging) will be Associate Director. They are joined by numerous investigators at PENN with a rich track record of experience in imaging of affective disorders, including a cadre of investigators at the forefront of new methods development; many of these labs will be co-located, along with trainees, in a new facility. Research taking a brain circuit approach to psychopathology using a neuroscience model is a novel approach for training. The program mentors provide a unique multidisciplinary training environment in which to pursue this exciting new approach, given the established collaborations between neuroimaging researchers in the clinical and basic departments of the Perelman School of Medicine and their interface with the Biomedical Graduate Studies program. The University's role at the forefront of neuroimaging and translational neuroscience offers an opportunity to help train the next generation of young scientists who can pursue fundamental questions about abnormalities in brain circuitry in affective illness from the perspective of core psychological, neural and translational mechanisms that can inform and span traditional boundaries of psychopathology and lead to more effective treatments and identification of new targets for prevention."
"9473004","Project Summary The aging population and coincident rise in associated diseases demand a better understanding of the basic mechanisms of aging to design appropriate interventions and prolong human health. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the processes that slow aging, such as lifespan extension by caloric or dietary restriction, would provide prime candidates for therapeutic intervention. Model organisms have allowed major advances in defining aging mechanisms due to their exceptionally powerful genetics and analytical tools, and because these processes are evolutionarily conserved from humans to yeasts. We discovered a new pathway in Schizosaccharomyces pombe that both regulates autophagy and extends lifespan. Autophagy is a process that degrades and recycles proteins and organelles, and has been linked to lifespan and diseases associated with human aging. We found that both autophagy and lifespan are regulated through the cyclin-dependent kinase Pef1, an ortholog of human Cdk5. Pef1 acts with its cyclin Clg1 to limit lifespan and autophagy, and is opposed by the effector kinase Cek1 that extends lifespan and increases autophagy levels. The Clg1-Pef1- Cek1 pathway acts independently of TOR, the only other pathway known to regulate both lifespan and autophagy, but how these processes are controlled by the Pef1 pathway is unknown. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the Pef1 pathway senses nutrients to control lifespan and autophagy. This aim will be significant for testing the linkage between autophagy and lifespan extension by caloric or dietary restriction. Establishing the mechanism by which the Pef1 pathway regulates lifespan and autophagy requires knowing the downstream effectors, and Aim 2 describes a novel chemical genomics approach to identify Pef1 targets. We modified the Pef1 kinase to allow selective binding of ATP analogs that tag kinase substrates to allow their isolation, and used the Pef1 variant to identify the substrates. We identified substrates with predicted roles in autophagy and lifespan, as well as substrates that we hypothesize mediate Pef1 control through signaling pathways. Aim 2 will validate the substrates and identify substrates of the effector kinase Cek1. Aim 3 will determine how the phosphorylation of Pef1 and Cek1 substrates affects specific processes in lifespan and autophagy control, and will also use high-throughput functional characterization of substrates to reveal signaling pathways regulated by the Pef1 pathway. The strong functional homology between Pef1 and human Cdk5 indicates that the Clg1-Pef1-Cek1 pathway, its substrates and functions will be conserved in humans, which we will also test in Aim 3. The results of these proposed studies will provide a mechanistic framework for a new, conserved lifespan and autophagy-regulating pathway with important ramifications for healthy human aging."
"9497985","Understanding and Respecting End-of-Life Treatment Preferences Among Older Adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Project Summary/Abstract Cognitive impairment is extremely common near the end of life. Cognitive impairment often co-occurs with physical health conditions and the clinical progression of dementia and other chronic conditions can lead to frequent hospitalizations and situations requiring decisions about aggressive and potentially burdensome treatments that are unlikely to improve the survival or quality of life for these patients. Because cognitive impairment frequently precludes these patients from participating in decisions about their care, surrogate decision-makers must often make decisions quickly and with limited information about their loved ones' preferences. Although advance directives have been associated with less aggressive care for cognitively impaired patients, only a minority of cognitively impaired older adults prepare these documents. Expanded use of advance care planning (ACP) is viewed as a potential way of improving the quality of end-of-life care, but a number of questions remain. It is unclear whether cognitive functioning influences treatment preferences, how surrogate decision makers view treatment options, how they use preference information, and whether framing of treatment choices influences surrogate decision-making. In this project, an interdisciplinary team including researchers with expertise in economics, health policy, bioethics, critical care, mental health and nursing addresses three aims. The first two analyze new and existing survey data collected among Health and Retirement Study respondents and decedents to 1- Test whether decision-maker characteristics and the presence of written or oral directions influence the decisions currently being made for persons with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); 2- Describe the relationships between cognitive impairment, end-of-life treatment preferences, and advance care planning (ACP). Informed by Aims 1 and 2, aim 3- Conduct online experiments to test how the choices that American adults think surrogate decision-makers should make for persons with AD/ADRD vary with characteristics of patients' preferences and advanced care planning. Findings from this study will address evidence gaps around advance care planning for AD/ADRD highlighted in the NIA/NINR Funding Opportunity ?Improving Quality of Care and Quality of Life for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias at the End of Life,? and priorities articulated in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Results from this study can help to design interventions to increase the likelihood that a patient engaging in advance care planning has the conversations or prepares the documents that allow family, friends, and clinicians to act in a patient's best interest after dementia onset. Findings can also inform decision-making when ACP may no longer apply or was not completed."
"9617614","Chronic immune activation persists in a subset of HIV-infected individuals who are virally suppressed. The consequences of this activation include cognitive impairment, cardiovascular disease and metabolic abnormalities. While a functioning immune response is important to maintain good health, continued activation can be detrimental. Our work has concentrated on monocyte activation in HIV infection and the initiation as well as consequences of chronic immune activation, including cognitive impairment and downstream cellular effects. Interferon alpha (IFN?) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from HIV infection activate monocytes that release exosomes, which are membrane bound nanoparticles that contain functional proteins, mRNA and abundant small noncoding microRNAs (miR). These exosomes alone can enter and influence recipient cells. We have characterized the exosomes from activated monocytes and identified miRs that influence immune activation associated with HIV infection. Our overall hypothesis is that targeted exosomes carrying specific antagomiRs will decrease peripheral activation and may decrease HIV infection by silencing activated monocytes. This proposal will engineer exosomes targeted to CD16+ monocytes and containing antagomiRs to silence the activation associated with several miRs that cause downstream brain and cardiovascular inflammation. We will utilize a functional in vitro assay to confirm silencing. Once we identify antagomiRs that can effectively silence the inflammatory response we will use these targeted exosomes in a humanized HIV mouse model and evaluate the in vivo response."
"9481792","Abstract: The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing BubR1 protein abundance and function, and its role in the regulation of tumorigenesis and aging. Aging is the single greatest risk factor for cancer development, yet the mechanistic basis driving this interrelationship remains largely undefined. BubR1, a serine/threonine protein kinase, is involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to ensure faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis, and therefore is intimately linked to genomic integrity and cancer. Interestingly, recent studies have implicated BubR1 in the aging process where BubR1 abundance has been shown to decline in a variety of tissues as mammals age. Mice engineered to express low levels of BubR1 from birth die within a year, exhibiting increased senescence, premature aging phenotypes and an increased susceptibility to cancer, whereas mice overexpressing BubR1 have an extended lifespan with reduction in age- related diseases and cancer development. Senescence is believed to be largely tumor-suppressive and prevent cancer in young individuals. However, in aged individuals senescent cells can contribute to age-related cancer development. Therefore, BubR1 may play a pivotal role in the interrelationship between aging and cancer given that BubR1 suppresses both senescence and tumorigenesis. Previously, we identified an acetylation-dependent mechanism regulating BubR1 protein stability, where SIRT2 prevents degradation of BubR1 through deacetylation, leading to lifespan extension of a BubR1 premature aging mouse model. Furthermore, BubR1 protein levels in aged animals can be restored to youthful levels by stimulating SIRT2 activity through induction of NAD+ levels. These results suggest that the age-related decline in BubR1 levels can be reversed, potentially alleviating age-related diseases including cancer. Therefore, we hypothesize that BubR1 is a key tumor suppressor, and its loss with age increases cancer susceptibility. In this proposal, we plan to: 1) elucidate the physiological role of BubR1 post translational modifications during aging and calorie restriction and their impact on mitotic progression and tumorigenesis; and 2) determine the mechanisms regulating BubR1 protein abundance and function during aging. These studies will elucidate how regulation of BubR1 by post-translational modifications controls mitotic progression and tumorigenesis during aging as well as to identify mechanisms through which BubR1 declines with age and controls the aging processes. Given that aging poses the largest single risk factor for developing cancer, elucidating the molecular details governing the physiological role of BubR1 in cancer and aging will provide mechanistic understanding of the interrelationship between aging and cancer development, as well as identify possible therapeutic strategies to treat age-related diseases."

"9450503","Light chain amyloidosis (AL) is the most common form of systemic amyloid disease, with an estimated 4,500 new cases each year in the US. AL is a complex plasma cell-related disease characterized by the formation of insoluble, immunologically-inert protein fibrils composed of misfolded monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain components Extracellular amyloid fibrils can deposit in any organ or tissue causing loss of function, morbidity, and, ultimately, death. Despite decades of active research and increased understanding of pathological mechanisms, AL remains incurable, and the prognosis for patients is poor with a median survival of less than 3 years.  Effective clinical management of patients with AL requires, in addition to chemotherapy, removal of destructive tissue amyloid so that organ function can be allowed to recover. A proven method of amyloid removal is opsonization of the deposits by using amyloid-reactive antibodies. Although promising, preliminary results from two ongoing clinical trials of anti-AL amyloid antibodies indicate that they may be effective in only approximately 50% of patients. To address this deficiency we have developed a strategy that uses a novel bifunctional ?peptope? ? that combines a pan-amyloid-reactive peptide and a linear epitope sequence ? to enhance the efficacy and extend the utility of current immunotherapeutic antibodies, such as the chimeric reagent, 11-1F4.  In this proposal, we will evaluate and characterize a peptope comprised of the amyloid-reactive peptide p5+14 and a high affinity epitope (0.3 nM) recognized by 11-1F4. Using a battery of quantitative in vitro binding assays as well as in vivo dual-energy SPECT imaging and tissue biodistribution studies, we will quantify the efficacy of peptope-mediated amyloid targeting of the 11-1F4 antibody. Finally, we will investigate, using mouse models of systemic and localized amyloidosis, the ability of peptope-antibody immunotherapy to induce amyloid removal in vivo. We anticipate that this novel, two-stage opsonizing immunotherapy will enhance the efficacy of 11-1F4-based therapy in patients with AL and potentially extend the utility of this antibody to other forms of systemic amyloid disease.  AL amyloidosis remains a devastating and incurable disease. The goal of this application is to develop bifunctional peptides that simultaneously bind amyloid and the 11-1F4 monoclonal antibody to generate a novel immunotherapy for AL amyloidosis. This approach will complement and extend current antibody-based therapies for amyloid removal, thereby restoring organ function and securing long term survival and remission for patients with AL."

"9478871","Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 5.3 million people in the US. Currently, there are no blood or laboratory tests linked to the pathology that can provide a conclusive early diagnosis of AD. The lack of such tests has hampered the development and successful use of potentially beneficial AD therapies. In view of this, the broad, long-term objective of the proposed study is to develop accurate and reliable blood tests that can be used for detection of preclinical and prodromal AD (i.e., at mild cognitive impairment, MCI) as well as for monitoring AD progression from the preclinical stage to MCI and later AD stages. Our previous studies using human protein microarrays have shown that all humans possess thousands of autoantibodies in their blood and that individual autoantibody profiles are influenced by the presence of disease. We have exploited disease-specific changes in autoantibody profiles to identify biomarkers useful for diagnosing patients with prodromal AD at MCI and mild-moderate disease stages as well as early- and moderate-stage Parkinson?s disease with high sensitivity and specificity. In this proposed study, we will utilize autoantibodies as blood-based biomarkers and human protein microarrays as a testing platform to validate the selected MCI biomarkers with an independent patient cohort to test the ability of these biomarkers to identify patients at MCI and preclinical stages of AD. The following aims are proposed: Specific Aim #1 is to carry out a replication or validation study of early detection of AD at the prodromal (MCI) stage in subjects with low CSF Abeta42 levels and confirm disease stage- and disease-specificity using serum samples from an independent cohort of ADNI MCI subjects who subsequently transitioned to AD. To test the linkage between the efficacy of MCI biomarkers and early AD pathology, Specific Aim #2 will determine the effects of CSF Abeta42 level and cortical amyloid load as pathological indicators of early AD pathology on the overall accuracy, including disease staging and disease specificity, of the MCI biomarker panel. As a result of the high overall accuracy of our MCI biomarker panel in distinguishing MCI subjects with low CSF Abeta42 levels from controls shown in our previous study, Specific Aim #3 is to determine the utility of the prodromal AD (MCI) biomarkers for preclinical detection of AD. Here, the MCI biomarker panel will be probed using sera from subjects who originally enrolled in ADNI as healthy controls, but later transitioned to MCI or full-blown AD. Controls will be ADNI subjects who also enrolled as healthy controls but showed no clear signs of cognitive decline over the same time period. The development of an accurate, relatively noninvasive, inexpensive and early blood-based diagnostic test for AD will be of great benefit to patients afflicted with this disease, since early treatment greatly increases the likelihood of a successful outcome. In addition, it would facilitate earlier enrollment into AD clinical trials, and would enable monitoring of AD progression in patients who are under treatment by their physicians or participating as subjects in clinical trials for new potential therapeutics."
"9624947","Abstract  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection can lead to tuberculosis (TB) disease, causing ~9 million new infections and ~1.8 million deaths globally, every year. A quarter of these are deaths due to the TB/AIDS comorbidity, caused by Mtb/HIV co-infection and the resulting reactivation of LTBI. The resurgence of TB in the last two decades can be attributed to the failure of the anti-TB vaccine, Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in containing adult, pulmonary TB as well, the emergence of drug-resistance and the AIDS pandemic. The failure to control TB stems from the lack of complete understanding of the virulence and pathogenesis programs utilized by this highly specialized and successful pathogen in order to persist in the lungs of its hosts. As part of its virulence cycle, Mtb modulates host immunity. We have developed a robust macaque model Mtb/HIV co-infection, by using natural routes of Mtb infection and by using Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) as a surrogate for HIV. This model can be leveraged to study the physiology of Mtb in a true in-vivo setting. Using our model, we show that the expression of IDO (INDO, IDO1), a powerful immunosuppressant of activated CD4+ T cells, is dramatically enhanced in the lung granulomata of macaques. Levels of IDO are induced in a bacterial burden specific manner in myeloid cells. Thus, macaques that control inhaled Mtb infection as LTBI, do not express high levels of IDO in lung lesions, but those that progress to ATB do. IDO levels decline when animals with ATB are chemotherapeutically treated. Upon co-infection with SIV, 2/3rds of the macaques with LTBI reactivate disease - only these animals exhibited lung IDO induction. Finally, nonpathogenic infection with avirulent mutants of Mtb failed to elicit the induction of IDO. Amelioration of IDO enzymatic activity by an FDA, approved, safe compound in-vivo resulted in significant reduction in clinical signs of TB, pathology and bacterial burden, and increased survival. This was accompanied by increased lung T cell proliferation and induction of bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT). These events reshaped the granuloma is two different ways: i) functionally granulomas from treated (IDO blockaded) animals exhibited no signatures of T cell exhaustion but instead higher expression of T cell differentiation, apoptosis, bacterial killing and lung tissue remodeling pathways; ii) morphologically, greater relocation of T cells was observed to the center of the granulomata. The profoundly better killing of Mtb in macrophages by CD4+ T cells could be modeled in-vitro, in a novel macaque macrophage:CD4+ T cell co- culture system. Our results strongly suggest that IDO modulates a complex immune/metabolic signaling network that promotes bacterial survival, immune dysfunction and disease. Thus, inhibition of IDO is a prime target for adjunctive HDT against the multidrug resistant TB epidemic. Based on these data, we postulate that IDO1-signaling is key to modulating immune responses in human-like lung granulomas. We now propose to leverage the macaque model of LTBI to study if IDO-blockade in-vivo can enhance granuloma performance and sterilize Mtb infection. SIV co-infection will be used to test this. Finally, we will treat Mtb/SIV co-infected animals with a gut homing T cell blocking a4b7 antibody in addition to blockading IDO. We postulate that this dual treatment will reduce the viral load thus preventing reactivation, and enhance the sterilizing potential of IDO blockade."
"9468335","This application for Translational Basic and Clinical Research Training in Rheumatology, under the leadership of Dr. Jill Buyon ? Director of the Division of Rheumatology at NYU, who brings translational expertise in SLE and long-standing mentorship ? is based on several years of rapid growth and attentive reflection with clear purpose: to support trainees through extended development toward leadership roles and meaningful contributions in science and medicine. Since the standard 2-year fellowship is simply not adequate to prepare fellows for academic careers, this program addresses the need to extend traditional ACGME training. We seek support for 3 physician postgraduates and 1 pre-doctoral MD/PhD trainee to establish an early pipeline to Rheumatology. During a brief hiatus after >30 years of uninterrupted NIAMS T32 funding, the Division has transitioned leadership; re-expanded the ACGME fellowship from 3 to 4 positions annually; fostered advancement of junior faculty with new tenure-track appointments; recruited faculty to fill unmet needs in rheumatology- focused basic science; established centers of translational research that include MiCRA (NYU Microbiome Center for Rheumatology and Autoimmunity), the Colton Center for Autoimmunity, and the Psoriatic Arthritis Center; and instituted SAMPLE (Specimen And Matched Phenotype Linked Evaluation), an IRB-approved biorepository utilizing a uniform consent to provide a shared division-wide resource for clinical and bench researchers. At the core of this proposal is interdisciplinary training along two methodologically distinct research tracks: reinvigoration of basic science career pathways, and clinical research encouraging inquiry relating to disparities and community engagement consistent with the populations we serve. In many cases the enriched training will include an advanced degree. Each track bears the prefix ?translational? ? be it basic or clinical ? to emphasize the common purpose of all healthcare investigators. An Early Scientist Pathway will be offered to MD/PhD candidates (translational-basic track only), with recruitment accomplished by partnering with the directors of the NYU MD/PhD and graduate programs in Immunology/Inflammation and Cell/Molecular Biology. Both tracks are grounded in core disease clusters reflecting faculty expertise and recognized leadership: 1) lupus and diseases of systemic autoimmunity; 2) inflammatory and autoimmune arthritis; and 3) degenerative and metabolic bone disease. Each track incorporates common and highly customized didactics; individualized research training experiences with a project team of Primary, Associate, and Methodological Mentors to bring clinical context to the bench and vice versa; an Advisory Career Development Committee; and planning to support post-T32 advancement to faculty positions. Programmatic success will be evaluated though quarterly meetings of the Executive Committee, semiannual meetings of the External Advisory Committee, and an Annual Retreat. Institutional commitment is strong with support for infrastructure and internal funding for physician- scientists. The NYU-HHC CTSI provides extensive resources available for the proposed training program."
"9696605","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large disparities in HIV rates in black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are not explained by higher engagement in risky behaviors and are particularly high among younger MSM. Despite the efficacy of several prevention interventions, reducing these disparities requires approaches that maximally engage these men's social and sexual networks. Because of frequently transient life circumstances, disruption of social and sexual networks and HIV transmission overlap with other groups, criminal justice involved (CJI) BMSM who use substances represent an important target for intervention. Although effective behavioral and structural interventions exist that target CJI populations, their successful implementation for CJI BMSM networks and communities has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, research to determine intervention impact at these larger social units is costly and does not readily lend itself to the randomized control trial approach. This proposal aims to utiliz a systems dynamic approach using an agent-based model (ABM) to estimate the effectiveness of HIV prevention and substance-abuse interventions for CJI substance-using BMSM.  Our project brings together investigators with a proven track record in the study of BMSM, criminal justice settings, substance-abuse intervention, social network analysis, ABMs and HIV clinical care provision. We will adapt a previously developed core open access ABM platform (using Repast Simphony) that includes baseline national data on people and households by geography, as well as the dynamic features of the target population such as incarceration, health center, and activity (time-use) data. We will scale the ABM to three counties: Harris TX, Los Angeles CA, and Cook IL where our team has collected data for model parameterization. Our approach will assess the interplay between social and behavioral variables and viral and host factors in a matter that will be adaptive to temporal, network and setting-specific changes. Our aims are to: 1) Build upon our flexible ABM by incorporating HIV transmission and suppression probabilities at the individual level, including host/viral factors and biologic/behavioral data from HIV prevention and substance-abuse intervention studies; 2) Parameterize this ABM with multiple network data sources available to investigators in each city on specific transition periods of BMSM from the community, to jail, and back to the community/ supervision; such shocks lead to social and sexual network formation and disruption. We will supplement these data with newly collected data (n=50/city) specifically on network shocks and HIV prevention and treatment utilization during these critical transition periods; 3) Simulate HIV prevention interventions within criminal justice contexts using the model parameterized in Aim 2. Because our open access Repast Simphony ABM platform is widely used, we will make model parameters, specifications and variables publically available. This will allow for external validation of our findings and for additional use of the core model by others for context and community-specific integrated HIV prevention and treatment planning in at risk populations."
"9483756","This research will determine if red blood cell (RBC) units from iron-deficient volunteer blood donors fail to meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards for 24-hour post-transfusion recovery. Over 15 million RBC units are donated annually in the United States. Despite fulfilling all requirements for blood donation, almost two- thirds of the women, and half of the men, who are regular blood donors are iron deficient. RBCs from iron- deficient donors may be specifically damaged by refrigerated storage, thus decreasing their post-transfusion recovery and lifespan in circulation. Our overarching hypothesis is that a substantial proportion of RBC units from iron-deficient volunteer donors are suboptimal. To this end, we propose a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of iron-deficient, regular blood donors. In Aim #1, we will determine whether RBCs from iron-deficient blood donors meet the FDA standards for 24-hour post-transfusion recovery. In Aim #2, we will determine whether intravenous iron repletion improves the 24-hour recovery of a second, similarly stored, autologous RBC unit. This project will fill critical gaps in knowledge by (i) identifying an unrecognized source of impaired RBC recovery in standard products, (ii) identifying an innovative way to identify donors whose RBC units have impaired tolerance for refrigerated storage using RBC zinc protoporphyrin levels, and (iii) developing a clinical strategy to avoid these adverse effects through iron repletion. This new information will help identify ways to improve the safety and efficacy of RBC transfusions. For example, RBCs that do not circulate cannot deliver oxygen. Thus, measures to improve post-transfusion RBC recovery could lead to sustained improvements in patient outcomes, particularly in those requiring chronic transfusion, where long-term circulation of the maximal number of transfused RBCs is vital, such as patients with sickle-cell disease and ?-thalassemia."
"9546056","A major issue in the management of brain tumors is their aggressive growth and invasion into surrounding normal brain tissue. Unfortunately, our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the aggressive behavior of these tumors is very limited. Recent evidence indicates that the invasiveness of solid tumors involves signaling events downstream of Rho GTPases. The Rho family of small GTPases in general and RhoA in particular, are critical regulators of directed cell migration, cell division, and monolayer patency. Our basic research findings on the mechanics of cell migration have identified the Rho guanine exchange factor (GEF) Syx as important in promoting directed cell migration, via its interaction with members of the Crumbs polarity complex, and activation of RhoA signaling. Interestingly, Syx is highly expressed in human gliomas. Preliminary studies show that in addition to suppressing cell migration, depletion of Syx drastically impairs glioma cell division, and significantly improves animal survival in a xenograft mouse model of GBM. Additionally, inhibition of Syx signaling in cultured glioma cells strongly synergizes with Temozolomide (TMZ), the standard of care therapy for GBM. The overall scientific premise of this project is that Syx signaling plays a key role in GBM cell growth, migration and invasion, as well as in responsiveness to chemotherapeutics. As such, we hypothesize that therapeutic targeting of the Syx-RhoA signaling axis can suppress both the aggressive growth and invasion of human gliomas and synergize with standard-of-care therapy. To further characterize the role of Syx in the aggressive growth and invasiveness of human GBM and to test the efficacy of targeting Syx signaling in combination with standard GBM therapy, we will use cultured cells, organotypic cultures, animal models of human GBM, as well as human GBM tissue samples, to:  1. Characterize the effect of Syx depletion on GBM aggressiveness.  2. Identify key components of the Syx-RhoA signaling axis.  3. Determine whether inhibition of Syx can enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutics."
"9541868","NRSA F31 APPLICATION ?Effect of Toluene on the Prefrontal-Amygdala Pathway and Risky Behavior? PI: Kevin M. Braunscheidel Sponsor: John J. Woodward ABSTRACT Volatile organic solvents like toluene cause intoxication and neurochemical alterations when inhaled at high concentrations. These include electrophysiological and morphological changes in cortical (e.g. medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) and subcortical regions common among many addictive substances. As revealed by our lab, ex vivo application of toluene causes a persistent depression of excitatory signaling in the mPFC that is dependent on endocannabinoids. The behavioral consequences of this action are not currently known, but it is possibly responsible for the loss of executive control over complex behaviors such as decision making in the face of risky outcomes. Aim 1 of this proposal will measure the effect of acute toluene intoxication on risky decision making in rodents using a semi-automated task termed probabilistic discounting. Appropriate responding in this task depends on functional connectivity between the mPFC and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). The BLA is traditionally viewed as mediating fear-related behaviors, but also clearly plays a role in addiction to abused substances including cocaine and alcohol. Virtually nothing is known about the role of the BLA in solvent-induced disruption of risky decision making and studies in this proposal will use in vivo fiber photometry combined with targeted viral delivery of calcium sensing GCaMP6 to determine which specific components of this task depend on mPFC-BLA connectivity. To provide the first characterization of the cellular actions of solvents on BLA neuron excitability, studies in Aim 2 will use whole-cell patch clamp brain slice electrophysiology to measure the effect of toluene on the intrinsic excitability of BLA neurons. The effects of toluene on mPFC-specific synaptic transmission will be assessed by optogenetically activating mPFC terminals and recording glutamatergic post- synaptic currents in voltage clamped BLA neurons. Follow up studies will use optical plasticity protocols to determine how toluene alters the ability of BLA neurons to modify synaptic strength. Completing these aims will provide outstanding training in behavioral pharmacology, fiber photometry, and slice electrophysiology and will address an important shortcoming in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying toluene?s effect on complex behaviors."
"9623610","Project Summary HIV infection begins with fusion of viral and target cell membranes, driven by the viral envelope glycoprotein [Env; trimeric (gp160)3 cleaved to (gp120/gp41)3]. Gp120 binding to primary receptor CD4 and coreceptor (e.g. chemokine receptor CCR5 or CXCR4) trigger large structural rearrangements in gp41 that drive the membrane fusion process. Encounter of the coreceptor by gp120 is believed to be the crucial trigger for gp41 refolding events, which promotes membrane fusion. It has been two decades since CCR5 and CXCR4 were first identified as the coreceptors for HIV-1 entry, but we still do not have a clear picture, in particular, at atomic resolution, of how the coreceptor recognizes HIV-1 Env, except for some speculative molecular modeling. The coreceptors are chemokine receptors with seven transmembrane-spanning segments (7TMs) and belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Crystal structures have been reported for heavily modified CCR5 and CXCR4, revealing the general architecture of these receptors, as well as their interactions with the various ligands, but the structures fall short of explaining the molecular details of how these chemokine receptors function as HIV-1 coreceptors. In this proposal, we plan to gain a better understanding of the HIV-1 coreceptor function of CCR5 and CXCR4 and to provide high-resolution pictures of how they interact with HIV- 1 Env to promote viral entry. We hypothesize that an extensive interface between gp120 and the coreceptor involving multiple structural elements is required for their high-affinity interaction. We have already purified a stable complex of HIV-1 gp120, 4 domain CD4 and an unmodified human CCR5, and demonstrated the feasibility to carry out electron microscopy (EM) studies. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) have revolutionized the field of structural biology and produced numerous high-resolution structures. To capitalize on these advances, we will tackle a challenging problem that is important to both the HIV and GPCR fields. We will pursue following specific aims: 1) we will determine the high-resolution structure of the complex of CD4-gp120-CCR5 by cryoEM; 2) we will determine the high-resolution structure of the complex of CD4-gp120-CXCR4; 3) we will elucidate the role of key structural elements of CCR5 or CXCR4 in coreceptor function by structure-guided mutagenesis."
"9675528","Project Summary: The internal mechanics of proteins ? the coordinated motion of amino acids and the pattern of forces constraining these motions ? connects protein structure and function. The biologically relevant motions are potentially quite subtle, distributed widely over the tertiary structure, and likely to cover a broad range of time scales. Current biophysical methods do not offer a route to a complete description of these motions, a problem that severely limits our understanding of protein structure, function, and evolution. Here, we propose a completely new approach to this problem involving the application of strong electric fields to protein crystals with simultaneous time-resolved x-ray diffraction to observe the resulting motions in spatial and temporal detail. Preliminary work provides strong justification for development and application of this method, called EF/TRX, and motivates a set of interesting experiments to explore the power of this approach for exposing the structural basis for complex protein functions. EF/TRX involves considerable technical and conceptual innovations, but the completion of the work described here should enable broad usage of this new method by the scientific community and stimulate further development. More fundamentally, the experiments proposed will lay the foundation for understanding the mechanical basis of protein function."
"9453677","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Safe and effective approaches for the treatment of obesity are needed to address the tremendous burdens of this disease such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and even some cancers. Although studied as distinct pathways for decades, processes regulating eating and motivation are now thought to be driven by overlapping neural circuits. Studying this overlap may provide important insights into the basis of excess caloric intake and lead to the identification of novel pharmacological targets for treating metabolic diseases, the long-term goal of our research. A potential novel and innovative target in this regard is neuromedin U (NMU), a peptide shown to suppress food intake and cause weight loss. These effects of NMU are related to its actions at the NMU receptor 2 (NMUR2) in the hypothalamus, particularly in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which is enriched for NMUR2. We have previously found that selective depletion of NMUR2 in the PVN of rats potentiates the intake of a high-fat diet, increases weight gain, and enhances a dietary preference specifically for fat but not sucrose. The goals of the present project are to explore NMUR2 signaling as a key interface between the hypothalamic and mesolimbic systems, and to further evaluate the action of NMUR2 agonists on feeding behavior. Our preliminary data indicate that NMUR2 neurons in the hypothalamus are directly connected to the nucleus accumbens, a key region of the mesolimbic system that regulates reward and motivated behavior. We have, for the first time, evaluated small-molecule NMUR2 agonists in vivo. Our preliminary data indicate that these compounds suppress feeding on a high-fat diet. To accomplish our goals, our Specific Aims are 1) To evaluate the structural link between the hypothalamic and mesolimbic circuits, 2) To establish a functional link between these areas involving enkephalins and opioid signaling, and 3) To determine if NMUR2 is a target to inhibit motivation for high-fat food and regulation of metabolic physiology. These aims will be achieved using such innovative technologies as viral-vector tracers to map neural pathways in the brain, optical clearing with CLARITY visualize these pathways in clarified, intact brains, and virus-mediated RNA interference study the effects of the NMUR2 gene on food intake, body weight, and motivation for food. Overall, these studies will lay the foundation for understanding neural pathways that regulate motivation for food, and for future work developing NMUR2-based therapeutics for the treatment of obesity."
"9592770","Project Summary: The neural circuit that regulates birdsong, a highly precise, learned sensorimotor behavior, excels for study of fundamental mechanisms of adult circuit plasticity. The song system is a unique model of naturally occurring degeneration and compensatory regeneration in a behaviorally relevant neural circuit in adult brains. This circuit shows exaggerated seasonal degeneration and reconstruction via neurogenesis, in response to changes in circulating steroid hormone levels. Our long-term goal is to understand the fundamental mechanisms by which steroid hormones and neurotrophins interact to regulate plasticity of neural circuits and behavior. On a translational level, our goal is to understand how forebrain circuits can regenerate to support performance of complex learned motor skills. The central hypothesis of the proposed aims is that seasonal changes in hormones trigger changes in anterograde and retrograde trophic signaling that lead to remodeling of the HVC-RA circuit and changes in song behavior in adult birds.The goal of this application is to identify the trophic signaling pathways (molecular and electrophysiological) that regulate the the incorporation of newborn neurons to regenerate this circuit. This research will advance the field by elucidating fundamental issues of adult circuit plasticity. This topic is of translational relevance for exploiting endogenous or exogenous stem cells for therapeutic repair of injured or dysfunctional circuits in humans. These fundamental issues include whether new neurons added to adult circuits establish functional connections with efferent nuclei and restore behavior (Aim 1), the role of activity regulated genes in mediating retrograde trophic effects of neuronal activity on presynaptic adult neurogenesis (Aim 2), the role of calcium channels in mediating the transsynaptic neurotrophic regulation of postsynaptic activity (Aim 3), and the role of pre- and/or postsynaptic neuronal activity in maintaining a regenerated adult circuit (Aim 4)."
"9480102","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a five-year training program for Dr. Cagnina to establish a career as an independent investigator in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine. Under the guidance of co-mentors Drs. Borna Mehrad and Tom Braciale, our broad, long-term objective is for Dr. Cagnina to gain new the knowledge and skills necessary to evolve into an independent physician-scientist, while making significant contributions to understanding the immune response to Aspergillus. Aspergillus species are ubiquitous molds that cause clinical disease in hosts with impaired immunity or abnormal mucosal defenses. Neutrophils play a key role in host defenses against this pathogen but little is known about the contribution of these cells in in this context beyond their direct microbicidal role. We have previously shown that, during host response to Aspergillus in the lung, neutropenia results in a defect in the traffic and maturation of inflammatory monocyte-derived dendritic cells. In the preliminary data for this proposal, we report that deficiency in neutrophil reactive oxygen species production is sufficient to induce this phenotype; that, in hosts unable to generate reactive oxygen species, both the inflammatory dendritic cell recruitment and lung injury are dependent on TNF; and that neutropenia impairs the development of protective immunity against the pathogen. We therefore seek to test the hypothesis that in response to Aspergillus, reactive oxygen species-dependent neutrophil signaling to inflammatory dendritic cells mediates (a) protection from acute lung injury and (b) generation of protective adaptive immunity against Aspergillus. We will test this under two specific aims: (1) To identify the mechanism by which neutrophil-derived ROS modulates dendritic cell function during the innate immune response to Aspergillus and (2) To define the role of neutrophil ROS in the development of protective adaptive immunity against Aspergillus. The proposed studies are relevant to public health by defining a new mechanism of host defense against an important human pathogen that should allow for future development of novel therapeutics or preventative strategies."
"9675658","Social determinants of risk and attitudes about asbestos in a Superfund Environmental Justice  community: The broad objective of this proposal is to conduct an environmental epidemiologic and  ethnographic study of asbestos-related disease among residents of Ambler, Pennsylvania, one of the largest  asbestos waste sites in the US where there was substantial industrial and community exposure to asbestos  from the late 1800s through the late 1980s. The known adverse health effects of asbestos exposure in work  settings raise the possibility of analogous effects from community level exposure. The Pennsylvania  Department of Health has identified in the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry an excess of cases of  mesothelioma in the Ambler zip code, finding a 2.7 times higher than expected rate among men and a 4.5  times higher than expected rate among women. However, a combination of circumstances including out-  migration of families from the area following closure of the asbestos industry, the long latency period  characteristic of asbestos related diseases, the under-reporting of lung diseases in earlier periods, and the  mismatch between administrative boundaries and actual exposure to asbestos, may have affected the ability  of standard public health surveillance methods to fully capture the magnitude of the problem in this area. We  propose to build on Department of Health findings and on our own previous pilot work in which we used  ethnographic methods to delineate parameters of the relevant communities of exposure and to describe  normative lifestyle patterns and circumstances of potential asbestos exposure. In the process of developing  these data, we have formed strong relationships with these communities which will facilitate our access to  current and past residents and workers to conduct a geographic case control study to analyze the  contribution of community, occupational and social factors among individuals who developed mesothelioma.  Specifically, we will determine the association between the development of mesothelioma and geographic  proximity to the plant and asbestos waste piles that had been publicly discarded in the Ambler area. Our  study design is based on the following hypotheses: 1). The incidence of mesothelioma is related to  both occupational and non-occupational (community exposures) in the Ambler area; 2) There is an  association between the incidence of mesothelioma and proximity of residence to the asbestos waste  sites and 3) The relationships between proximity to the site and mesothelioma are modified by  various social, lifestyle and economic factors that influence asbestos exposure. These hypotheses will  be tested under the following Specific Aims: Aim 1) To utilize an ethnographic approach with residents to  identify patterns of exposure related to lifestyle and social factors to inform the case control analysis. Aim 2)  To identify, characterize and map all cases of mesothelioma in Ambler Borough and the four adjacent  townships. Aim 3) To identify a set of controls that are frequency matched with cases based upon a minimum  five year residence in the area . Aim 4) To use a geographic case-control design to characterize the  contribution of geographic factors found among people who developed mesothelioma in the greater Ambler  area."
"9462877","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes future work of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC). The goal is to deconstruct the complete genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to determine how all inherited factors contribute to the AD phenotype. To this end we will identify, annotate, replicate, and validate all DNA variants that increase risk or protect against AD, determine what genes are connected to these variants, and evaluate the contribution of each to total AD risk. The rationale for the following genetics/genomics project is to: 1) Predict who will develop AD. 2) Fully reveal all AD genetics in all ethnic groups. 3) Understand the pathogenesis of AD. 4) Identify novel therapeutic targets for AD. Therefore, we will identify new genes/therapeutic targets for AD using methods that make use of data from not only genotyping arrays but also massively parallel DNA sequence approaches. Because much of what we know about AD genetics comes from Caucasians AD studies, we will focus future analysis on not only Caucasians but also on African Americans, Latinos, and Asians. To resolve AD genetics, we will: in AIM 1, use functional genomics to identify AD risk and protective variants in cis- acting regulatory elements, and identifying the genes affected by these CREs; in AIM 2, we will use in silico systems biology approaches to integrate information from all AD genes to identify interaction networks and pathways relevant to AD; in AIM 3, we will identify additional AD rare-variant genes using gene-based (including CREs) analyses. All ethnic groups will be analyzed by these methods; in AIM 4, we will perform whole exome sequencing on African American subjects to generalize findings made on Caucasians, to refine gene localization, to identify novel variants, and to identify novel genes found only in other ethnic groups. This will be followed up by targeted sequencing in African Americans and Latinos; in AIM 5 we will assemble and harmonize phenotypes available in multiple cohorts to identify subtypes of AD and genes associated with variants associated with those subtypes."
"9499606","Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is associated with long-lasting behavioral changes in animal models and humans. In response to environmental cues, epigenetic programs regulate gene expression in matured neurons via chromatin modifications and DNA methylation resulting in enduring neurophysiological changes. There is mounting evidence to implicate the involvement of dysfunctional epigenetic programs in many cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, establishing a causal link between epigenetic mechanism and neuronal properties that underlie behavioral adaptation in complex nervous systems has been difficult, mainly due to the paucity of behaviorally relevant neural and genetic substrates that are targeted by epigenetic regulation. Our goal is to determine the epigenetic basis of sensory experience-dependent changes in neurophysiology and behavior. We take advantage of the anatomical simplicity and the powerful genetic toolkit of the Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) involved in courtship behaviors, and the well- established Drosophila male courtship behavior, a robust ritualistic behavior governed by a single gene, fruitlessM (fruM) expressed in approximately 2000 interconnected neurons. Our pilot experiments and recent studies show that olfactory experience enhances the response of the Or47b and Ir84a ORNs in males and male courtship behavior. We also have linked olfactory receptor (OR) signaling through calcium, and histone acetyl transferase p300 to the expression of the transcriptional factor fruM as a molecular mechanism by which olfactory experience regulates neurophysiology and behavior. We hypothesize that fly and food odors in the environment lead to chromatin dependent changes in fruM transcription in sensory neurons to modify neurophysiology and courtship behavior with olfactory experience. To test this, we will first determine the effect of chromatin modulation by p300 on reprogramming neurophysiology and behavior. Next, we will characterize the molecular mechanisms by which olfactory experience and chromatin modulates fruM expression. Finally, we will determine the transcriptional and chromatin changes in ORNs with olfactory experience. ."
"9516242","Project Summary/Abstract Physiological profiling of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm subpopulations The association of microorganisms into biofilms produces functionally organized microbial structures that promote community survival in a wide range of environments. Much like individual cells within a multicellular organism express different genes from the same DNA base, individual microbial cells located within different regions of a biofilm structure can exhibit distinct genetic programs. These spatially-defined regions of physiologically-differentiated cells are reminiscent of the role of tissues in multicellular organisms, with specific subpopulations in the microbial community serving defined roles to promote the overall health of the biofilm. In this proposal, we seek to assess the function of the subpopulations that we recently identified within the biofilm communities of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on previous knowledge of the physiological functions of biofilm subpopulations gleaned from studies focused on model microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, it is likely that these populations serve one of two major functions: (1) individual resistance to an environmental stressor, enabling subsequent proliferation of single microbial cells within the community to ensure ultimate survival of the microbial strain or (2) the production of shared resources which promote survival of the entire community. The study of subpopulation functionality is particularly important in the context of P. aeruginosa biofilm communities because most infections caused by this organism are mediated by biofilm formation (e.g. infections of wounds, the urinary tract, and the cystic fibrosis lung). The long-term goal of this project is to identify drugs targeting specific biofilm subpopulations. The rationale of this application is that the recent discovery of new P. aeruginosa biofilm subpopulations enables physiological profiling of these populations to identify targetable weaknesses. Our overall hypothesis is that the targeting of subpopulations responsible for producing shared resources can disrupt the entire community to promote clearance of the biofilm. The experiments outlined in this proposal will not only define the community functions of P. aeruginosa subpopulations but will reveal metabolic susceptibilities (the ?Achilles heel?) of these communities, which can be exploited for subsequent therapeutic targeting."
"9538332","ABSTRACT  While the epitranscriptomic regulation of viral RNA function has begun to attract considerable attention, this work has so far focused entirely on a single epitranscriptomic modification, i.e., the addition of a methyl group to the N6 position of adenosine (m6A). This focus is understandable, given that m6A is the most common epitranscriptomic modification of cellular mRNAs and it has been known for ~40 years that viral transcripts also contain high levels of m6A. Moreover, we and others have reported that m6A regulates HIV-1 replication and we have recently extended this work by showing that m6A also enhances the replication and pathogenicity of influenza A virus (IAV). A second epitranscriptomic modification, the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine (?), previously thought to be confined to non-coding RNAs, has recently been shown to be almost as prevalent on cellular mRNAs as m6A and we have now observed that the genomic RNAs (gRNAs) packaged into virions of the retrovirus murine leukemia virus display a range of epitranscriptomic modifications, including not only m6A and ? but also 5-methylcytosine (5mC) residues. In this grant application, we propose to use ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to systematically identify and quantitate the epitranscriptomic modifications that are present on highly purified gRNAs isolated from HIV-1 virions. We will then map the precise locations of three of the most prevalent epitranscriptomic modifications on both the gRNA and on HIV-1 mRNAs expressed in CD4+ T-cells and myeloid cells. Next, we will seek to silently mutate these modified sites in the context of an infectious HIV-1 provirus and determine whether, and how, these modifications affect viral gene expression and replication. We will also seek to identify the cellular factors that deposit these epitranscriptomic marks on HIV-1 transcripts and we will then test the effect of loss of expression, or overexpression, of these factors on HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T cells. Finally, we will analyze the effect of environmental stresses, such as heat shock and treatment with drugs of abuse, specifically nicotine and morphine, on the level of epitranscriptomic modification of cellular and viral transcripts expressed in HIV-1 infected cells. In parallel, we will also determine whether these same treatments affect the level of expression of the cellular factors that add or remove epitranscriptomic marks. Together, this research is designed to determine how epitranscriptomic gene regulation modulates HIV-1 replication and begin to shed light on how environmental factors, including drugs of abuse, can affect this process."
"9529927","PROJECT SUMMARY Skeletal muscle contractile function, as characterized by its ability to generate force, is an important determinant of functional independence, chronic disease risk and mortality. Thus, understanding the regulation of muscle force generation is important for the development of strategies to optimize muscle function and quality of life. The long-term objective of this research is to elucidate the new mechanisms that regulate skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling, contractile function and, ultimately, its capacity to generate force. In cardiac muscle, phosphorylation-based signaling of contractile proteins is an important regulator of force output. In skeletal muscle, however, its overall contribution to function is minimal, with hitherto unknown modes of regulation proposed as being critical. The fundamental premise of this application is that lysine acetylation of contraction-related proteins is necessary for the ability of skeletal muscle to produce force. Accordingly, in this application our primary objective is to elucidate the importance of the acetyltransferases (KATs), p300 (E1A binding protein p300) and CBP (cAMP response element-binding protein binding protein), to skeletal muscle force generating capacity, and to identify the impact of contraction on the acetylation of contraction-associated proteins, and determine whether that are regulated by p300 and CBP. Our central hypothesis is that acetylation of contraction-related proteins by p300 or CBP (due to functional redundancy) is required for skeletal muscle force generation. To address our hypothesis, we will measure skeletal muscle contractile function in novel mouse models in which p300 and CBP KAT activity is temporally and specifically manipulated in skeletal muscle. Moreover, we will use pharmacological inhibitors of p300/CBP to distinguish the acute and `direct' effects of p300 and CBP on the acetylation of proteins central to muscle function, from the `indirect' effects that occur via regulation of gene transcription. Specifically, Aim #1 will investigate the acute and chronic contributions of p300 and CBP to skeletal muscle force generating capacity, whilst Aim #2 will define the contraction- and p300/CBP-dependent acetylome and phosphoproteome in skeletal muscle. Altogether, these studies will provide insight into the contribution of p300, CBP and acetylation to skeletal muscle contractile function, which we expect will foster the development of novel therapies to improve the force generating capacity of skeletal muscle. Ultimately, the impact to human health would be improvements in functional independence and quality of life for individuals afflicted by disease(s) that impinge muscle function."
"9482400","Project Summary  The proposed randomized, controlled trial will evaluate the effects of an intervention to reduce exposure to medications among hospitalized older adults discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). This study will be conducted in one university-affiliated hospital and 14 area SNFs to enroll approximately 1,300 total participants across five project years. Patients discharged to SNF represent the largest segment of Medicare beneficiaries discharged to post-acute care services and are a particularly high risk group for loss of independence and other poor clinical outcomes. This investigative team recently completed a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Innovation Award, which provides strong preliminary data related to the prevalence of polypharmacy and the relationship between polypharmacy and geriatric syndromes (e.g., medications associated with falls) in this patient population. Based on these data, we developed a structured deprescribing intervention protocol (?Shed-Meds?) coupled with standardized screening assessments for eight geriatric syndromes to be implemented in the hospital and continued during the SNF stay. The goal of the intervention is to safely deprescribe medications, as defined by dose reductions and stopped medications, based on a combination of clinical criteria and patient preferences. We have pilot-tested our patient-centered intervention in preparation for this proposal with promising results. The proposed trial will evaluate the effects of this intervention on medication exposure, medication adherence, geriatric syndromes, and health status across the care transitions from hospital to SNF to home to include a 90-day follow-up period after SNF discharge. Our overarching hypothesis is that reducing medications for older patients across the continuum of care will favorably impact geriatric syndromes."
"9632885","PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias are a major public health burden and disproportionately affect African Americans. The mechanisms underlying this disparity are not well-understood, but elevated blood pressure could be key. Compared with whites, African Americans have higher prevalence, earlier age of onset, and greater severity of hypertension. Thus, older African Americans tend to have greater cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure throughout adulthood than older whites. No prior research, however, has quantified the contribution of hypertension to racial disparities in Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias. There are significant methodological challenges to addressing this important question, including (1) measurement of cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure from the age of onset of hypertension through late adulthood, (2) measurement of cognitive function in diverse populations, and (3) possible survival bias, which is likely to differentially affect African Americans. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify the extent to which elevated blood pressure from mid- through late- adulthood mediates racial disparities in Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias. This project uses an innovative approach to examine this important question with existing data from two diverse Northern California cohorts: the University of California, Davis Aging Diversity Cohort and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Multiphasic Health Checkup cohort, which links mid-adulthood physical examinations with long-term medical record information. Analyses will address the three major methodologic challenges outlined above by examining cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure as measured at multiple points in adulthood, developing a novel neuroimaging-based brain health index in a diverse population, and quantifying the potential magnitude of survival bias using comprehensive midlife data to account for differential survival. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant?s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) measuring and modeling cognitive function in diverse populations, (2) clinical assessment and diagnosis of Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias, (3) assessing brain health with neuroimaging, and (4) the biology of vascular disease relevant to Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias. The combined research and training plans will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career focused on identifying modifiable determinants of Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias in diverse populations. The methodological challenges addressed in this project are common to many areas of research on disparities in aging and cumulative exposure to risk factors throughout the lifecourse for Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias."
"9581524","Project Summary  Borrelia burgdorferi is an obligate parasite, and is maintained in nature through a complex cycle involving both a tick and mammalian host. The transition between these two very different host types requires the ability to rapidly adapt through changes in gene expression. Previous studies have provided information on a number of genes that may be differentially expressed under conditions intended to mimic that of the vertebrate or arthropod host. Despite these advances, there remains a fundamental gap in our understanding of the role and function of many genes for host adaptation. Our long-term goals are to identify and characterize the proteins necessary for adaptation of B. burgdorferi to both the tick and mammalian host environments. The overall objective of this application is to identify B. burgdorferi candidate genes required for adapting specifically to the arthropod host. Based on cited studies and preliminary data, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that many B. burgdorferi genes of unknown function are adaptively expressed during uptake and colonization of the tick vector. Furthermore, we hypothesize that some genes important for host adaptation are either transiently expressed, or are induced only during late-stage infection of ticks. The rationale for the proposed research is that once the genes involved in adapting to the tick environment have been identified, it will be possible to determine their respective roles in establishing arthropod infection. This has the potential for important breakthroughs in the field of B. burgdorferi adaptive gene expression that will ultimately lead to strategies to disrupt the enzootic life cycle of the Lyme disease pathogen. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to that part of NIH?s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will potentially help to reduce the burdens of human illness and disability. Guided by cited work and preliminary data, our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Identify genes involved in the adaptation of B. burgdorferi to the arthropod vector environment; and 2) Identify transiently expressed host adaptation factors of B. burgdorferi important for tick infection. Under the first aim, we will make use of In Vivo Expression Technology (IVET). This system will utilize a promoter-based genomic DNA library of B. burgdorferi that is designed to allow for the selection of only those promoters that are active exclusively within the tick host. The second aim will utilize a modified version of the IVET system, termed Recombinase-based IVET (RIVET). This system will also make use of a promoter-based genomic DNA library of B. burgdorferi designed to allow identification of genes important for infection at specific stages of the tick life cycle. When applied, the results from the proposed studies are expected to ultimately lead to new control measures to disrupt the pathogen?s enzootic cycle and prevent infection by the Lyme disease spirochete."
"9599176","Abstract A person, usually a child, dies of rabies every nine minutes globally. Current rabies virus (RABV) post- exposure prophylaxis (PEP) remains complicated and costly, requiring four to five doses of inactivated RABV-based plus rabies immune globulin (RIG) to stunt the virus while vaccine-induced antibodies are forming. A single-dose vaccine that does not require expensive RIG would enhance the efficacy of RABV vaccination, reduce the cost associated with rabies prevention, and save lives. For the last 35 years, B cells secreting IgG (but not IgM) were thought to be solely responsible for vaccine-induced protection against RABV infection via T cell-dependent (TD) responses in PEP settings. However, we showed that vaccine- induced T cell-independent (TI) and early extrafollicular TD B cell responses, including neutralizing IgM, can limit dissemination of pathogenic RABV into the CNS, partially protecting mice. We also showed that ?free? RABV particles migrate to subcapsular sinus macrophages in the draining lymph node, transferring RABV antigen directly to B cells. Finally, we showed that displaying membrane-anchored molecular adjuvants on the surface of the RABV particle enhances the kinetics and magnitude of the early B cell response compared with RABV particles not displaying the molecular adjuvant. We aim to exploit our findings by developing novel RABV-based virus like particles (VLPs). Specifically, we hypothesize that the highly ordered and repetitive display of proteins on the surface of RABV-based VLPs will provide an excellent scaffold to display antigen (RABV glycoprotein) and a membrane-anchored molecular adjuvant directly to B cells. The extensive cross-linking of RABV-based VLPs to activating receptors on antigen-specific B cells will result in B cells rapidly differentiating into IgM and IgG plasma cells, enhancing the kinetics and magnitude of RABV-specific humoral immunity. In this proposal, we will construct two RABV-based VLPs and then determine the relative potency of each. The VLP with the highest relative potency will be selected as the backbone to insert virus membrane-anchored molecular adjuvants. Next, the new VLPs will be tested in well-described mouse models of rabies immunogenicity and post-exposure protection. The milestone for this project is the identification of a safe RABV-based VLP that induces potent and rapid TI and extrafollicular TD B cell responses more effectively than the multi-dose human rabies vaccine, without the need for RIG, for future investigation. This project also addresses mechanisms important for other antibody-based vaccines under development: i.e., how can viral vaccines target B cell to induce rapid, potent and long-lasting B cell responses using only a single, low-dose of a VLP-based vaccine? In summary, single-dose vaccine strategies capable of eliciting rapid and robust B cell responses will improve the efficacy of human rabies vaccines, reduce the cost associated with rabies prevention and save lives."
"9416704","PROJECT SUMMARY Endothelium lines blood vessels and interconnects all organ systems. However, endothelial cells exhibit a rich diversity in structure and function. Such heterogeneity is apparent between endothelial cells in different organs, in endothelial cells along a single vascular segment within an organ, and between immediately adjacent cells. This program project grant is founded on the overall hypothesis that endothelium lining pulmonary arteries, capillaries, and veins is phenotypically distinct, where each cell type is specialized to fulfill the unique demands of its vascular niche. Specialization among these cells is encoded by discrete organization of second messenger signaling networks. Therefore, in this competitive renewal each of our projects examines the organization and function of endothelial cell signaling networks. We evaluate the origin of second messenger signals, how these signals spread inside of the cell, what limits the lifespan of the signals, and which effector proteins are principally activated by the signals. For the first time we can measure three-dimensional spread of second messengers in realistic cellular geometries over time. Bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa impair endothelial cell function during the course of infection that culminates in acute lung injury. P. aeruginosa alters the organization and function of second messenger signaling, and in some instances, the bacterium utilizes enzymes that generate second messenger signals during the host- pathogen interaction. P. aeruginosa and its exoenzymes disrupt the endothelial cell barrier, and hence, our projects use this bacterium and its toxins to probe determinants of endothelial heterogeneity and function, including barrier integrity. All projects take advantage of vertically integrated approaches, ranging from the use of cultured cells (e.g. with control for substrate stiffness) to various in situ (e.g. isolated organs, lung slices, isolated blood vessels, and cell-free lung scaffolds) and in vivo preparations. In each of these cases, attention is paid to what is similar, and what is dissimilar, about the respective cell phenotypes. Altogether, projects systematically address three specific aims or objectives, to: (1) identify and test novel molecular mechanisms (e.g. signatures) that are responsible for site-specific endothelial cell function, especially in the microcirculation, (2) determine the importance of these mechanisms in preclinical models of disease, and (3) translate novel therapeutic approaches to preclinical models of disease. Projects are highly interactive. Defining mechanisms that underlie second messenger signaling networks will not only inform us as to the nature of endothelial cell heterogeneity, but provide unprecedented insight into host-pathogen interactions that disrupt the endothelial cell barrier and cause tissue edema. Mechanistic insight into endothelial signal transduction networks will reveal novel therapeutic approaches to improve endothelial dysfunction."

"9519221","Carrying the APOE ?4 gene allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). In contrast, APOE ?2 gene allele protects against AD. Consequently, identifying the mechanisms by which APOE alleles alter AD risk is very important to public health. The overall goal of this research is to identify the critical mechanisms that distinguish APOE ?2 from APOE ?4 in order to develop interventions that prevent or ameliorate AD risk by mimicking favorable differential effects of the APOE ?2 variant. The objective of this particular project is to test whether brain apoE lipidation differentiates APOE ?2 from APOE ?4 variant. We are interested in how ApoE HDL in the brain regulates the metabolism of the omega-3 (?-3) polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We recently demonstrated that in patients with mild AD, APOE ?2 carriers have greater cerebrospinal to plasma DHA ratio compared with APOE ?4 carriers. After 18 months of DHA supplementation, APOE ?4 carriers had less delivery of DHA to the brain compared with non-carriers. Using [11C]-DHA PET, we demonstrated that younger APOE4 carriers have a deficit in brain DHA compared with non-carriers. We hypothesize that reduced ApoE4 lipidation underlies the changes in DHA brain delivery in the context of APOE ?4 genotype. To test our hypothesis, we propose in Aim 1 mechanistic studies to identify DHA transport by ApoE HDL both in vivo and in vitro. Using the apoE mimetic peptide CS-6253, we will test whether enhancing the lipidation of apoE4 proteins would enhance the delivery of DHA to the brain in APOE4 mice. In Aim 2, we develop a novel PET imaging technique for assessing [18F]-DHA brain uptake. We assembled an outstanding group of scientists with expertise in neurochemistry, brain imaging and lipid metabolism to complete our study goals. Our project will identify apoE lipidation as a potential therapeutic target for interventions that prevent or ameliorate AD risk by mimicking favorable lipid carrying effects of the APOE ?2 variant."
"9541945","Project Summary Pseudomonas aeruginosa is among the most common causes of blinding corneal disease, while also being a major cause of life threating nosocomial infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and cytstic fibrosis (CF), targeting immunocompromised and critically injured patients. Publications from the Fleiszig lab have shown that twitching motility, a type of surface associated movement, contributes to the ability of P. aeruginosa to penetrate human corneal epithelial cell multilayers in vitro and is critical to pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa corneal infection in a mouse model in vivo. Key to P. aeruginosa pathogenesis in the cornea is the capacity of the bacteria to invade corneal epithelial cells. While P. aeruginosa mutants that lack twitching motility can invade epithelial cells, and replicate inside them just as efficiently as wildtype bacteria, they have reduced capacity for exiting cells they have entered. During my postdoctoral fellowship in the Fleiszig lab, I used imaging and various other methods to study the mechanisms by which P. aeruginosa exits epithelial cells. Importantly, my preliminary data show that exit does not necessarily follow cell death, suggesting active/deliberate mechanisms contribute. My data further show that when twitching mutants invade and replicate in corneal epithelial cells, they differ from wildtype P. aeruginosa in being unable to distribute themselves in the cytoplasm and instead accumulate in aggregates. I have also screened a mutant library for exit capacity, and have found that mutants in either of two phospholipases, PlcB or PA2155, are exit defective. In contrast to twitching mutants, the phospholipase mutants spread normally throughout the host cell cytoplasm. Thus, my data mechanistically separate the exit process into two stages one dependent on twitching and the other dependent on phospholipases. My theoretical model for exit is that P. aeruginosa uses twitching motility to avoid forming a biofilm aggregate inside the cell and to access the host cell plasma membrane, where they use phospholipase activity (e.g. of PlcB and PA2155) to alter the plasma membrane to provide an exit route. Thus, in aim 1 I will the identify the genes transcripts that impact twitching mutant aggregation and exit compared to wildtype, and in aim 2 I will determine if phospholipases facilitate exit through their enzymatic activity. While contributing to our understanding of P. aeruginosa pathogenesis, this project could ultimately contribute to development of strategies for preventing and treating infections that act by preventing bacterial penetration through our protective surface epithelia."
"9478035","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic regulation is a fundamental mechanism that bridges the genome with the environment, and is emerging as a key determinant of longevity. Recent findings in C. elegans have provided strong evidence that epigenetic mechanisms, in particular chromatin regulation, are intimately involved in longevity determination and its inheritance. Despite the exciting biological data, the mechanisms of how epigenetic regulation influences longevity are unclear. The long-term goal of this application is to elucidate how epigenetic regulation bridges the genome and the environment to modulate longevity. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that we can gain mechanistic insights into the connection of epigenetic regulation and longevity by studying longevity mutants with disrupted epigenetic mechanisms and by probing how the overall epigenetic landscape changes with age in the powerful model C. elegans. Building on recent discoveries in my lab, we will pursue three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate the mechanisms by which the putative H3K9me3 methyltransferases SET-9 & SET-26 limit lifespan and maintain germline immortality. We propose to determine the longevity pathways they act in, identify the protein domains and the tissue specificity key to their action, and map their genome-wide binding profiles and transcriptional outputs. The proposed investigations will reveal how SET-9/26 influence longevity and transgenerational inheritance. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of H3K36me3 in age-dependent gene regulation and longevity. We propose to examine whether altered RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription contributes to age-dependent gene expression changes, identify the factors that recognize the H3K36me3 mark, and monitor the biological consequence of depleting H3K36 methylation in specific cells/tissues. H3K36me3 is a ubiquitous histone modification, thus elucidating its mechanism in gene expression regulation through the aging process will provide important new insights into not only aging biology but also fundamental mechanisms of gene regulation. In Aim 3, we will investigate how the chromatin landscape changes with age. Currently not much is known about how aging impacts the general chromatin landscape in C. elegans. We propose to profile the genome-wide patterns of several key histone modifications, as well as nucleosome density, through the aging process, and use computational methods to uncover age-dependent patterns that can generate testable hypotheses for future studies. Findings from our proposed investigations will provide a much-needed framework for integrating emerging functional data to understand how the epigenome modulates aging and longevity in C. elegans. The data generated in this aim will also be a useful resource for the aging and gene regulation research community. The proposed research will provide substantial new insights into how epigenetic mechanisms influence aging and longevity in the key model organism C. elegans, and will more broadly impact the understanding of the epigenetic basis of longevity in diverse organisms."
"9465745","Project Summary / Abstract  The objective of this STTR Phase II proposal is to utilize our proof-of concept results to develop and market an easy-to-use standardized platform to quantify genotoxicity specifically in basal cell skin  keratinocytes from organotypic cultures (EpidermTM; MatTek) in response to commonly used chemical  agents. The product is an automated high-throughput Immuno-CometChip assay that simultaneously  isolates and verifies the basal layer origin of cells derived from an organotypic reconstructed human epidermis, and quantifies their level of DNA damage. The impact of the research will be to reduce  animal model use for toxic agent screening, since human organotypic culture has been shown to be  almost identical to human skin with respect to its response to corrosive, irritating, and allergic agents.  The market for screening skin genotoxic agents is large, and current screening procedures cannot keep  pace with new agents currently being introduced. Many of these agents are screened by companies,  who will have an interest in a rapid method to determine at an early stage whether or not to proceed with  research and development of lead compounds. We therefore propose the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To develop control cells to be included with each run of the Immuno-Comet Chip assay  to ensure that our new method for the isolation of basal keratinocytes using a  collagen I/agarose composite gel for our new CometChip platform (see below), will  be successful for each run following an immunostaining method for simultaneous  visualization of ?1 integrin along with DNA damage. Specific Aim 2: To develop computer software that only measures comets in integrin ?1-postive basal cells. Specific Aim 3: To determine activity of human epidermal cytochrome p450s (CYP) in the EpiDermTM  organotypic model, in order to test if preincubation of procarcinogens and human  S9 fractions is necessary. Specific Aim 4: To test 10 compounds each of carcinogens, procarcinogens and non-carcinogens  from ?Toxicology in the 21st Century?

"9518486","Current therapy of the ichthyoses, including the lipid synthetic, autosomal recessive congenital ichthyoses (ARCI), is largely symptomatic, and often irrational; e.g., when removal of excess scale interferes with homeostatic responses that allow patients to survive in a harsh, terrestrial environment. At the other extreme, corrective gene therapy, though seductive in concept, remains a distant dream, with many potential pitfalls. Our proposed new approach has been first, to identify pathogenic mechanisms in ARCI patients, using biopsies from patients and animal models, as well as organotypic models (HEEs) of the ARCI, prepared from either patient fibroblast or keratinocyte cell lines, or from normal fibroblasts by CRISPR/Cas 9 technology. Using ultrastructural, lipid biochemical, and RNA-seq technology, we will assess both the cellular and genetic basis for these disorders, and identify compensatory mechanisms that account for patient survival. We then will assess whether this new information can translate into readily-deployable, topical therapies for patients after their initial optimization in ARCI HEEs, and in disease-appropriate animal models. Following identification and optimization of effective therapy in the animal models, we will initiate clinical studies for these patients, supported by a parallel grant proposal. If successful, this approach should initiate a paradigm shift in how many of the ichthyoses will be treated in the future. Finally, since the cutaneous phenotype reflects pathogenic mechanisms that also are on-going in syndromic disorders with extracutaneous disease manifestations, successful pathogenesis-based therapy for these ARCI could also identify comparable approaches to treat/prevent the extracutaneous manifestations of these disorders."
"9250672","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: When older adults are hospitalized, they are often discharged on substantially different medication regimens than the ones they were using prior to admission. In this setting, errors of medication reconciliation and problems with medication adherence are common. To address these problems, much effort has focused on improving medication reconciliation and communication at the time of discharge. However, little attention has been paid to the medication changes themselves that happen during the hospital stay. These changes are often inappropriate, and can lead to medication confusion, non-adherence, and adverse drug reactions in the weeks and months after hospital discharge. This is particularly important for chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, as medicines for these conditions may often be changed during the hospital stay and perpetuated at discharge despite having little relation to the reason for admission. Aims: (1) To determine the frequency and epidemiology of changes to medication regimens for hypertension and diabetes in older adults admitted to VA hospitals; (2) To evaluate the impact of these medication changes on medication persistence and adherence in the year after discharge; and (3) To evaluate the association between changes to chronic medications during the hospital stay and subsequent emergency department visits and hospital readmissions. Methods: Using national data from VA and Medicare, we will assemble a retrospective cohort of veterans age 65 years and older who had hypertension or diabetes and were hospitalized in a VA medical center with community-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or venous thromboembolism. (These conditions were chosen because they are common and are treated with a different set of medications than those used to manage hypertension and diabetes). Using claims data and targeted chart review, we will identify 500 patients who were discharged on more aggressive regimens for blood pressure and/or glycemic control than they were receiving prior to admission, and a control group of 500 patients without intensified regimens. We will use standard methods to evaluate persistence of and adherence to medications in the year after hospital discharge. We will use Cox regression and mixed effects generalized linear models to compare medication persistence and adherence in patients who were discharged from the hospital with a more intensive medication regimen vs. patients whose medication regimens were not intensified. We will use similar methods to determine the impact of medication changes during hospitalization on subsequent emergency department use and hospital readmission."
"9474622","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to develop a new paradigm for targeting the HIV-1 envelope in order to inactivate the virus specifically, and before host cell encounter. The uniquely HIV-1-specific envelope spike protein, comprised of the trimeric complex of gp120 and gp41 heterodimers embedded in the virus membrane, is the only virus-specific protein exposed on the outside of the virion particle and thus is an attractive targt for neutralizing the virus. HIV-1 inactivation by targeting the Env protein could prevent initial infection, and suppress virus spread in already-infected individuals. Recently, we reported the discovery of a molecule termed CVN-DAVEI that selectively induced destructive lysis of both fully infectious BaL HIV-1 and pseudotyped virus. Our vision is that CVN-DAVEI takes advantage of the inherent metastability of the Env complex to destroy the virus, and that this metastability is an Achilles' heel against which a new class of HIV- inactivating hunter-killer molecules can be designed. While the HIV-1 inactivation phenotype is enticing, our understanding of the structural mechanism of DAVEI function is incomplete. In this proposal, we will determine this mechanism and use the resulting mechanistic underpinning to move towards smaller and more clinically relevant HIV-1 inactivator lead compounds. Our project team will embody the required protein science, molecular design, chemical synthesis and computational structure analysis expertise to accomplish these overarching goals. Three interconnected Specific Aims are proposed. Aim 1. Determine the mechanism of the DAVEI MPER domain in the lytic inactivation of HIV-1. Aim 2. Determine the mechanism of Env glycan engagement by the DAVEI lectin domain and the stoichiometry of DAVEI:Env spike encounter. Aim 3. Define the roles of Env structure and conformational plasticity in the lytic inactivation of HIV-1 by DAVEI via the design of novel DAVEI fusion constructs. Overall, this work will define the minimum requirements for virolytic function by dual-binding molecules. In turn, the results will expand our understanding on how the virus metastability, that is a requirement for HIV-1 cell infection, can be exploited for DAVEI-induced HIV-1 lysis. The project will yield hunter-killer lead compounds that will open up new molecular design strategies for preventing transmission and battling infection. Finally, the virolysis activity engineered into these anti-HIV constructs wll provide precedent to design molecules to combat other metastable enveloped viruses, such as influenza, Ebola, and dengue."
"9449379","Calorie restriction (CR) was shown to extend longevity in many organisms; however, the mechanisms of CR are still mostly unknown. In our previous study we found that the circadian clock is an important component of CR mechanisms in mammals. We established that CR regulates expression of the circadian clock genes by controlling activity of circadian transcriptional regulators BMAL1 and CRY1. In agreement with that, BMAL1 is necessary for the full metabolic benefits of CR including lifespan extension. Indeed, we found that BMAL1 negatively regulates activity of mTORC1, which is implicated in the regulation of aging and CR-mediated increase in longevity. We will continue the study by exploring our hypothesis that circadian clock recruitment is essential for resource allocation and the full beneficial effects of CR on physiology; in particular, CR recruits the circadian clocks by regulating the level and activity of CRY1 and BMAL1 proteins, which in turn contributes to differential regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2. We will explore the hypothesis through three specific aims. Aim 1. To decipher the mechanisms of regulation of the circadian clock gene expression by CR. Aim 2. To investigate circadian clock-mediated mechanisms of CR-imposed effects on mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity and signaling. Aim 3. To dissect the effects of periodic feeding with or without reduced calorie intake on CR- induced metabolic changes and longevity."

CKD-PC was formed in 2009 and now includes data on >11 million participants from more than 70 cohorts spanning 40 countries with a strong track record of producing high impact meta-analyses (2 in NEJM, 3 in Lancet, 4 in JAMA, 1 in BMJ, 4 in Kidney Int, 2 in JASN, 2 in AJKD, and 1 in Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol). CKD-PC complements established cohorts in CKD by representing a broad range of global populations; spanning the full range of kidney function; devoting tenacious attention to harmonization, exploration of heterogeneity, and calibration; and meta-analyzing results where appropriate.  In this new funding period, we will continue to mentor and recruit investigators and cohorts from around the world, grow substantially, and innovate with new areas of emphasis in the following aims: Aim 1. To determine risk of incident CKD and CKD progression associated with clinical markers across a range of patient populations. Aim 2. To evaluate the risk of non-kidney outcomes associated with eGFR and albuminuria. Aim 3. To develop risk calculators for CKD incidence, CKD progression, and ESRD overall and in specific populations such as patients with heart failure.  In all aims, we will continue to implement and expand upon our innovative meta-analysis methods, including Markov processes, simulations, and standard incorporation of competing risks. We remain flexible and efficient in responding to high priority topics set forth by guideline organizations (e.g., Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes), regulatory agencies (e.g., US Food and Drug Administration) and major societies (e.g., International Society of Nephrology, National Kidney Foundation, and American Society of Nephrology) as well as informing global health metrics and economic efforts (e.g., Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Global Burden of Disease). Our overarching goal is to advance the understanding, care, and outcomes of CKD patients and global populations, using an investigator-led global consortium and the data and expertise from ~300 international collaborators."
"9483578","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental connection between metabolism, aging, and neural functions. Considering that the nervous system centrally coordinates organismal metabolism and therefore its sequale, understanding the precise mechanisms through which the nervous system assesses organismal energetic state is fundamental to understanding aging and age on-set diseases.  Changes in flux through the tryptophan degradation pathway, also known as the kynurenine pathway, have been linked to a variety of neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as well as psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. Blocking the tryptophan degradation pathway at various points ameliorates murine, Drosophila, and C. elegans models of neurodegeneration or protein aggregation. How one amino acid degradation pathway affects such a broad range of neurological processes remains a mystery. In the course of studying C. elegans feeding regulatory pathways, we made the unexpected discovery that a specific kynurenine pathway metabolite, kynurenic acid, is locally produced within the animal's nervous system and serves as an endogenous measure of food availability. Our preliminary genetic and biochemical studies connect this metabolite through a glutamatergic signaling pathway to serotonin release, which in turn, modulates neuroendocrine secretions including that of insulin. This is accomplished through serotonergic inhibition of AMP-activated kinase in specific neurons. As tryptophan is an essential amino acid and various tryptophan- derived metabolites have neural signaling properties, I hypothesize that the kynurenine pathway metabolites are an ancient mechanism that links metabolism to neural functions including neuroendocrine secretions that coordinate the intertwined pathways of metabolism, protein homeostasis, and aging.  I propose to use C. elegans to delineate the molecular circuits that link kynurenic acid levels to neuroendocrine mechanisms of aging and protein homeostasis. We will first establish the precise molecular links between kynurenic acid and insulin secretion from specific neurons, investigate the consequences of this neural pathway on organism-wide mechanisms of proteostasis, and define the regulatory relationships between the kynurenine pathway and various longevity mutants. Together, these studies will be a paradigm for how metabolism is sensed by the nervous system to regulate age related processes."
"9476320","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) hold great promise in regenerative medicine for the treatment of chronic or currently incurable cardiovascular diseases. The homing of EPCs to neovascular areas requires a coordinated sequence of multistep events, including chemoattraction, adhesion, and invasion, before differentiation into mature endothelial cells and incorporation into active neovasculature. Impaired EPC function in mobilization and homing affects vascular homeostasis and also compensatory angiogenesis. Circulating EPCs may thus provide an endogenous repair mechanism to counteract ongoing risk factor-induced endothelial injury and to replace dysfunctional endothelium. Members of the SMYD protein family represent an emerging group of lysine methyltransferases that are particularly abundant in the cytoplasm, with SMYD1 being most highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscles. SMYD1 knockout in mice results in early embryonic lethality due to disruption of cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis. It has been reported that the chemokine receptor CXCR2 and its cognate ligands mediate EPC recruitment and angiogenesis in endothelial injury and myocardial ischemia. Compared with what is known about CXCR2 phosphorylation and other posttranslational modifications (such as ubiquitination and glycosylation), nothing is known about the lysine methylation of CXCR2, and how CXCR2 methylation might influence CXCR2 activation and signaling, especially as involved in EPC biology. The long-term goal is to better understand the molecular mechanisms regulating EPC homing and angiogenesis, in the hope of revealing novel therapeutic targets for certain vascular diseases. The hypothesis of this application is that lysine methylation of CXCR2 by the histone methyltransferase SMYD1 regulates EPC homing and angiogenesis through modulating CXCR2 activation and signaling. The specific aims of this project are: first, to examine the effect of SMYD1 in modulating CXCR2- mediated EPC migratory and angiogenic activities; and second, to characterize the molecular mechanism by which SMYD1 regulates CXCR2-mediated EPC function. A combination of multiple approaches, i.e., molecular and biochemical techniques, cellular functional assays, and in vivo animal models, will be used to test the hypothesis. The proposed research is innovative because by exploring a previously unrecognized lysine methylation of CXCR2 in modulating EPC functions, new potential therapeutic paradigms may evolve for EPC- based cell therapy in aberrant angiogenesis. In addition, this is the first study to investigate methylation of CXCR2 that may be the first non-histone target/substrate of the histone lysine methyltransferase SMYD1. The anticipated results from this proposal are the identification of a yet-unexplored role of the lysine methyltransferase SMYD1 in regulating CXCR2 function and the establishment of a novel link between lysine methylation, chemokine receptor activation, and endothelial signaling during vascular development and injury. Such results are expected to have an important impact in EPC biology, because the mechanistic characterization of the SMYD1-catalyzed CXCR2 lysine methylation are likely to provide valuable information for enhancing EPC-based cell therapy for certain vascular diseases, as well as to fundamentally advance the field of chemokine receptor biology."
"9531223","SUMMARY Detecting the first and earliest stages of cognitive decline, conceptualized as ?mild cognitive impairment? (MCI), has become increasingly important in recent years, as research focuses on delaying the manifestations of more severe stages of decline. It is now well recognized that changes in performance on cognitive tests begin up to ten years (or longer) before clinically apparent symptoms of dementia or functional impairment appear. Conventional assessment methods for assessing cognition Conventional assessment methods typically use the spoken response modality in which subjects are asked to verbally respond to prompts, and examiners carefully listen to these responses and apply test manuals to compute scores. These assessment methods require trained specialists and can be burdensome because they need to performed in clinics, especially so with frequent reassessment. Automating the scoring of assessment is important, not only for alleviating this burden but also for enabling large-scale studies on new intervention methods. Our research goal is to automate detection of MCI by developing, applying, and evaluating a system for automation of verbal (i.e., using spoken responses) cognitive-test scoring. Focusing on four verbal cognitive tests, we develop an extensible system comprising ASR and machine-learning algorithms to automatically score responses, and measure the efficacy of our proposed method by validating the accuracy of the automatically obtained scores against gold-standard, clinically obtained scores (Aim 1). Next, we develop classification methods for detecting individuals with MCI based on all information available in the verbal responses, and validating this classification against gold-standard clinical consensus."
"9675656","Alteration and Remediation of Asbestos Fibers: Current state-of-the-art for treatment of asbestos-  contaminated sites is to move the asbestos and/or cap the site. The proposed research examines whether  chemical alteration of asbestos particles by plants and/or fungi, either directly or indirectly via plant exudates or  fungal metabolites, may be useful for bioremediation of asbestos-contaminated sites. The project is motivated  by evidence that fungi (Fusarium oxysporum and Verticillium leptobactrum) can remove Fe atoms from  asbestos particles, rendering them less toxic. We will target plant species that are known to be metal hyper-  accumulators or are native to soils naturally high in heavy metals, such as serpentine soils, and whose roots  form mutualist relationships with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We hypothesize that: it is possible to  discover and quantify new ways to remediate asbestos sites in situ using a combination of hyper-  accumulating plants and plants native to serpentine soils coupled with their associated arbuscular  mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We propose to test this hypothesis using three specific strategies: 1) Determine  new ways to remediate asbestos piles using iron hyper-accumulating plants, plants native to serpentine soils  with AMF associations, and the exudates and metabolites fundamentally responsible for the chemical and  physical alteration, 2) Validate the effect, rate and chemical mechanisms of asbestos fiber remediation by  chemical analysis and spectroscopy techniques and to produce remediated fibers in suspension to apply to  cells in Project 4, and to test directly, in animal model systems, whether remediation of asbestos abrogates its  carcinogenic potential in vivo in Project 5, and to determine the size reduction and surface charge change of  remediated fibers, which applies to Projects 2 and 3). We will etermine whether soil microbial constituents at  the Ambler Superfund site and the relative abundance of different AMF species in greenhouse treatments  respond to the presence of asbestos, providing clues to effective agents for bioremediation. Highly controlled  greenhouse experiments coupled with Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy, X-ray Diffraction  characterization and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry will document the efficacy of  different plant species and combinations of mycorrhizal fungal species in removing Fe from asbestos and  destroying the fibrous structure. Where asbestos is altered at the greatest rates, high throughput DNA  sequencing and pyrosequencing will be used to quantity the relative abundance of the different AMF species.  The same technique will be used to determine how the AMF community at the Ambler superfund site responds  to local concentration of asbestos. This information from the site will inform the greenhouse experiments. We  believe that the proposed research will produce new remediation strategies for asbestos at Superfund and  Brownfields sites, and will eventually lead to marketing such a technique for other sites of asbestos  contamination. If clear remediation results in this trial, a larger translation of the results will be pursued through  an application for an NIH Small Business Grant. Our results have direct impact on Project 2 and we will  communicate how our asbestos remediation affects asbestos fiber size, transport and aggregate formation.  We will work closely to confirm reduced toxicity of remediated fibers with the animal model studies in Project  4, and we will be to take advantage of the in vitro asbestos-induced cell injury models developed in Project 5  to compare the activity of untreated and remediated asbestos fibers. We will also interact significantly with the  Administration, Biostatistics and Translation Cores."
"9577628","Project Summary/Abstract Influenza is a highly contagious viral infectious diseases and causes 250,000-500,000 deaths and 3-5 million severe illnesses each year worldwide. Cellular immunity is crucial to eliminate virus-infected cells and promote recovery. Cellular immunity against conserved antigens can also confer protection against drifted influenza viruses. Current influenza vaccines mainly induce neutralizing antibodies against highly variable surface antigens and poorly induces cellular immunity. Adjuvants are promising to enhance influenza vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses. Yet, current adjuvants approved to boost influenza vaccination mainly enhance humoral immune responses with little effects on cellular immunity. This project develops a physical radiofrequency (RF)-based adjuvant (RFA) with potent humoral and cellular adjuvant effects to boost influenza vaccination with minimal local, systemic or long-term side effects. Our preliminary studies identified potent humoral and cellular adjuvants effects of non-invasive RF treatment on several vaccine antigens, such as model antigen ovalbumin, recombinant hemagglutinin, and pandemic 2009 influenza H1N1 vaccine. The humoral RFA effects are comparable and cellular RFA effects are superior to the most potent adjuvant used in influenza vaccines. We hypothesize the novel RFA will significantly boost influenza vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses, resulting in increased protection against vaccine and non-vaccine viral strains. Three specific aims are proposed: To optimize RFA effects and delineate adjuvantation mechanisms (specific aim 1); To explore RFA to boost seasonal and pre-pandemic influenza vaccination (specific aim 2); To develop RFA-based universal T cell vaccine (specific aim 3). Safety and potency of RFA will be first explored in murine models and then validated in miniature pigs. The success of this project will allow us to submit Investigational Device Exemption applications to explore RFA to boost influenza vaccination in clinics. Our ultimate goal is to develop a handheld RF device for convenient and cost-effective adjuvantation of influenza vaccination."
"9539041","ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY: Despite the fact that isolates recovered from fungal infections frequently test as sensitive to antifungal drugs in vitro, chronic fungal infections are notoriously hard to treat. The mechanisms behind this resistance are not well understood, though recent studies of bacterial infections and human tumors are starting to acknowledge that heterogeneity within populations may lead to a misleading assessment of drug susceptibility upon testing only one isolate. This proposal aims to use a unique collection of Candida lusitaniae isolates, obtained from chronic fungal infections in subjects with cystic fibrosis, to learn about naturally-occurring heterogeneity in antifungal resistance that develops even in the absence of antifungal treatment. We found a wide range of heterogeneity in drug resistance phenotypes among isolates from three separate subjects. In-depth analysis of whole genome sequences of twenty isolates from one subject revealed heterogeneity in the sequence of MRR1, which encodes a known antifungal resistance regulator. Analysis of mating progeny and constructed mutants, has shown that MRR1 allele type determines fluconazole susceptibility. This proposal aims to use these isolates to investigate some of the outstanding questions regarding Mrr1-mediated drug resistance, including how MDR1 and other Mrr1-regulated transporters contribute to high levels of fluconazole resistance, as well as resistance to other biologically relevant toxins, like bacterially produced phenazines. In addition to a more mechanistic understanding of fluconazole resistance, this proposal also outlines studies aimed to understand why variance in the MRR1 locus was so strongly selected for. I will utilize these isolates to determine if all Mrr1 variants have increased Mrr1 activity and what this would mean in vivo, which could help identify the host, bacterial or pharmaceutically derived molecule(s) which selected for this variance. These studies will use a variety of mutants in both clinical and lab strains in combination with genetic and molecular analysis to identify key components of the Mrr1-regulon that contribute to fluconazole and phenazine resistance in C. lusitaniae. In addition, these studies will provide insight into how chronically-infecting fungal populations develop MRR1 variation in the absence of antifungal treatment leading to differences in drug resistance among isolates. These studies may prompt a reexamination of the way in which chronic fungal infections are viewed and studied, introducing the need to examine multiple isolates from individuals to accurately assess infecting populations and potentially altering treatment strategies to account for isolates with heterogeneous drug resistance harbored within the population."
"9528129","Project Summary Pneumonic plague is the deadliest form of disease caused by Yersinia pestis. Y. pestis colonizes the lung by suppressing and evading early innate immune responses. This is done in part using a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) to inject mammalian cells with a repertoire of effector proteins aimed at limiting immune cell responsiveness. Traditionally, a mouse model of infection has been used to understand the details of the progression of pneumonic plague. Though important, there are known differences in the roles of key mediators of pathogenesis between murine and human hosts. Further, the inability to extrapolate findings in animal models to human disease is an area of concern, as the failure to translate many biological findings in human trials has placed emphasis on reconsidering the utility of various of animal models. Thus, there is a need to examine infectious disease models in human tissue platforms. In the work proposed here, we seek to employ a donor human lung platform to study early host/pathogen interactions during pneumonic plague. Fully virulent strains of Y. pestis will be used to infect precision-cut human lung slices in order to identify key target cell types, and to evaluate the response of human cells and tissue to Y. pestis infection. The specific aims of the proposal are as follows: Aim 1. Evaluate Y. pestis type III secretion in human lung tissue. In Specific Aim 1, we seek to identify host cell targets of Y. pestis type III secretion in human tissue during infection. To this end, precision-cut human lung slices will be infected with Y. pestis expressing a Yop-?-lactamase hybrid protein, the translocation of which can be identified after incubation of infected cells with the fluorescent ?-lactamase substrate CCF2- AM. Target cells undergoing translocation will be identified and levels of cell death will be quantified. We predict that Y. pestis initially targets a specific population of cells in the lung for the evasion or subversion of host immunity. Importantly, this aim will answer fundamental questions regarding the initial stages of infection by identifying target host cells in a human tissue. Aim 2. Evaluate host response to Y. pestis infection. Though the anti-inflammatory capacity of the Y. pestis Yops is well-established, the host responses to Yop intoxication have not been evaluated in vivo or in the context of pulmonary infection. Importantly, the immediate inflammatory consequences, or lack thereof, have not been evaluated in humans. In specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the immediate inflammatory consequences of Y. pestis pulmonary infection in human precision cut lung slices after infection with wild-type Y. pestis or Y. pestis strains lacking each of the effector Yop proteins. This aim will give crucial insight into how the human host responds to targeting by Y. pestis type III secretion. Importantly, the data we obtain can also be used for comparative analysis to our current murine infection model."
"9585680","PROJECT SUMMARY According to World Health Organization, approximately 1.5 billion people, or 24% of the world?s population, are infected with helminths worldwide. Heavily infected people, particularly children, are nutritionally and physically impaired. Due to rapid reinfection, limited efficacy of current drugs, and a lack of effective vaccines, the eradication of helminth infections remains challenging. There is an urgent need for new preventive medicines and effective anthelminthic drugs. Recent evidence indicates that intestinal epithelial tuft cells can be a direct target and sensor of helminth. Tuft cell-derived interleukin-25 (IL-25) induces type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) cells, which secrete type 2 cytokines such as IL-13 and IL-4 to drive the differentiation and hyperplasia of epithelial tuft and goblet cells. This feedforward response comprised of tuft cells, ILC2, and epithelial progenitors is responsible for the ?weep and sweep? of parasitic worms. Although the regulatory circuit associated with type 2 immunity is beginning to be established, little has been elucidated regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the epithelial remodeling. The research in my laboratory has been focused on the pathophysiological role of O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification, which modifies intracellular proteins at serine and threonine residues. The long-term goal of our research is to understand how protein O- GlcNAcylation orchestrates mucosal responses to pathogens like parasitic helminths. In the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that protein O-GlcNAcylation, by modifying STAT6, is indispensable for tuft cell-initiated intestinal epithelial remodeling and type 2 immune responses to helminth infections. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that OGT promotes the differentiation of tuft and goblet cells from epithelial progenitors, via STAT6 O- GlcNAcylation. By mapping STAT6 O-GlcNAcylation sites and analyzing functions in organoid cultures, we will determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which O-GlcNAcylation controls tuft cell development. In Aim 2, we will use pharmacological and genetic approaches to increase global protein O-GlcNAcylation in the mouse intestine, and test whether the augmentation of intestinal O-GlcNAcylation levels boosts epithelial remodeling and type 2 immune responses to expulse helminths. The proposed study will provide valuable insights into the development of new intervention strategies to eradicate parasitic worms in areas of poverty in the developing world and to treat allergic and autoimmune diseases in industrialized countries."

"9478014","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Therapeutic interventions that target fundamental mechanisms of aging are being sought to radically transform public health. Indicators of biological aging that can be identified prior to overt manifestations of late-life conditions, and concomitantly serve as predictors of future health and longevity, could facilitate this effort. As highlighted in this RFA, resilience, defined as the ability of an organism to adequately respond to physical challenges, may offer one such opportunity. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a battery of disease-agnostic physical challenges to enable the evaluation of resiliency in mice. To this end, in Specific Aim 1 we will determine which physical challenges best reveal differences in resilience between and within younger, middle-aged, and older mice. Specifically, we will assess acute responses to anesthesia, chemotherapy, surgery, and dehydration in cohorts of 4-month-old, 12-month-old, and 20-month-old mice. In Specific Aim 2, using the physical challenges deemed optimal in Specific Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which baseline resilience of middle-aged mice longitudinally predicts healthspan using discriminating measures of physical, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune function at Mayo Clinic, and lifespan at the University of Michigan. Given the considerable evidence that aberrant mTOR signaling and senescent cell accumulation are mediators of aging, in Specific Aim 3 we will determine the extent to which rapamycin and targeted clearance of p16INK4a-positive senescent cells affect the resilience of older mice to physical challenges. We expect that a standardized battery of clinically relevant measures of resilience in laboratory mice will provide a new framework in which to test innovative and potentially transformative interventions to promote healthy aging. In humans, the emergence of chronic diseases and syndromes such as frailty may reflect a point of no return. Compromised resilience earlier in life, on the other hand, may ultimately serve as a therapeutic opportunity in which the progression of aging-related molecular and cellular damage can be attenuated, if not reversed."

"9580820","Project Summary Immunity is an enormously important topic for human health with economic costs of infectious disease eclipsing $100 billion in 2014. At the same time, the evolution of the immune system is fertile ground for the study of evolutionary processes because a) natural selection on immunity is intense since the outcome of infection is often life or death and b) pathogens have the ability to respond to host adaptation leading to rapid evolution through an evolutionary arms race. Since insects lack an adaptive immune system, they are excellent models to understand the molecular genetics and evolution of innate immunity. An important component of innate immunity is the complement of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are produced and secreted by host cells upon infection and directly inhibit pathogens. Variation in the genes encoding these AMPs is often maintained by balancing selection, the process by which multiple alleles are maintained at the same locus through various mechanisms. While instances of balancing selection are being reported more and more frequently, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic basis of balancing selection in most examples. The ability to connect broad scale patterns of DNA sequence diversity to mechanistic differences in protein function is innovative and would provide a comprehensive view of balancing selection. Furthermore, the identification of particular amino acid polymorphisms that are maintained by balancing selection facilitates the mechanistic study of balancing selection because the presumptive causative mutations are known a priori. Our use of Drosophila as a model system also allows for study of AMP variation in vivo in a way that is much more cost effective than several other model systems, while allowing the flexibility to move between in vitro and whole organism in vivo study. These peptides are ideal for the functional study of balancing selection because a) genetic variation in several peptides is maintained by balancing selection, providing replication, b) AMPs are effectors and thus interact directly with pathogens and c) AMPs are small and can be easily studied in vitro. Aim 1 involves determining peptide differences in vitro to understand how single amino acid changes lead to different function. Aim 2 will determine the effect of AMP variation on the entire organism and investigate the role of life history tradeoffs in balancing selection. The project is significant because it will provide a deeper understanding of evolutionary processes by uncovering molecular mechanisms and may provide a better understanding of innate immunity to enhance our treatment of human disease."

"9480663","Abstract This Independent Scientist Award application, in response to PAR-14-045, seeks to extend understanding of the baroreflex (the heart-brain feedback loop) as a malleable physiological mechanism of behavior change. Its significance stems from the central role that physiological reactions to environmental and internal cues play in instigating ?automatic? alcohol use behaviors despite conscious motives to remain abstinent, and the far- reaching public health impact that would arise from optimizing methods to interrupt these ?automatic? behaviors. Its innovation derives from a career development and research plan that bridges AUD treatment- based mechanisms of change research with NIH?s broad science of behavior change platform. Specifically, the proposed, and highly integrated, career development and research components focus on conceptual/analytical training and studies to deconstruct the baroreflex mechanism in terms of its temporal nature (in-the-moment versus across time) and its multi-level influence on biology (heart/brain), cognition (attention), and behavior (alcohol use). The ultimate goal is to bring the scientific evidence for how the baroreflex acts to affect behavior change in line with growing evidence of its clinical utility. The proposed career development activities span three domains: ecological momentary assessment (EMA) analytic strategies, attention theory and tasks, and neuroimaging tools and methodologies, to increase understanding of how behavioral flexibility towards alcohol is managed across cardiovascular and neural systems, and how disruption to the integration of these systems can disrupt attention, leading to a loss of adaptive flexibility and the persistence of AUDs. The first research aim uses EMA strategies to examine the temporal relationship between in-the-moment physiological changes and physiological, psychological and substance use changes that occur daily and weekly during treatment. In doing so, it provides direct insight into changes in baroreflex activation on short time scales and under real world conditions when resonance breathing is used in response to triggers outside the treatment context. The second research aim uses experimental studies to examine the ability of baroreflex activation to alter in-the- moment as well as longer-term (pre- to post-treatment) attentional processing via its influence on neural and cardiac signaling. Thus, it tests whether attention, measured from cognitive test performance as well as physiological and fMRI BOLD reactivity, mediates the influence of baroreflex activation on behavioral control. The research plan is designed as an efficient add-on to R01 AA023667, ?Project IMPACT: In-the-Moment Protect from Automatic Capture by Trigger?, a randomized clinical trial that delivers a baroreflex-based intervention as an adjunct to treatment-as-usual for alcohol and drug use disorders in women with young children (through April 2019). If successful, the proposed research will serve as a springboard for understanding the relation of the baroreflex to cognitive processing, cardiac and neural activity, and to the often unpredictable success of current empirically supported behavioral treatments for AUD."
"9676415","?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapidly growing demand for a new generation of vaporized nicotine products (VNPs) seen in many countries suggests these products are having an impact on cigarette consumption. The specific impact that VNPs are having and how VNPs and tobacco use behaviors are being shaped by public health policies are key questions that need to be answered. The goal of this Program Project is to extend the work of the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project (ITC Project) to characterize the effectiveness of current and potential future policies to regulate VNPs. The timing of this project is opportune since policies regulating VNPs are evolving, and data are needed to help guide policy development. The proposed research is premised on the belief that to thoroughly assess policies regulating VNPs it is essential to do so at both the population level and at the individua-level under controlled experimental conditions. The multi-method approach described will be carried out in three countries - United States (US), England (EN), and Canada (CA)- selected because each have similar smoking rates and histories of cigarette product regulations, but divergent policies regulating VNPs. The proposed set of five inter-related studies and two core services addresses three overall aims: 1) To provide a more thorough understanding of how the policy environment influences uptake of and transitions from smoked tobacco to VNPs. The research team will implement naturalistic studies of broadly representative adult and adolescent samples (Projects 1 & 3) and surveillance of the vaporized nicotine market (Project 2) to allow between country and within-country policy effects to be studied and combining these data with data from experimental studies testing how theoretical policy options might affect the demand for VNPs in nonsmoking youth (Project 3) and adult smokers (Project 4); 2) To contribute to the development of methods for monitoring response to VNPs and future alternative nicotine products. The team will investigate differences in methods in data collection (Projects 1 & 2), study samples (Projects 1, 3 & 4), and experimental protocols (Projects 3 & 4) to see which approaches are most cost-efficient and yield the highest quality data for real-world applications in predicting responses to policy changes; and 3) To develop methods to assist policymakers in forecasting the population health impact of different product regulatory schemes. In Project 5 the group will integrate the data from observational (Projects 1, 2 & 3) and experimental studies (Projects 3 & 4), plus additional data, to model the impact of different policies on population health outcomes. Collectively, the proposed studies comprehensively examine how different VNP policy environments are influencing VNP and smoked tobacco use behaviors in the real world and the measured impact of theoretical policy options in the experimental setting. The end product of this holistic program of policy research will be a unique, multi-country evidence base with strong potential to inform policies and regulations in the US, EN, and CA and perhaps other countries as well."
"9463496","Project Summary Stress exposure is one of the major triggers of unipolar depressive disorders, debilitating conditions whose core symptoms include changes in reward processing and responsiveness to environmental stimuli. However, despite the importance of this motivational dysregulation, the relationship between depression and neural processes that mediate appetitive responses to environmental has still not been precisely synthesized. We have identified a neurochemical signaling pathway that is disrupted by stress exposure in a manner that may be instrumental in mediating motivational symptoms of depressive disorders. We have demonstrated that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) increases dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens of stress- naïve male animals, but stress exposure ablates this neurochemical crosstalk for a prolonged period of time. In the proposed work we will directly characterize the role of CRF/dopamine interactions in mediating reward processing and its disruption by stress exposure and in particular the changes that take place in responding to reward-associated stimuli. We will also test whether CRF/dopamine interactions are similar in females or whether they are sexually dimorphic. The importance of integrating females into these studies is not only because they represent half of the population, but also because their response to stressors differ from those in males both quantitatively and qualitatively."
"9600336","PROJECT SUMMARY Even with currently available antibiotics, bacterial pneumonia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in influenza pandemics and epidemics. Influenza infection typically induces IFN production in the lung; however, multiple studies have demonstrated that both type 1 and type 2 IFN are detrimental to innate antibacterial immunity after influenza. The intracellular protein Suppressor Of Cytokine Signaling 1 (SOCS1) is a feedback inhibitor of IFN/STAT1 signaling. Interestingly, preliminary studies show that rather than preventing the detrimental effect of IFNs, SOCS1 enhances host susceptibility to secondary pneumococcal infection. Accordingly, the major goal of this application is to identify cellular and molecular factors directly involved in SOCS1-dependent exacerbation of secondary bacterial infection. The central hypothesis is that after influenza infection, SOCS1 modulation of lung immune environment impairs host innate defense against secondary pneumococcal infection. To test this hypothesis, Specific Aim 1 will determine the impact of influenza-induced SOCS1 on lung cytokine response and antibacterial immunity; and Specific Aim 2 will determine the role of cellular SOCS1 in T cells and alveolar macrophages during post-influenza pneumococcal infection. The long- term goal of this research is to identify targets and therapeutics to reverse this susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonia in humans."
"9476899","Project Summary Health challenges linked to human aging take a tremendous toll on our society. Physical and cognitive decline limit the quality of life for the elderly and their caregivers. Aging is the major risk factor for, and possible cause of cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease, and thus struggle with debilitating disease is a common health burden for the aging population. Without question, the promotion of healthy aging with extended resistance to decline should be a major objective of current medical research. To investigate healthy aging, simple animals models such as the nematode C. elegans have been used to provide molecular insights into the genes and chemical compound interventions that can modulate conserved aging processes likely to act similarly in humans. The goal of the proposed work is to continue, and expand, efforts of a co-operative scientific group involving three closely interacting laboratories who coordinately test pharmacological interventions for their ability to extend healthy aging and promote longevity in nematodes. A specific emphasis of this integrated super-group is to test promising drugs on a collection of natural variants of the Caenorhabditis genus, which together represent the extensive genetic heterogeneity in the human population. The idea is that treatments that confer positive outcomes across a diverse population will have an increased chance of being efficacious in higher organisms and will be suggested as priority interventions for testing in pre-clinical mouse studies and possibly future human trials. The emphasis of this specific proposal is the screening of test compounds for the capacity to promote a range of indicators of strong health in older age. We will focus on measures with parallels to human aging: locomotory decline, diminished resistance to stress, deterioration of cardiac-like muscle function, disruption of intestinal barrier function, and accumulation of age-related pigments in non-dividing cells. Our findings will be integrated with parallel evaluation of the same compound interventions on longevity, so that we can define treatments that promote the quality and functionality of older age life, rather than those that simply extend life. Overall, we will participate in a unique team project that has the power to define pharmacological interventions that robustly promote strong healthspan across a varied population, with implications for development of therapies that promote healthy human aging.  "

"9498624","GPR55 is a lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI)-sensitive G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that recognizes a sub- set of cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 ligands. The goal of the proposed project is to understand the functional features of GPR55 that may define mechanisms of drug-receptor interactions relevant to physiological and pathophysiological function, including drug abuse. GPR55 has been implicated in inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain, metabolic disorder, bone and neurological development, and cancer, indicating the real potential of GPR55 ligands as therapeutics. Each of these areas alone is medically important and each would benefit by the use of selective agonists and antagonists to further studies. While selective agonists and antagonists for GPR55 from a number of diverse scaffolds have been identified, no low nanomolar potency ligands have been confirmed for this receptor, nor is there a radioligand developed to characterize binding. We have recently identified the first set of GPR55 residues important for agonist signaling and for GPR55 activation. This information should aid in the rational design of next generation GPR55 ligands, using our evolving molecular model. The goal of this proposal is to use structure-based design and cheminformatics tools to develop structure-activity relationships for selected scaffolds, leading to the identification of low nanomolar ligands that retain high receptor selectivity. We aim to discover nanomolar potency GPR55 ligands using a combination of molecular modeling, chemoinformatics, high-throughput screening and site directed mutagenesis. We will dissect the specific signaling pathways governing GPR55 activity as well as investigate ligand bias."
"9655182","Project Summary/Abstract  Over the past 15 years, we have focused our efforts primarily on Caribbean Hispanics from the Dominican Republic because the frequency of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is higher than in non-Hispanic whites and blacks, the families are large, there are relatively few founders, and there is strong evidence of inbreeding. In the previous funding cycle we met our recruitment goals, identified functional mutations in SORL1, initiated a large-scale genome wide association study (GWAS) and begun targeted re-sequencing and whole exome sequencing in Caribbean Hispanic families. Genetic analysis of LOAD has focused on common genetic variants using GWAS in unrelated patients and controls that may explain ~35% of the genetic variance of LOAD. Studies of rare variants are now beginning to emerge, particularly in family-based cohorts.  As a result of preliminary work over the three previous funding cycles, we are in a very strong position for this renewal: 1) We have assembled a large cohort of unrelated Caribbean Hispanic LOAD cases and elderly controls and have identified several hundred families multiply affected by LOAD. 2) We investigated genome- wide (global burden) analyses of runs of homozygosity showing that the average run is significantly longer in cases than controls and stronger yet in familial LOAD, suggesting the existence of novel recessive LOAD gene(s). A locus-specific ROH analysis also revealed a genome-wide significant consensus region on chr9q34. 3) We have initiated a large scale GWAS of all families and a case-control cohort that will include over seven thousand subjects. A preliminary analysis has identified several putative associations with LOAD. 4) We have begun an analysis of data from a preliminary targeted re-sequencing of LOAD candidate genes, and whole exome sequencing (WES) in 115 members of 31 multiplex families. 5) Another 353 members of 67 multiplex families from this same cohort were included in the whole genome sequencing (WGS) study of the NIA/NHGRI Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project and analyses of these data are underway. Results of both analyses will be available to us near or just after the start date of this revised proposal.  To take advantage of these resources and capitalize on our preliminary findings, we propose to use the results from the GWAS (Hispanic and non-Hispanic), analyses of runs of homozygosity, WES and WGS analyses from our population of Caribbean Hispanics, to conduct targeted re-sequencing in genes (loci), or pathways showing putative relationships to LOAD, followed by replication and validation genotyping, in silico bioinformatic and biophysical analyses of variant sequences identifying effects on gene structure and biological assays of gene function.  The central hypothesis we are testing is that, as yet unidentified, common and rare genetic variants underlie the pathobiology of LOAD and can be found in large well-phenotyped multiplex families, cases and controls."
"9528212","Genomic Resources for the Collaborative Cross In response to NIH FOA PAR-17-273  PI: Leonard McMillan We propose to develop unique and unprecedented genomic resources for the experimental genetics community in support of the Collaborative Cross (CC). The CC is an emergent genetics resource consisting of more than seventy new isogenic mouse strains with genomes derived from eight founders that captures most of diversity in Mus musculus. As reported in June?s issue of Genetics, we have recently done full-genome sequencing for samples from each CC strain. The Aims of this proposal will be: 1. To assemble and annotate unique individual genomes for each reproducible CC strain. 2. To provide tools that aid in experimental designs using the CC. In particular, how to design  recombinant inbred intercrosses, that provide a sufficiently sized set of balanced and  reproducible outbred samples. We will also provide tools that fix particular genes for testing  against variable genetic backgrounds. 3. We propose to develop custom -omics analysis pipelines that leverage the unprecedented  genomics annotation available for the CC to support the exploration allele specific effects. Our primary goal is to bootstrap the use of the CC within the medical research community, with the hopes that after the five years of support these resources will be self-sustaining through selling mice by the UNC System?s Genetics Core facility. This proposal has two Principal Investigators (PIs). The contact PI is Professor Leonard McMillan from UNC?s department of Computer Science. He is joined by PI Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena, PhD. Dr. McMillan has been the primary bioinformatics expert and tool developer for the CC over the past 8+ years of its development. Dr. Pardo-Manuel de Villena is a geneticist who led the development of the Collaborative Cross. Together we bring extensive expertise in computational biology, genetics, and genomics to ensure that the CC is the premier mammalian genetic reference population and a source of new mouse models of human disease."
"9478104","PROJECT SUMMARY Chromatin modifiers integrate environmental stimuli to physiological outputs via epigenetic changes, which can be long lasting and even transcend generations. Chromatin remodeling has been found to extend lifespan in several organisms, but how chromatin modifiers promote longevity is unknown. We have made the tantalizing observation that deficiency in the COMPASS methyltransferase complex, which trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), leads to lifespan extension in C. elegans that is causally coupled to changes in fat metabolism. Intriguingly, H3K4me3 modifiers act in the germline of C. elegans to trigger fat metabolism changes in somatic tissues, suggesting a non-cell autonomous signaling between germline and soma for fat metabolism. Using high throughput mass spectrometry, we find H3K4me3-methyltransferase deficient worms are enriched for several specific mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs): oleic acid, palmitoleic acid, and cis- vaccenic acid. This fat metabolic switch to MUFAs requires a conserved network involving the transcription factors SPB-1/SREBP1, NHR-49/PPAR?, and delta-9 fatty acid desaturases, and remarkably endogenous MUFA accumulation is necessary for lifespan extension. Interestingly, dietary supplementation of individual MUFAs is sufficient to extend lifespan in worms. Excessive fat storage has been associated with diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes, but our data suggest fat composition is critical, and that epigenetic remodeling can result in specific fatty acids that increase longevity. Because the genes that generate unsaturated fatty acids are highly conserved throughout evolution, endogenous or dietary MUFAs could promote longevity in humans. Exciting new questions raised by these observations are: how is MUFA metabolism influenced by epigenetic changes and environmental stimuli? How is the communication between germline and somatic tissues orchestrated to influence fat composition? Are the changes in fat composition inherited in the progeny in a transgenerational manner? And how do MUFAs act to extend lifespan? C. elegans is an excellent model for fat metabolism because of its genetic power and because the machinery for conversion of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids is entirely conserved. This proposal will test the hypothesis that epigenetic changes in H3K4me3 in the germline initiates a signal that induces a switch to MUFA accumulation in specific somatic tissues, resulting in lifespan extension. Three specific aims will be developed to test this new idea: 1. To determine how germline H3K4me3 modifiers lead to change in somatic fat composition in parents and progeny. 2. To identify the molecular mechanisms that induce a switch to mono-unsaturated fatty acids and longevity in response to altered germline H3K4me3 and environmental stimuli. 3. To characterize the regulation and mode of action of specific fatty acids that promote longevity. These studies will give mechanistic insights into specific fat metabolism regulation in the germline and potentially discover new signaling molecules that inform the soma of the metabolic status of the germline. Furthermore, the proposed experiments will identify the critical pathways linking epigenetic changes to fat metabolism across generations. Finally, this work in C. elegans will determine how fat metabolism can have benefits on healthspan and lifespan, and provide the foundation to test the conserved role of MUFA metabolism in other species."

"9526698","The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center."
"9697460","DESCRIPTION: In the last decade, HIV incidence rates among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in U.S. urban centers have steadily increased. To shed light on these trends, since 2009, we have been conducting a cohort study of n = 600 racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse YMSM, informed by a theory of syndemics, to: (1) develop and test theoretically informed measurement models of the covariance of illicit drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden among emergent adult HIV-negative YMSM within and across time; (2) assess whether patterns of behavior are continuous, discontinuous, or some combination of both; (3) delineate the risk and protective base (physical, relational, and psychosocial factors) that predict the development of syndemics: and (4) determine the extent to which the development of syndemics is moderated by race/ethnicity, social class, and homelessness/housing stability. At baseline, participants were 18-19 years old and are returning for semi-annual follow-up visits; to date we have high levels of participant retention (e83%) across study visits. Presently, we seek to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the health of this new generation of YMSM. This will be accomplished by (a) continuing to investigate the original study aims as participants mature to ages 25-26; and (b) including two new, complementary study aims to: (1) describe the social and sexual networks of YMSM, and examine the relationship between social and sexual network-level structural characteristics, social support and normative influences on syndemic production in YMSM, singly and in combination with physical, psychosocial, and relational predictors, both within and across time; and (2) describe the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), specifically, gonorrhea chlamydia, and syphilis, among YMSM within and across time, and to determine whether physical, relational, and psychosocial factors explain STI acquisition within and across time. We will continue to test syndemic production over time as well as to examine how this comprehensive range of physical, psychosocial, and relational predictors are related to syndemic production using additive and multiplicative (synergistic) models. Next, for YMSM in this study who have seroconverted as well as those who may seroconvert, we include an exploratory aim to describe HIV clinical treatment markers (i.e., HIV viral load, ART uptake and adherence, HIV care) and to assess the extent to which physical, relational, and psychosocial factors are associated with these clinical markers, both within and across time. We seek to extend our cohort study through the addition of semi- annual data collection for 7 additional waves of data collection. We will recruit an additional n = 329 to add to our extent study sample. New recruits will be 21-22 years old at enrollment, and with our original n=471 active and available YMSM participants, will yield a sample of n = 800 at the first assessment of our competing continuation study. As with our current study we will utilize complex modeling (Structural Equation and Latent Growth Curve Analysis and Survival Analysis) to answer our study questions."
"9269902","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With half of U.S. pregnancies each year being unintended there is a great need to seek novel approaches to address this persistent public health issue. Efforts that expand access to highly effective methods of contraception to women at high risk of unintended pregnancy have demonstrated reductions in unintended pregnancies and abortions. Women presenting for emergency contraception (EC) comprise an ideal population in which to initiate highly effective reversible contraception, as they are at a high rik of unintended pregnancy and are acting to reduce that risk.  The copper IUD possesses two advantages over the common oral hormonal methods of EC: it is the most effective method of EC and it continues to provide highly effective contraception for up to 12 years. Our recent publication demonstrated a significantly lower pregnancy rate 12 months after presenting for EC among women who selected the copper IUD versus those who selected oral levonorgestrel (LNG). However, women selecting intrauterine contraception have shown a strong preference for the levonorgestrel (LNG) IUD because it reduces or eliminates menstrual bleeding and discomfort. As the LNG20 IUDs effectiveness for EC remains unknown our multi-disciplinary Family Planning Research Group proposes a randomized controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the LNG IUD as EC. The main goal of this research is to evaluate the innovative use of the LNG20 IUD alone for EC in a population of predominantly low-income women.  Utilizing the same clinical sites we have consistently employed to study the IUD for EC since 2008 we will randomly assign 706 women presenting for EC to either the LNG20 IUD or the copper T380 IUD. Our primary aim is to assess the efficacy of the LNG20 IUD vs. the copper T380 IUD for EC utilizing a non- inferiority design. We will also assess one-year continuation and unintended pregnancy rates in women initiating the LNG20 IUD or copper T380 IUD for EC and study the mechanisms of continuation related to satisfaction, pain, and bleeding over the first year of use.  This proposal builds on the strong foundation laid by our successful R21 assessing the copper IUD for EC and serves as the next innovation in our growing research program offering highly effective reversible contraception at the time women present for EC. Demonstrating the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of the LNG20 IUD for EC will improve options for women seeking EC and has the potential to eliminate a significant barrier to IUD initiation, increase IUD use, and lower the persistently high rate of unintended pregnancy in the U.S. 1"
"9523840","Project Summary: Drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) remains a difficult biomedical challenge, affecting approximately one-third of newly-treated cases of epilepsy. Individuals impacted by DRE endure a poor quality of life, and can face life-threatening complications. Surgical removal of epileptogenic tissue can dramatically reduce seizures and improve quality of life. However, epilepsy surgery can be highly invasive, may produce damage that is not restricted to the target tissue, and is not feasible in certain critical areas of the brain. Also, surgical damage that is not conformal to its target and affects neighboring, eloquent tissue can produce long- term functional deficits. Finally, incomplete resection or ablation of target tissue can result in poor seizure management. The purpose of this proposal is to develop and test a non-invasive, targeted, conformal surgical strategy that will optimize seizure control, expand the types of epilepsies amenable to surgical intervention, and, ultimately, improve the quality of life of patients with DRE. This project will utilize Magnetic Resonance- guided, low-intensity Focused Ultrasound (MRg-FUS) to focally and reversibly open the blood brain barrier (BBB) in a targeted manner without producing a thermal lesion. Transient opening of the BBB allows timed delivery of an otherwise BBB-impermeable neurotoxin to the brain parenchyma in order to produce a focal, axon-sparing lesion of targeted neurons. The neurotoxin Quinolinic Acid (QA) is well tolerated when administered systemically at high dosages, exhibits little or no permeability through the intact BBB, is relatively unaffected by glutamatergic uptake systems in the brain parenchyma, and is capable of producing axon- sparing lesions. We present here the first evidence that systemically-administered QA combined with MRgFUS produces focal neuronal damage, while sparing axons in precisely targeted regions of the brain. Moreover, this approach affords the opportunity to treat targets that would be difficult, if not impossible, to treat using currently-available surgical techniques. Finally, these outcomes can be achieved while simultaneously limiting the risks of collateral damage, surgical side effects, and long-term neurological deficits. The current project will develop and test this novel approach for limiting seizures using a model of limbic epilepsy. The guiding hypothesis is that targeted disconnection of dysfunctional brain circuitry can be achieved in a precise, conformal, and non-invasive manner, and that this strategy can be implemented to control seizures and improve neurological outcomes. This approach provides distinct advantages over current surgical modalities as it will restrict the extent of tissue damage, allow treatment of regions that are otherwise inaccessible, reduce peri-surgical complications, mitigate against long-term functional deficits, and do all of this in a non-invasive manner. Notably, this strategy could prove useful for treating a variety of neurological disorders in which disturbances in connectivity play a role."
"9508624","Asthma is a common, chronic disease that affects millions of people of all ages globally, and the prevalence of asthma has increased markedly in recent years. Similar to other complex, chronic diseases that are also major health burdens, one of the key drivers in asthma pathogenesis is inflammation. A deeper understanding of metabolic pathways that play a critical role in inflammation, the genetic variation that underpin these pathways, and how these factors relate to asthma, is warranted. Both environmental exposures and genetic factors influence asthma susceptibility, severity and disease progression. Metabolites are also influenced by both genetic variation and environmental factors, and metabolomics is a powerful new `omics' tool for elucidating disease pathogenesis. Although inflammatory processes represent one of the key pathways associated with asthma risk to date, metabolomic studies on asthma have been limited in terms of sample size and number. Furthermore, the integration of genomics and metabolomics has the potential to clarify causal disease mechanisms. Genes encode enzymes, and the downstream effect of genetic variation on enzymatic activity is also captured by metabolomics. Genetic variants that are associated with metabolite variation are referred to as metabolite quantitative trait loci (mtQTLs). The intersection of genotype-metabolite and genotype-phenotype associations can deliver new insights into complex disease.  Between 1993-2001, our team performed a whole population ascertainment of Tangier Island, Virginia, an isolated European-ancestry population in the Chesapeake Bay. We characterized the full extended pedigree tracing back to three founders in 1722, and collected biospecimens and clinical phenotype measurements of cardiovascular and allergic disease (including asthma), on all eligible, consenting participants. This cohort also has a homogenous dietary environment typical of modern Western diets, which is itself a risk factor for inflammatory disease. Here, we propose using the Tangier Island biobank to generate a metabolomics and genomics data resource to characterize the underpinnings of asthma. Specifically, we aim to: 1A) Identify perturbations between asthma cases and controls of molecules and pathways previously known to be associated with lung inflammation; 1B) Identify sets of correlated metabolites most closely associated with asthma and its associated trait, total serum IgE (tIgE), and identify biological pathways enriched for these metabolite sets; 2) Estimate metabolite heritability to elucidate the genetic vs. environmental contribution to metabolite variation; 3) Perform mtQTL mapping and use these results to identify genetic variants contributing to the relative abundance of metabolites affecting asthma. Findings from these aims will provide critical data for a future R01 application to refine and pinpoint causal mechanisms in inflammation and asthma, and will provide an invaluable integrative omics resource to the scientific community."
"9600878","ABSTRACT While survival after sudden cardiac arrest (CA) has improved with modern resuscitation efforts, survivors can exhibit multiple motor and cognitive impairments due to the neurological sequelae resulting from the associated hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI). Further, these survivors represent a ?new? population for rehabilitationists to treat who have these impairments. Current practice is to borrow management strategies used with other acquired brain injury populations to manage issues like low cognitive arousal, agitation/restlessness, depression/anxiety, and movement disorders (myoclonus). However, the pathology underlying these seemingly overlapping symptoms may be very different depending on the etiology of the brain injury. Our pilot data using fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV), a method to conduct in vivo, real-time characterization of presynaptic DA transmission in a model of mild ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest (VF-CA). Our data show that by 2 weeks after VF-CA, there are substantial increases in maximal striatal evoked DA overflow, and there is increased DA transporter (DAT) expression to partially compensate for dysregulated increases in evoked DA overflow. Increased evoked striatal DA overflow can be further augmented with increasing severity of the VF-CA insult. Together, the data suggest DA transmission derangements after experimental VF-CA are very different than what is observed with similar studies done in our laboratory with experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), where there are significant DA transmission deficits and also compensatory striatal DAT expression reductions. We also show that we can elicit myoclonus behavior in this VF-CA model and that striatal neuroinflammation (e.g. high TNF?) is a prominent feature of VF-CA, which may impact both striatal DA transmission and behavior after CA. We also show that asphyxial CA (ACA) yields more neurological injury when compared with a similar VF- CA insult and unique neuroinflammation patterns. Together, the data suggest a need for different clinical treatment strategies used to treat the CA population clinically than what is used to treat TBI. Thus our goal is to develop multiple CA models of survival that can be used as a test bed for examining rehabilitation focused treatments that impact inflammation, DA neurotransmission and associated behavioral deficits. We hypothesize 1) striatal damage and inflammation associated with HIBI results in dysregulated increases in presynaptic DA transmission profiles over time that are sensitive to CA model type (VF-CA vs. ACA) and insult severity 2) altered DA transmission and striatal damage associated with HIBI is associated with myoclonus, cognitive deficits, and maladaptive behaviors. Our goal is use this model to understand mechanisms underlying observed changes in DA neurotransmission and responsiveness to dopamine modulation and reduction agents. This translational research collaboration is a novel extension of our excellence in CA clinical care program. The proposed work marks a paradigm shift in how we rehabilitate those surviving CA as we begin a research pipeline that identifies tailored and effective treatments for rehabilitation and recovery for the population surviving CA."
"9552035","APOE ?4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed project will examine the effect of APOE genotype on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) DHA levels and on changes in structural and functional brain connectivity in cognitively healthy older individuals in response to DHA supplementation. DHA is an essential omega-3 fatty acid critical to neuronal functions, and is not formed in sufficient amounts de novo. DHA is highly enriched in cortical grey matter and is more concentrated at synapses where it plays a role in synaptic plasticity. DHA is depleted in AD brains. Randomized clinical trials have yielded mixed results on the effect DHA on cognitive outcomes. This study asks the critical question of whether DHA gets into the brain in sufficient amounts after supplementation, and whether APOE genotype affects brain penetrance. Mice carrying the human APOE ?4 allele have decreased brain delivery of DHA compared to mice expressing the APOE ?2 or the APOE ?3 allele. High dose DHA supplementation prevents AD pathology in APOE ?4 transgenic mouse models. Our preliminary data indicate lower DHA concentrations in the CSF of cognitively healthy APOE ?4 carriers compared to non-carriers. We hypothesize that APOE ?4 carriers have reduced delivery of DHA to the CSF that can be reversed upon high dose DHA supplementation. To address this hypothesis, we propose a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of high dose (2 grams/day) of DHA over 6 months in 160 cognitively healthy participants stratified by APOE status (?4 vs. non ?4 carriers). The primary outcome is the effect of APOE genotype on CSF DHA levels in response to DHA supplementation. We will examine red blood cell DHA concentrations as a peripheral biomarker following the 24-week trial. Our secondary outcomes are changes in brain structural and functional connectivity assessed by resting state functional MRI, and changes in cognition. APOE ?4 is associated with blood-brain barrier breakdown, hypolipidated apoE HDL, and brain amyloid deposition. To provide insights into mechanisms regulating DHA brain delivery, our second aim is to examine the association of the change in CSF DHA levels during supplementation with measures of blood-brain barrier integrity (assessed by the CSF albumin quotient), DHA content of apoE particles in CSF, and CSF A?42 levels. The results of these studies will provide novel information that can be used clinically to design personalized approaches for the prevention of AD in high-risk individuals. Given the safety profile, availability, and affordability of DHA, refining a DHA intervention in APOE ?4 carriers can have significant impact on reducing AD incidence."
"9559209","Project Summary Mobility limitations including gait and balance impairments are common in older adults, especially those with neurological de?cits. Gait and balance impairments are a major cause of falls and reduced quality of life. Although laboratory studies show that biofeedback during exercise training can improve motor performance, physical ther- apists do not have access to an overground gait biofeedback system for their patients. We will use this Phase II grant to 1) develop Mobility Rehab, a ?exible biofeedback system to provide visual and verbal biofeedback for gait training overground or on a treadmill for older adults with neurological de?cits, 2) thoroughly verify and validate Mobility Rehab in preparation for an FDA 510(k) clearance to market, and 3) use a pragmatic clinical trial to evaluate the e?ectiveness of Mobility Rehab on three hundred patients in a physical therapy clinic. This 2-year project has two speci?c aims: AIM I: Prepare Mobility Rehab for commercialization (APDM). The objective of this aim is to optimize the visual feedback, add a verbal commands mode, and prepare the system for a commercial launch for personalized rehabilitation in the clinic. AIM II: Determine the e?ectiveness of Mobility Rehab for gait training in adults with mobility disturbances (OHSU and NWRA). We predict that Mobility Rehab will be more e?ective for mobility rehabilitation than regular rehabilitation for adults with mobility disturbances."
"9541173","Project Summary/Abstract Inherited retinal degenerative diseases affect approximately 3.5 million people worldwide. Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) causes progressive degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptor cells, resulting in the complete loss of vision. Nevertheless, surviving retinal neurons downstream of photoreceptor cells provide an exciting entry point for therapy. Several approaches including the use of microbial opsins and implanted electrode arrays within these downstream cell types have restored useful features of vision, however, low light-sensitivity, invasiveness, and poor resolution, describe some of the challenges of these methods. The research proposed here, seeks to dramatically advance vision restoration using a novel optogenetic approach based on native retinal receptors that support vision of natural scenes at natural intensities, without the need for an exogenously applied photoswitch. This will be done using a combination of experimental techniques including molecular biology, AAV-mediated gene transfer, multielectrode array recordings, two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology, and visually-guided behavioral assays. Several native retinal light sensors, rhodopsin and melanopsin, have been ectopically expressed by our lab and others in remaining retinal cells of a mouse model of human RP. While these studies elegantly demonstrate the efficacy of converting retinal cells lacking intrinsic photosensitivity into functional pseudo-photoreceptor cells with high light sensitivity, and capable of restoring basic features of vision, both receptors suffer from kinetics too slow to support vision in motion. The research plan describes a method to uniquely combine both sensitivity comparable to that of rhodopsin, together with speed, in neurons of the inner retina that survive for decades following photoreceptor cell loss. This effort will provide crucial insight on the most essential components required for meaningful, complex visual restoration and a potential foundation for future treatments of inherited retinal degenerative diseases."
"9468375","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due to the rapid growth in biomedically related industries, there is a crucial need to provide appropriate training for the emerging workforce that will be responsible for translating new devices and technologies from the bench to the bedside. Students need exposure to research, clinical, and industrial environments to provide a solid foundation and understanding of the complex and diverse nature of biomedical engineering. To meet this need, we propose to expand our 6-credit team-based interdisciplinary senior design program to include clinically motivated projects identified during previous clinical immersion experiences. Within the context of the design project the students will identify the significance o the unmet clinical need and impact of finding a practical solution, outline the design constraints, and generate a working prototype as a solution to the unmet clinical need. The goals of this proposal are to (a) translate the unmet clinical needs into open-ended, team-based senior design projects to provide true bench-to-bedside problem solving opportunities, (b) broaden the students exposure and understanding of challenges that are specific to clinical environments while strengthening communication skills with clinical professionals, and (c) evaluate the effectiveness of the incorporation of clinically driven design projects into the senior design program. Ultimately we hope that exposure to guided but open-ended challenges from clinical professionals will broaden the students' understanding of the biomedical field, create effective engineering solutions to address clinical needs, and prepare students for careers in biomedical engineering."
"9509082","Project Summary Evolutionary medicine leverages the power of naturally occurring phenotypic differences to investigate genetic mechanisms underlying diseases, including neurological and metabolic disorders. The Mexican cavefish exhibits a dramatic evolution of sleep loss, hyperphagia, and obesity compared to a surface fish of the same species, thus, providing a unique and powerful model for identifying genetic factors regulating these traits. The proposed experiments will implement genomic and transgenic technology in Mexican cavefish to identify genetic loci that contribute to sleep, feeding, and metabolism. In addition, these experiments have potential to identify whether shared genetic architecture underlies changes in these traits, providing insight into the relationship between sleep loss and metabolic disorders. Specifically, the contribution of cave-associated alleles in Hypocretin receptor 2 to sleep, feeding, and adiposity within a surface fish genetic background will be investigated. Beyond the immediate scientific goals, transgenic and genomic tools and techniques will be established and will provide a valuable resource and can be applied to address questions beyond the scope in this proposal, including in investigations of eye-degeneration and autism."
"9594381","Abstract Time of day is a strong determinant of our experience: waking, sleeping, meals, and working occur in predictable patterns. Endogenous clocks in the brain and peripheral tissues control the appropriate timing of physiology and behavior. But people are not all synchronized in the same way?some have an early chronotype (larks) and some have a late chronotype (owls). As with more severe disruptions of the clock, delayed chronotype is a predictor of sleep disorders, metabolic disease, and neurological disorders. Importantly, chronotype also differs between sexes, so differences in biological clock function may explain some of the sex biases in these pathologies. We have previously shown that (1) circadian clock function is strongly influenced by steroid hormones in males but not in females, (2) this is due to a change in the sensitivity of the clock to light, and (3) this is traceable to the effects of androgens on light-responsive neurons that express androgen receptors (AR) in the suprachiasmatic nucleus?the location of the brain?s circadian clock. Though lacking AR, the same neuronal population exists in females. The circadian clock is therefore an excellent system to determine the structural and functional pathways by which biological sex and androgen signaling control a circadian clock function (free-running period of the clock) and an output behavior (chronotype) that have relevance for health. We hypothesize that androgens reduce the clock?s photosensitivity to compensate for underlying organizational differences and thereby ensure similar behavior patterns between males and females. We will first investigate how androgens affect the excitability of identified AR-expressing neurons (Aim 1) and how this alters the spatiotemporal network of the brain?s clock (Aim 2). Next, we test how the presence of the receptor affects rhythmic behavior and light sensitivity (Aim 3). Finally, we will pharmacogenetically manipulate AR neurons for the first time in any neuronal system to determine the role that these neurons play in organizing clock function and controlling its response to light (Aim 4). These Aims are enabled by two important mouse models: one in which the AR can be knocked out conditionally, and one in which AR neurons express CRE recombinase. Using the latter, SCN neurons expressing AR can be identified and manipulated by pharmacogenetics."
"9493259","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We request support to replace our aging and obsolete Varian Inova 600 MHz NMR console and failed cold probe. The 600 MHz NMR instrument at the University of Colorado School of medicine has been in operation for over 20 years, and in that time it has supported over 30 different federally funded research groups from five research institutions, including from local biotechnology companies. The products of this research have results in over 100 publications, many in high impact journals. However, the electronics console and probes have come to the end of their life, and are suffering from an increasing number of potentially fatal breakdowns, such that it can no longer perform critical experiments required by the current generation of NIH funded researchers. Further, Agilent/Varian have withdrawn from the NMR market and are winding down their support operations for NMR spectroscopy. At this time there is no clear mechanism to maintain operation of this spectrometer in the long term. A recent failure of the existing Varian coldprobe has accelerated the necessity to replace and upgrade this equipment. Purchase of a new Bruker Avance Neo console with the latest generation of cryoprobes will restore full operation of this spectrometer, allow researchers to take advantage of the latest development in NMR methods and hardware, and accelerate the pace of scientific discovery. This new console and probe will be installed on the existing Oxford Instruments 14T NMR magnet, and restore the spectrometer to full operations. The new console will ensure that the NMR Core facility is able to continue to provide essential services to its users into the future. The research and educational programs supported by the CU NMR facility cover a broad range of topics from cancer biology, infectious disease, neuro-degeneration and epigenetics through to more basic investigations into the role of protein dynamics, and fundamental NMR methods development. Many of the systems under investigation are high priority targets for drug discovery. The NMR core also supports the work of synthetic chemists in a range of fields including drug development, bioengineering, and biopolymers for medical devices and dental applications. Almost all of these research programs will benefit dramatically from the enhanced capabilities of the new system. The dramatic increase in sensitivity (~70%) improved salt tolerance and the ability to directly detect 13C, will permit study of more challenging systems, reduce costs and enhance research productivity. The critical importance of this instrument to the University of Colorado research community has been recognized with the commitment of substantial matching funds in support of this instrument."
"9581166","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Close to 50 million families provide more than 85% of long-term care to older adults with complex chronic conditions. Family caregivers (CGs) typically assume care responsibilities without training or support and may in turn experience multiple health risks themselves including depression. Identifying innovative approaches for reaching this large population and providing evidence-based supportive programs to enhance their well-being is a public health imperative. One approach to reach CGs is to augment existing community-based services with an evidence-based program. Adult day service (ADS) is one such growing and critical community-based option that CGs of older adults with complex conditions rely on. ADS programs offer out-of-home, supervised activities but do not routinely provide evidence-based supportive CG programs. Also ADS use is not consistently associated with reductions in CG depressive symptoms, client behavioral symptoms and nursing home admissions. Thus, ADS is an ideal test bed for translating a proven CG intervention to reach and support underserved CGs. We previously developed and evaluated in a small trial, ADS Plus, a program augmenting ADS with systematic support (e.g., education, skill building) to CGs. We showed that ADS Plus in comparison to usual ADS, reduced CG depression and nursing home placement. In response to NIA PA-14- 161 calling for translational research to integrate evidence-based models into existing services, we propose a practical trial design to assess the effectiveness and uptake of ADS Plus on a large scale. We will involve 30 ADS programs throughout the U.S. varying in geographic location and staffing levels and 300 CGs (150 in ADS Plus sites; 150 in ADS usual care sites). We will use cluster and re-randomization techniques, mixed methods, and cost analyses to rigorously evaluate program effectiveness and implementation processes. If effective, and with consultation from a Translation Advisory Board of key ADS leaders, ADS Plus will be disseminated widely. Primary study aims are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of ADS Plus to improve CG well-being and reduce depressive symptoms compared to routine ADS use at 6 months (Hypothesis 1: CGs in ADS Plus will report improved well-being and reductions in depressive symptoms compared to those in routine ADS only); and 2) evaluate long-term maintenance effects of ADS Plus at 12 months on CG well-being and depressive symptoms (Hypothesis 2: CGs using ADS Plus will maintain benefits from 6 to 12 months). Additional study aims will: 3) evaluate whether CGs using ADS Plus are more likely to maintain relatives in ADS and less likely to place them in residential settings compared to those in routine ADS over 12 months; 4) estimate ADS Plus costs and assess whether it results in net financial benefits when compared to usual ADS at 6 and 12 months; 5) evaluate the effects of ADS Plus on client behaviors and CG efficacy and upset managing symptoms; and 6) evaluate theoretically-derived (RE-AIM, Stress Process Model) mediational pathways of treatment change including CG acceptance and staff adoption of ADS Plus over 12 months."

"9507855","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for The OSU College of Optometry Clinical Center to serve as a clinical center for the Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial - Attention and Reading Trial (CITT-ART), a multicenter  randomized, placebo controlled, clinical trial designed to evaluate the effects of treatment for symptomatic convergence insufficiency (Cl) on measures of reading performance and attention in children.  'In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic Cl will be randomly assigned to 16 weeks of: 1) office-based vergence/ accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy. After 16 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome measures of reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-lll] reading comprehension subtest score) and attention (Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]) will be assessed by examiners masked to treatment group. The Gates MacGinitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Reading fluency, another test of attention, the Cl Symptom Survey, and clinical measures of Cl (i.e., the near point of convergence, and positive fissional vergence at near) will be other secondary outcome measures; also included will be assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading                                                                comprehension including pseudo word decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension. Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention will be assessed 1-year post treatment. This application documents our site's ability to recruit at least 36 subjects and to retain them fo 1 year after completion of treatment. Documentation is provided that our site has the appropriate personnel, equipment, and facilities to conduct the study in accordance with the CITT-ART Manual of Procedures (MOP). Complete details of the study rationale, design, and methods are contained in the Manual of Procedures (submitted with the Study Chair and Data Coordinating Center [DCC] applications). In addition to our center, there are 8 other optometric or ophthalmologic centers, the Study Chair at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, and the DCC at The Ohio State University Optometry Coordinating Center. Symptomatic Cl is a common vision disorder in children that is commonly associated with symptoms while reading (e.g. loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading 'slowly,-trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of Cl treatment on reading and attention is unknown. The results of the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and have important implications for educators, psychologists, and physicians who care for children with reading and attention problems. The findings will guide hypothesis development for future scientific investigations in children with vision disorders."
"9481805","DESCRIPTION: HIV-infected (HIV+) and elderly individuals are the main adult populations for whom pneumococcal vaccine is recommended as they are highly susceptible to Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), the leading cause of community acquired and in-hospital pneumonia in the U.S. and globally. In late fall 2012, a 13 valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (PPS) conjugate vaccine (PCV13) recommended for infants/children since 2010 and approved for adults since 2011, was recommended for HIV+ adults. The goal of this project, submitted in response to PAR 12-175 Multidisciplinary studies of HIV/AIDS and Aging, is to determine the effects of aging and HIV infection PCV13 response. In prior work, our group discovered links between B cell and antibody repertoire deficiencies and impaired PPS antibody responses in HIV+ individuals and identified novel functional activities of PPS antibodies that protect against pneumococcal sepsis and pneumonia in mice. Informed by these studies, we will perform in depth analyses of the serological, B cell, functional and molecular responses to PCV13 of middle aged (50-65 yrs) and elderly (>65 yrs) HIV+ and HIV- individuals and assemble the data into serological and molecular signatures of PCV13 response. We will use standard serological and functional assays along with novel assays of PPS antibody functional activity against clinically important pneumococcal serotypes that PCV13 was developed to prevent. Then, we will use systems biology to identify molecular mechanisms of PCV13 response and assemble B cell, serological and transcriptional profiles into biomarkers of response. The specific aims of this project are: 1) To determine the effects of age and HIV infection on the antibody and B cell response to PCV13; 2) To determine the effects of age and HIV infection on PCV13-elicited antibody functional activity; 3) To determine the effects of age and HIV infection on the molecular response to PCV13. As biomarkers of adult pneumococcal vaccine response are not available, those identified in this study will fill a major gap and provid a platform to decipher PCV13 efficacy, a roadmap to guide future vaccine use in elderly HIV+ and HIV- individuals, clues to improve vaccine immunogenicity, and pathways to develop new approaches to prevent pneumococcal disease in those who are most at risk."
"9512432","Abstract  During a successful Phase 2 effort, Etiometry collaborated with multiple world-class pediatric centers to develop, validate, and deploy novel analytics that combine multiple physiologic data streams into a probabilistic assessment of inadequate oxygen delivery to critically ill patients. The analytics were integrated into the Etiometry Platform with the goal of improving physician situational awareness and preventing adverse outcomes in post-surgical pediatric cardiac patients in the ICU. During this time the platform and the analytics received FDA 510(k) clearance and were deployed in six pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Units (CICUs). The Phase 2B effort will build on these achievements by expanding the platform?s capabilities and respective FDA cleared indications. The Etiometry Platform will integrate the new analytics into formal ICU patient care protocols that will be evaluated in a multi-center multi-arm adaptive randomization clinical trial. If successful, the results of will be used to support FDA clearance with specific claims of clinical effectiveness. The ultimate objective of the proposed SBIR effort will be demonstrate that the clinical analytics can significantly affect clinical outcomes of critically ill pediatric patients."
"9472793","Project Abstract Stress can have a profound detrimental impact on our behavior, predisposing us to anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression. Given the high prevalence of these disorders understanding the basic biological and psychological processes is vitally important if we wish to address these significant problems and develop effective treatments. One question in the literature is whether a single (acute) exposure to stress or repeated (chronic) stress has similar effects. A second question is how severe must stress be in order to produce detrimental effects. Do repeated mild stressful experiences have an added impact that equals that of a more severe acute stressor? Does chronic stress exposure have a greater impact than an equally intense acute stressful experience? Surprisingly, while there is a large basic science literature on stress, that literature simply does not answer these questions. This is because the methods employed have totally confounded the chronic nature of stress with its severity. Typically what is compared are a series of repeated stressors to a single instance of the same stress. But repeated instances mean that the stress is not only chronic it is also, in total, more severe. We have developed a method were we can independently manipulate the chronicity and severity of stress that will for the first time allow us to accurately answer these important questions. The work begins from our extensive use of an intense acute stressor and the database we have collected on its effects on physiology and behavior. The design of our acute stressor allows us to break it into 15 ?bits? than can be administered at one bit a day for 15 days because the acute stress repeats the same aversive stimulus 15 times over 90 min. We can also systematically vary the intensity of our aversive experience. Our preliminary data already indicate that chronic and acute stress provokes different behavioral responses. Our first aim tests the hypothesis that the differences occur because acute stress taps into a set of automatic ?nonassociative? processes while chronic stress taps into learning or associative conditioning processes. Our second aim focuses on the physiological and neural changes that are differentially provoked by chronic vs acute stressors. Additionally, we will determine to what extent stress severity and not chronicity is the culprit. The third aim focuses on manipulations designed to block the effects of stress to help elucidate how stress chronicity and severity produce their effects via different biological mechanisms. We also hypothesize that males and females have different thresholds for how severe a stressor must be to provoke maladaptive changes in behavior. That hypothesis if true can begin to help explain why anxiety disorders and depression are more prevalent in females."
"9600424","Necroptosis, a programmed and regulated form of necrosis, has emerged as an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of various forms of lung injuries resulting from respiratory virus infection, trauma, blood transfusion, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and sepsis. Unlike apoptosis, necroptosis causes cell membrane rupture and triggers inflammation through the release of damage-associated molecular patterns, such as mitochondrial DNA, high-mobility group protein B1, and interleukin-1. Necroptosis can be induced by the activation of tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) receptor, Toll-like receptors (TLR) 3 and 4 and by virus infection. Necroptosis induced by TNF receptor and TLR3 contributes to host cell death by respiratory virus infection as infection of both DNA and RNA viruses normally induces the production of TNF and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The current prevailing model of necroptosis is executed by receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) and the RIPK3-mediated phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). The central RIPK3-MLKL necroptosis pathway was originally discovered in transformed cancer cell lines and studied in murine models. In contrast, little has been done for necroptosis signaling pathway in primary normal human cells. This issue is considered important and should be addressed before moving the currently identified necroptosis targets to clinical trials. Hence, we seek to identify and define the necroptosis signal pathways in primary normal human lung epithelial cells. On the basis of our preliminary data, this resubmission R21 proposal will test the hypothesis that normal human lung epithelial cells may undergo necroptosis through novel signal pathways mediated by a yet unidentified RIPK1-independent but necrostatin-1/1s-sensitive kinase, which is different from murine lung epithelial cells. We will test the novel hypothesis in two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will identify the novel necrostatin-1/1s-sensitive kinase in human alveolar epithelial cells by utilizing human kinase siRNA library screening and if needed, an alternative proteomic approach; Aim 2 will define the novel kinase-mediated necroptosis signal pathways by TNF and dsRNA in primary human alveolar and airway epithelial cells. We anticipate that this proposal will identify the novel necrostatin-1/1s-sensitive kinase responsible for necroptosis in primary human lung epithelial cells. These studies will address gaps in our understanding of necroptosis signal pathways in primary normal human cells and thereby advance the field. The proposal may also identify a promising novel therapeutic target that could be further developed to control various forms of human lung injuries, in which lung epithelial cell death is generally a prominent feature."
"9532760","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Paracrine Wnt ligands participate in cell-cell communication by activating several different signaling pathways including the WNT/B-catenin pathway which stabilizes cytoplasmic b-catenin allowing it to enter the nucleus and activate transcription in partnership with LEF/TCF transcription factors, and non-canonical pathways that control epithelial planar cell polarity, the actin cytoskeleton, cell movements, and cell adhesion. These pathways can interact with each other, and perform critical functions in skin and hair follicle development and disease. However, the mechanisms by which signaling is limited and controlled to provide proper patterning of hair follicle development, and the ligands, receptors and downstream components that provide specificity to Wnt functions in the skin are incompletely identified. Delineating the components of these pathways and dissecting their mechanisms of action will be critical for developing strategies for skin and hair follicle regeneration in cases of congenital absence or loss, and for the treatment of hair growth disorders and epidermal tumors. To determine the mechanisms by which WNT/b-catenin signaling is controlled and patterned in the skin, uncover novel functions of non-canonical Wnt signaling, and identify receptors mediating these pathways, we will: (1) Identify secreted inhibitors that limit WNT/B-catenin pathway activity and pattern hair follicle development in embryonic skin; (2) Determine whether the non-canonical Wnt pathway components Daam1 and Daam2 act downstream of Wnt5a and control proliferation and hair follicle stem cell maintenance by regulating the actin cytoskeleton; (3) Test the hypothesis that the closely related Wnt receptors Fzd1 and Fzd2 mediate both b-catenin-dependent and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways in developing and hair follicles and epidermis."

"9472227","DEVELOPMENTAL RESEARCH PROJECT PROGRAM SUMMARY The Developmental Research Project Program (DRPP) will support an expanded cadre of investigators in the HiSREP network under INBRE IV, substantially expanding, in turn, the capacity and hence opportunity for biomedical research in Hawaii. Building on the success in INBRE III where the DRPP focused support on promising junior investigators (JIs) at three primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), DRPP in INBRE IV will additionally offer multiple competitive funding mechanisms with opportunity for investigators at all levels, a richer program in professional development, and wider, organized access to core facilities, instrumentation and bioinformatics / biostatistics support. In addition to identification of new JIs at our PUIs, the new competitive granting mechanisms will be: Pilot Projects, New Initiatives, Collaborative Grants and Teaching-Postdoctoral Fellowships. For all of the grants, collaborations will be encouraged; however, for Collaborative Grants, priority will be given for joint proposals from a PUI investigator and a R1 Lead Institution mid-career or senior investigator as part of an integrated research team. Connection of all research to the two themes, Natural Products and Molecular Medicine, will be emphasized, particularly through availability of unique resources, such as biorepositories, and programmatic expertise, such as the UH Cancer Center Natural Products & Experimental Therapeutics (NPET) program. For awardees, expectations and outcomes will be guided by scientific and career mentoring plans, balanced by the teacher-scholar model for faculty at PUIs and CCs, where teaching demands are significant. This will be coupled to transparent investigator, project and administration assessments, leading to constructive exchange and responsive action plans. Lastly, a strongly supportive role for the lead institution is providing resource access (grant management, core instrument facilities, tissue and animal work, bioinformatics, biostatistics).  DRPP will accomplish its objectives through three specific aims: (1) Provide catalytic funding to support emerging research across the spectrum of investigators in the HiSREP network; (2) Provide multifaceted mentoring and professional development programs to emerging investigators; and (3) Support and expand core facilities."
"9461044","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease that is the result of defective CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion transport function at the cell surface membrane. Individuals suffering this fate can expect to live to their late-thirties. A frequent mutation affecting most CF patients is the F508del mutation found in at least one CF allele at > 80% frequency. This mutant F508del CFTR is a misfolded form of CFTR that is impaired in its ability to traffic to the cytoplasmic apical membrane where it primarily functions as a cAMP-dependent Cl channel, albeit with lowered efficiency. A long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has been identified that is involved in transcriptional regulation of CFTR. Preliminary studies indicate that inhibition of this lncRNA can result in increased expression of mutant CFTR at the cell surface. Therefore, the studies proposed here will test the hypothesis that sustainable expression of mutant CFTR can be achieved in human cells such that there is physiologically and therapeutically efficacious CFTR-associated cAMP-dependent Cl ion transport function present at the apical membrane of epithelial cells. We have developed three aims to test our hypothesis. In aim 1, we will develop and contrast vector and oligonucleotide targeted activation of CFTR, in aim 2, we will characterize the functional components involved in lncRNA modulation of CFTR and in aim 3 we will determine the genome targeting and gene expression profile of these lncRNAs BG213071 and AI805947 in expressing and repressed cells. These studies represent the development of a new therapeutic paradigm for CF, i.e., targeting lncRNAs to affect the function of the protein-coding gene targets that they regulate. In this context, several novel approaches targeted to CFTR-associated lncRNAs will be developed and tested to enhance CFTR expression and function. This new pathway for regulation of CFTR expression by lncRNA could lead to significant insights into those cellular pathways involved in the modulation of CFTR expression during development and in response to secondary infections as well as to the development of a new class of therapeutic agents to treat CF."

"9481350","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the prevalence of HIV in Thailand has been declining recently among the general population, the level remains high among drug users (20%+), MSM (8-22%) and sex workers (7% among direct sex workers and 21% among street walkers). A high proportion of infected individuals in need of treatment (currently set at 350 mm3 CD4 cells) still do not receive treatment, and a high proportion of newly identified individuals already have low CD4 levels. The Thai Ministry of Public Health is now implementing a new strategy, the Area-Based Surveillance System, which will require expanding their research capacity and to generating more accurate strategic information. Through a series of in-country courses and short- and long- term training in advanced research methodologies, the UCLA Department of Epidemiology proposes to assist the Division of Epidemiology of the Thai Ministry of Public Health to achieve the goals of the Area-Based Surveillance System to enhance research capacity. Thus, we propose to train four M.S. candidates, two Ph.D. candidates, and three short-term postdoctoral trainees at UCLA. The degree candidates will conduct their field research for their theses and dissertations in Thailand under the supervision of the Thai faculty members. The short courses to be given in Thailand include strategies for communicating public health messages, strategies for implementing community intervention programs, modeling for disease burden, assessment of intervention strategies, mobile phone and internet technologies for data collection, program monitoring, coordination and supervision of staff, and evidence-based behavioral interventions. Candidates for the UCLA-based programs will be recommended by the Thai faculty on the basis of their academic records, commitment to HIV and public health research, and intention to promote the health of Thais (all of our previous trainees have returned to Thailand)."
"9528444","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Decision making in financial and health matters is of critical importance for maintaining independence and wellbeing in old age, and recent work in predominately older White adults suggests decision making worsens with age. While there is a paucity of knowledge regarding decision making in older Black adults, preliminary studies suggest there may be differences in decision making by race. Decision making can be viewed as a complex interaction of externally influenced contextual factors with two internal systems: a cognitive processing system and an affective processing system. Although racial differences in cognitive processing have been well documented, little is known about racial differences in other components of decision making, and these could have profound economic and public health consequences for a diverse range of older adults. The overall goal of this study is to elucidate racial differences in decision making among older adults and to identify the contextual factors, affective factors, and neurobiological mechanisms that drive them. Contextual factors, such as acquired financial and health literacy, socioeconomic status (SES), and perceived discrimination, vary by race, are often influenced by adverse social and environmental experiences over the life course, and could have important mediating effects between race and decision making. Life course experiences also shape internally modulated affective processes. Since differences in decision making are observed when affective processes interact with cognitive processes, affective factors such as trust, risk aversion, and loneliness could have important moderating effects on decision making by race. Both contextual and affective factors have recently been shown to impact the functional architecture of brain networks, revealing important insights into the neural systems involved in decision making. Regrettably, these findings have been almost exclusively in White persons; thus there is a dearth of knowledge regarding the neural correlates of decision making in Black persons. Racial differences in contextual and affective factors experienced over the life course may result in variability in the organization of functional brain systems. However, it is unknown how or whether any putative differences in functional neural network architecture may drive racial differences in decision making. Finally, Black adults are at greater risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our recent work has implicated poor decision making as a potential risk factor for AD in White adults; however, it is unknown whether and to what extent poor decision making is a risk for AD in Black adults. The proposed study will leverage existing clinical data from nondemented older Blacks and Whites participating in the Minority Aging Research Study (RF1AG022018), the Rush Clinical Core (P3010161), and an ongoing study of decision making in aging (R01AG033678) to collect new behavioral decision making and neuroimaging data among older Black adults. Knowledge of racial differences in decision making and the associated factors that drive them will provide crucial information for identifying potentially modifiable targets for intervention to address health disparities."
"9453363","PROJECT SUMMARY Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a widespread human pathogen that uses latency to remain for life in peripheral nerve ganglia. Reactivation of latent HSV-1 is responsible for a spectrum of diseases but there currently are no effective therapies to eliminate the latent reservoir or prevent reactivation. After decades of study, our understanding of the molecular basis of latency/reactivation and associated pathogenesis remains incomplete. Most studies use live-rodent infection models but these are difficult to manipulate and do not fully recapitulate the properties of HSV-1 infection in humans. Use of primary neuron culture models as an alternative to animals has gained traction in the last ten years, and has provided many important insights into the contribution of host factors that are now guiding further research in animals. The field has matured to a point where we need models using human neurons. This proposal capitalizes on our success in developing a new model of HSV-1 latency in neurons differentiated in vitro from an NIH-approved human embryonic stem cell line. We will use this model to test two important hypotheses that have been very difficult to explore in rodents or rodent-derived neurons. Aim 1 will investigate the impact of preventing expression of the latency- associated non-coding RNAs (LATs) and latency-specific microRNAs. These are expressed at high levels in infected human ganglia but it has been extremely difficult to elucidate their biological roles in rodent models. Aim 2 will reevaluate the contribution of the viral transactivator VP16 to latency and reactivation in the context of human neurons. VP16 is recruited to viral immediate-early (IE) promoters through interaction with the cellular DNA-binding protein Oct-1 (POU2F1). The amino acid sequence of Oct-1 is highly conserved in vertebrates but deviates noticeably in rodents. Substitutions at just two positions on the surface of the rodent Oct-1 POU homeodomain reduces the binding of VP16 to Oct-1 by 100-fold, with an equivalent reduction in VP16-dependent transactivation. To understand the biological consequences of this striking but largely ignored difference, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to exchange just three residues in human Oct-1 in the stem cells to the mouse equivalents (E30D/M33L/D36E), differentiate these into neurons and measure both the efficiency of latency establishment and levels of spontaneous reactivation, a feature of human infections that is missing in murine models. This will test the idea that mismatches in specific molecular interactions can significantly alter the dynamics of the virus-host relationship. Together these studies will provide strong impetus to use in vitro models based on human neurons and develop of improved mouse models that more fully recapitulate the behavior of HSV-1 in it's human host."
"9416697","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder that is typically fatal within three to five years of the appearance of symptoms. The disease is characterized by the progressive loss of the motor nervous system and voluntary muscle function without great effect on central or sensory neural function. For this reason, afflicted individuals effectively become prisoners within their own bodies before succumbing to respiratory paralysis. To date, there is no truly effective means to slow or reverse the progression of ALS. While motoneuron death is the most recognized characteristic of ALS, the molecular events that underlie ALS are not restricted to the nervous system. A more accurate description of ALS pathology is that paralysis occurs as a result of motor unit loss. In this regard, the fidelity of the fragile connections between motoneurons and skeletal muscle (neuromuscular junctions) is dependent not only on neuronal input but also on the integrity of the effector muscle. Thus, the long-term goal of this research is to understand how skeletal muscle dysfunction contributes to the destabilization of neuromuscular junctions and motoneuron death in multiple forms of ALS. In the defined duration of this proposal, a role for the monomeric G protein Rad (Ras- related Associated with Diabetes) in ALS pathogenesis will be investigated. Rad is of particular interest because: 1) Rad expression is enhanced just prior to presentation of symptoms in muscle of sporadic ALS patients and two established familial ALS mouse models (SOD1G93A and SOD1G86R), 2) Rad is a potent inhibitor of skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channels (CaV1.1), and 3) chronic upregulation of Rad causes marked muscle atrophy. Preliminary data also indicate that the two physiological functions of CaV1.1 - L-type Ca2+ channel and voltage-sensor for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling - are progressively impaired in muscle of mice globally expressing SOD1G93A and in mice in which SOD1G93A expression has been restricted to skeletal muscle. Aim 1 will determine whether chronic upregulation of Rad in muscle can cause NMJ destabilization and subsequent motoneuron death. In these experiments, the impact of AAV1-mediated, muscle-specific Rad overexpression on motoneuron viability will be assessed longitudinally using a combination of immunohistological and electrophysiological methods. In Aim 2, a Rad null-SOD1G93A mouse line will be created in order to reveal the direct involvement of Rad in promoting muscle atrophy, NMJ destabilization and motoneuron death. Gross, locomotor, histological, ultrastructural and electrophysiological techniques will then be employed to determine whether genetic ablation of Rad can limit the deleterious effects of SOD1G93A on muscle integrity and motoneuron viability. Using qRT-PCR, immunoblotting and patch-clamp electrophysiology, Aim 3 will test whether enhanced Rad expression and depression of CaV1.1 function are common to multiple forms of ALS."
"9534483","Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop computational pipelines that allow in silico prediction of functional genetic variants that disrupt pre-mRNA splicing and related pathways in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in AD genomes of various patient cohorts. The next great challenge is to identify causal variants and elucidate their potential function relevant to disease processes. To this end, research efforts have been directed to studying variants located in protein-coding, promoter, and splice site regions due to their apparent impacts on gene expression. However, many of the newly identified disease-associated variants reside in other non-coding regions, such as introns, that may confer regulatory function to the related gene. The mechanisms of these variants have been hard to decipher. It is expected that many of them may function at the post-transcriptional level, thus affecting mRNA expression. In human, a myriad of processes mediate RNA expression at the post-transcriptional stage, one of which being splicing. Splicing is an essential step of mammalian gene expression and alternative splicing affects most human genes. Recent literature reported that RNA splicing is a primary link between GVs and disease. In general, it was estimated that 15-60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In AD, aberrant splicing has been detected in many functionally critical genes, some of which are modulated by GVs. Despite the importance, how to accurately identify functional genetic variants in splicing regulation remains a key question in the field. To address this question, the large collection of RNA-Seq and genotyping data sets collected from AD and control subjects represent an invaluable resource. We will develop and apply novel methodologies to make full use of these data sets, complemented by further bioinformatic prediction and experimental validations. This work will allow a previously unattained level of understanding of genetic variants in splicing regulation and provide new means to tackle the imperative task of functional annotations of genetic variants in AD."
"9521742","The role of modifiable risk factors (RF), like physical activity (PA), sleep quality, social engagement, and cardiovascular (CV) risk is receiving greater attention to promote the cognitive health of an aging population and reduce risk of Alzheimer's disease. Each of these risk factors is known to be influenced by environmental sources, such as neighborhood walkability, safety, noise, and access to low-cost transportation, retail, and healthy food sources. However, little is known about the role of neighborhood factors as drivers of cognitive aging and risk for Alzheimer's disease. If neighborhood matters, adaptations in the use of available infrastructures have the potential to impact thousands at a time. Those neighborhood factors that most impact individual RF and cognitive health to reduce Alzheimer's disease risk may further differ by race and sex. Evaluating the role of neighborhood characteristics on cognitive health is difficult to interpret from more widely used cross-sectional data due to residual confounding. Therefore, investigating how residentially stable older adults are affected by their local stable and changing contexts and how older adults who relocate to a new neighborhood may respond to their new context by changing health behaviors requires long-term study during the last 1/3 of life years prior to the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) represents an ideal cohort for studying interactions between individual health and neighborhood risk factors for various reasons. First, participants were well characterized for key modifiable RF, above, as well as cognition, and mobility. Second, the cohort is nationally representative, bi-racial and spans socioeconomically diverse, urban and rural neighborhoods, allowing us to examine the relation between individual risk and variability in neighborhood factors. Third, our proposal seeks to address the research challenges and opportunities articulated in the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework by examining interactions between environment, biology and behavior. We hypothesize that long-term exposure to neighborhood disadvantage may serve as a common cause of individual risk factors and neurocognitive and functional health, particularly in socio-demographically at-risk groups. Specific aims are to characterize associations between long-term neighborhood exposures and: 1) individual rates of decline and impairment in cognition and physical function; 2) individual risk factors (PA, sleep quality, social engagement and CV burden) for Alzheimer's disease, which may mediate neighborhood differences in cognitive and functional risk, and; 3) whether specific neighborhood exposures account for racial and sex differences in cognitive and functional risk. Addressing these questions in the CHS provides an unmatched opportunity to examine the influence of a range of neighborhood factors on long-term trajectories of cognitive and functional aging prior to the onset of Alzheimer's disease. This work will inform future design of multi-level approaches to target those neighborhood factors impacting multiple RF to optimize healthful activity, reduce health disparities, and help adults remain active and age in place. 1"
"9521566","PROJECT SUMMARY Children are exposed to multiple environmental hazards?toxic chemicals, social stressors, and the hazards of the built environment. Research indicates that early-life environmental exposures contribute to common pediatric diseases (asthma, learning disorders, birth defects, obesity) and to diseases in adult life. Yet few pediatricians are trained to diagnose, treat, or prevent diseases of environmental origin, and few academic health centers have research programs in environmental pediatrics. The IOM states that there is a national need to expand the scientific workforce in environmental medicine, and new NIH initiatives (CHEAR and ECHO) have emphasized that children's environmental health is a research priority. Thus, there is a clear need for scientists trained in the principles and methodologies of environmental pediatrics. To address that need, the Mount Sinai School of Medicine seeks renewal of its 3-year, interdisciplinary, post-residency/post-doctoral research training program in environmental pediatrics that began in 2007. Two new fellows are admitted per year. Selection is highly competitive, and fellows are a mix of clinically trained pediatricians and doctorally trained research scientists. In year 1, focus is on education training in epidemiology, biostatistics, toxicology, and environmental medicine, and an MPH degree is granted concentrating in epidemiology. In years 2 and 3, emphasis shifts more toward mentored research that produces publications, meeting presentations/posters, and fosters transition toward independent research with an emphasis on K award applications. We provide fellows with a strong methodological base in environmental health principles and a versatile set of skills and resources that they can apply to study a wide range of scientific questions. Each fellow is guided by a mentoring team of clinical and basic scientists. Courses and experiential training are provided in grant writing and responsible conduct of research. Supervised clinical experience in environmental pediatrics is offered to ensure that research training is grounded in clinical translational principles. Formal evaluation of each fellow is conducted semi-annually. An Executive Faculty Committee and an External Advisory Board are already in place. Expected outcomes include authorship of 1-2 research manuscripts, authorship of 2-3 posters or platforms at national meetings, development in year 2 of a K grant proposal, and evidence of transition toward independent investigator status. This program builds on a unique base of children's environmental health research, including a Child Health Exposure Assessment Resource (CHEAR) Lab Hub, the CHEAR Data Center, an NIH P30 Core Center, nearly a dozen child health research cohorts, a Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit, and a unique Exposome Lab that specializes in exposure biomarkers. In the past 9 years, our program has successfully recruited 19 fellows and graduated 12 (6 are active). Five have secured NIH funding. Graduates are currently faculty UC-Davis, NYU, U of Cincinnati, Mount Sinai, as well as working at CDC and for Industry. Our graduates have published over 70 papers in 9 years."
"9471433","Project summary: Psychosis is typically identified in adolescence or early adulthood and can cause chronic impairment throughout life. Duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is one modifiable factor that predicts clinical and functional outcomes. Shorter duration of untreated psychosis has been associated with a host of positive outcomes. Despite this knowledge, DUP in the United States is too long. Prior efforts to reduce DUP have met with only modest results, possibly because outreach efforts have targeted the wrong stakeholder groups. Social workers constitute the majority of the human services and mental health workforce and represent a segment of the workforce likely to have direct contact with people in the early phases of psychosis. Therefore, social workers would be an ideal group to engage towards the goal of reducing DUP. In the context of a randomized controlled trial, in partnership between the Maryland Early Intervention Program (a network of specialty clinics for early psychosis) and the University of Maryland School of Social Work, we propose to administer an innovative online training program that emphasizes screening implementation to a large network of over 1,200 clinical social workers. The project is designed to increase awareness of early psychosis among social workers and to thereby facilitate rapid access to specialty care for their clients who may be experiencing first episode psychosis, circumventing the extended DUP that is characteristic of current treatment as usual. We expect at least 300 new referrals for early psychosis treatment through this intervention, which would give us sufficient statistical power to detect improvements in DUP, referral rate, and referral validity. The proposed intervention will take advantage of the research team's access to social workers across the state, as well as an expertise in psychosis screening, to systematically test training and screening methods intended to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis in our community."
"9482367","Project Summary/Abstract Hypertension, a primary risk factor for stroke, causes artery remodeling which leads to impairments in autoregulation of blood flow and impaired neuronal function. The mechanisms by which artery remodeling and impaired autoregulation occur with hypertension remain unknown. Elevated aldosterone levels and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation have been linked to vascular damage in hypertension, and stroke. In rat models of hypertension, MR antagonism prevents hypertensive artery remodeling, but the mechanisms of action and the specific cell types involved in the process have not been identified because MR antagonists inhibit the actions of aldosterone in all cell types in the arteries. Endothelial MR signaling in peripheral arteries plays a critical role in cardiovascular injury. The endothelial MRs regulate vasodilation in peripheral arteries through calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channels, in particular, small conductance (SKCa) and intermediate conductance (IKCa) channels. These channels can be activated by calcium (Ca2+) influx through transient receptor potential (TRP) channels such as the A1 and V4. The endothelial cells in cerebral arteries expressing MRs are anatomically unique which prevents us from extrapolating the findings in the periphery to the brain. The proposed studies will assess, for the first time, how MR activation regulates endothelial cell Ca2+ homeostasis through SKCa/IKCa, TRPA1 and TRPV4 channels in the cerebral microcirculation. We will address these problems by utilizing endothelial cell specific MR knockout (ECMRKO) mice as a tool to evaluate the role of endothelial MR activation in calcium (Ca2+)-mediated endothelial dysfunction in the cerebral microcirculation during hypertension. We hypothesize that hypertension will result in changes in endothelial Ca2+ signaling that will impair endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the parenchymal arterioles. Furthermore, we propose that endothelial cell deletion of the MR in hypertensive mice will prevent impaired Ca2+ mediated endothelium- dependent dilation. We will focus on the effects of endothelial MR activation on hypertensive cerebral artery function; however, our findings could have wide reaching implications for stroke and vascular dementia."
"9541004","Project Summary  Emotional dysfunction is at the core of many psychiatric disorders, including fear, anxiety, post-traumatic, and mood disorders. Thus, describing the neural mechanisms associated with emotional processing is a critical issue in mental health care. One important aspect of emotional dysfunction is the maladaptive deployment of attention to locations or features that contain potentially threatening information. In social anxiety, greater distress has been associated with findings of hypervigilance (more attention to threat cues) but also with perceptual avoidance of threat cues. The present project aims to address these conflicting results by characterizing the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying attention deployment in social anxiety. As a comparison, we will compare those with social phobia to a group with a snake phobia, as those with a snake phobia typically present hypervigilance without oculomotor avoidance, unlike those with social phobia. Previous attempts to define the neurophysiology of social threat perception have been hampered by the unavailability of conceptual and methodological frameworks for studying threat cue perception in complex scenes. The proposed research establishes a novel technique for combining electrophysiological recordings, high in temporal precision, with eye movement recordings. This approach, called steady-state potential frequency-tagging, is unique in that it allows researchers to identify distinct visual-cortical processes selectively activated by specific elements of a complex visual scene?even when the elements are spatially overlapping. We combine this innovative approach with a novel conceptual framework that considers changes in visual perception an active part of an observer's emotional response, to address the following Aims: We first define the visual cortical dynamics related to exploratory saccades (i.e., oculomotor-cortical coupling) in a free viewing situation, comparing saccades to threat cues (face pairs and naturalistic scenes) with saccades to neutral cues. Then we compare how individuals high and low in self-reported social anxiety different in these indices of attention deployment. Pursuing these aims allows us to address a long-standing controversy in the literature, and more importantly will define the neural mechanisms mediating dysfunctional attention biases in social anxiety. Such mechanistic knowledge is needed in the context of current efforts towards improving diagnostic assessment and identifying specific treatment targets for mental health problems."
"9480879","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is associated with poor asthma control and greater healthcare utilization and costs. Early evidence suggests that obesity, especially among those with late onset asthma (>age 12 years), worsens asthma by promoting oxidative stress in the airway, a consequence of reduced L-arginine and increased asymmetric di- methyl arginine (ADMA) in the nitric oxide (NO) metabolic pathway. This mechanism coexists with the better characterized TH-2 mediated inflammatory pathways, which are the target of most chronic asthma therapeutics. The relative contribution of the L-arginine/ADMA to asthma activity in obese adults is understudied and evaluation is needed to determine asthma endotypes and whether L-arginine/ADMA is a suitable focus for new treatments for obese asthmatics. But biological pathways are only part of the drivers of asthma morbidity. Self-management behaviors (SMB), like medication adherence, are a key to asthma control and weight management, and in obese asthmatics an array of potentially conflicting perceptions and beliefs may impede self-management of each. Further complicating this picture, cognitive functioning can be impaired by obesity, adding another impediment to SMB. Most research on SMB and health outcomes focuses on single illnesses, ignoring the interrelationships that likely exist between the beliefs, behaviors, and biology that influence coexisting medical conditions. Major advances in care of people with multiple chronic medical conditions, such as obesity and asthma, will occur through strategies that consider how comorbidities interact on all these levels. Our goal is to move toward this end by examining the interaction of biology and behavior among obese asthmatics and ultimately improve their care. The Specific Aims are to: (1) compare the longitudinal relationship between L-arginine/ADMA balance and morbidity (lung function, asthma control, acute resource utilization, and quality of life) between obese adults with late onset asthma vs. (a) obese adults with early onset asthma and non-obese asthmatics with early (b) or late (c) onset disease; (2) evaluate the interrelationship between obesity- and asthma-related illness beliefs, and the impact of cognitive function, on patients' management of these conditions over time; (3) develop and pilot test three theory-based modules that integrate counseling for asthma and obesity to promote better SMB, including self-monitoring, adherence to asthma medications, and lifestyle changes for weight loss. We will recruit 400 obese and non-obese adult asthmatics in New York City and Pittsburgh and assess L-arginase, ADMA, and markers of TH-2 activity, asthma and obesity illness beliefs and SMB, cognition, and asthma morbidity every 6 months over 18 months and after asthma exacerbations. For Aim 3, we will develop and test the integrated education and counseling modules, guided by the Self-regulation Model, on 80 obese asthmatics for feasibility and preliminary impact to inform a future, comprehensive program of self-management support."

"9516843","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cross-country comparisons of population health remain a substantial challenge even using objectively measured biological health markers. This project will have a significant and sustained impact on addressing this key scientific and policy challenge. This application addresses the top 3 recommendations from a recent National Academy of Science review that highlighted the surprisingly poor US health outcomes as compared with those of most other major developed countries : (1) improve the quality and consistency of data sources available for cross-national health comparisons (Aim 3), (2) refine analytic methods and study designs for cross-national health research (Aims 3-5) and (3) initiate research devoted to understanding factors responsible for the US health disadvantage (Aims 1 & 2). We propose to harmonize the growing body of biomarker data from a number of developed and developing countries to increase the source of information on health differences in these increasingly important contributors to world economic, aging and health trends. Crucially, to accomplish our aims, we will implement critically needed cross-calibration of country-specific biomarker data to allow for direct comparative research based on objectively measured health parameters. This will move comparative health research beyond prior efforts that were largely restricted to available mortality or self-report data. The proposed aims of this R01 will result in harmonization of objectively measured biomarker data for population-based samples of adults in 19 developed and developing countries. Biomarkers included in the current analyses (C-reactive protein [CRP], glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c], HDL and total cholesterol) reflect major pathophysiological processes linked to major causes of morbidity and mortality. Specific aims of the current project include: implementing cross-calibration/harmonization of biomarker data for 11 major population-based health surveys representing 19 countries; documenting and disseminating methods to produce harmonized biomarker data for use by the broader research community; and illustrating the impact of calibration by describing and comparing cross-national differences in key biological risk profiles based on raw and calibrated data and describing and comparing cross-national differences in relationships between key demographic and socio-economic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, education, economic resources) and distributions of the 4 biological parameters based on raw vs. calibrated biomarkers. Proposed aims will result in a set of publicly available, cross-calibrated data on HbA1c, lipids and CRP for 11 major population health surveys representing 19 countries along with findings from analyses leveraging those data that address questions relating to both the relative health status of the US and relationships between economic development and health."
"9459823","PROJECT SUMMARY Previous work under this P01 has demonstrated that a single treatment with the mitochondrial targeted peptide SS-31 improves skeletal muscle performance, mitochondrial function, and reduces redox stress. These surprising results demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction with age is a more dynamic process than previously thought and can be reversed by late-life treatment to improve healthspan. This new paradigm led directly to an ongoing clinical trial at the University of Washington led by Kevin Conley (PL-Core B) testing SS- 31 for improvement in skeletal muscle function in elderly humans. Preliminary data presented in this renewal also demonstrates that relatively short term treatment (4-8 weeks) with SS-31 can improve cardiac and skeletal muscle function and vision in aged rodents. Additional data from our lab, Core E, and others indicates that SS- 31 does not act as a traditional antioxidant by scavenging reactive oxygen species. Instead there is growing evidence that SS-31 interacts with mitochondrial cardiolipin to improve mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS) function and reduce mitochondrial oxidative stress. We propose that improved ETS function with short- term treatment reduces redox and energy stress which improves function and stress response of the aged muscle. With long-term treatment this improved stress signaling restores mitochondrial structure leading to further improvements in mitochondrial and skeletal muscle performance. Aim 1 uses normal aging and an ETS targeted toxin, doxorubicin, to test this hypothesis for the reversal of age-related muscle dysfunction. We assess the effect of 1 day, 1 week, and 8 week SS-31 treatment on the reversal of mitochondrial redox and energy stress, stress signaling regulating mitochondrial quality, and skeletal muscle performance. For short- term effects we will focus on targeted analyses of the thiol and phospho proteomes in key stress response and functional pathways. We have found that reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress reverses many of the age- related oxidative changes to the thiol proteome, including proteins involved in muscle contraction, EC coupling, protein quality control, and mitochondrial energetics. Aim 2 uses SOD1-/- mice to test whether protection of mitochondrial ETS function and reducing redox stress with SS-31 in this model of accelerated sarcopenia can prevent muscle atrophy when treatment is initiated at the onset of muscle dysfunction. Aim 3 is shared across projects and tests whether SS-31 treatment initiated at mid-life preserves healthspan in normal aging and in aging compounded by high fat diet. Many of the mechanisms tested in Project 2 are likely to be relevant to the aging heart (Project 1) and visual system (Project 3) as well. Therefore the parallel work in these three systems, in which we have already identified significant reversal of physiological decline with SS-31, provides the unique opportunity to identify aspects of mitochondrial function that contribute to the basic biology of aging across diverse physiological systems. The end result will be new insights into the mechanistic basis of this new paradigm for improving healthspan with potential for direct translation to elderly humans."
"9623663","Project Summary/Abstract: Our recent work showed that triggering the anti-oxidant master regulator Nrf2, in macrophages, establishes an antiviral state in those cells that blocks HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection as well as infection by animal viruses FIV and MVV. Investigating the impact of the block on HIV-1, we found that it is manifest after reverse transcription, likely before the viral DNA enters the cell nucleus. Nrf2 regulates upward of one hundred genes. Our work to determine which of these blocks infection revealed that one, a cell surface protein that regulates the intracellular oxidative state by importing cystine, also contributes to determining the infectability of macrophages. Interestingly, we found that this protein and the block are already partially active in macrophages, thus allowing both up-and down-regulate the antiviral effects. How this cell surface protein blocks a virus infection step within the cell is not known. The long-term goal of our work is to better understand cellular defenses against viral infection so that they can be controlled therapeutically to benefit the host. The overall objective of the work proposed in this application is to determine whether xCT acts alone to block HIV or whether it is a part of a more complex anti-viral pathway. Our central hypothesis is that xCT blocks nuclear import of the viral pre-integration complex by acting directly on the virus, perhaps by trapping it at the cytoplasmic membrane after entry. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the role of xCT in the Nrf2-regulated restriction will direct our subsequent research into how the block works. Knowing how xCT contributes to hindering retrovirus infection will help to reveal how this mechanism can be exploited in either myeloid-specific or universal antiviral strategies. Our hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) To determine whether xCT alone is sufficient to block macrophage infection, (2) To test whether the amino acid transporter function of xCT is required for the Nrf2-triggered infection block and (3) To identify where in the cell the viral components are blocked. Since it?s not clear how a cell surface protein acts to cause an apparent nuclear import block, our approach is to test whether xCT acts directly, or indirectly through its normal function, and where in the cell this impacts the virus. We believe that the work proposed in this application is innovative because it will offer the opportunity to refocus the study of host-antiviral factors to include a new, exogenously inducible, restriction pathway. This contribution will be significant because it is expected to offer a new pathway for retrovirus control that can be externally up- or down-regulated in macrophages and possibly in related cell types like DCs and microglia."
"9480843","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been increasing 3-5% per year for decades, most rapidly in the very young. A prevention strategy is essential to alleviate the tremendous personal and public health burden of diabetes and will likely also influence strategies to cure or reverse the disease in those already afflicted. As the only new Clinical Center admitted to the TrialNet consortium in 2009, Vanderbilt University has an extremely strong record of participant recruitment and engagement and is well-positioned among Clinical Centers to continue to make a difference in the success of TrialNet. Our center brings abundant resources for the work proposed. We have a very large and carefully followed T1D patient and family base from which to continue to draw participants. We have gained substantial community involvement and endorsement of our efforts and have a very strong record of participant engagement and retention in clinical trials, currently being the leading recruitment site for the two ongoing prevention trials that were initiated since our entry. We have developed a widely distributed and enthusiastic group of 14 Affiliates, well supported by our Center, to bring TrialNet to a broad spectrum of small communities and metropolitan areas throughout the US. Our experience will allow us to take advantage of opportunities to add new affiliates and expand and enhance the activities of underperforming affiliates. We propose novel directions to further our reach: an extension of our Center's presence to multiple autoimmune patient communities at the local and national levels, a hitherto underutilized reservoir of T1D families eligible for screening. We have developed a partnership with the Tennessee Department of Health to bring TrialNet into all public health centers of the state of Tennessee, which if successful, could be a network model for outreach in other states. The media outreach of our center has been extensive and we propose an expanded national and international media presence that will continue to benefit the entire network. We document the leadership roles that our PI and coordinators have had at the network level in the development and execution of new prevention studies, in public relations, in affiliate management and engagement, and in study coordination. We document strong institutional support of our application by both the Vanderbilt Diabetes Center and the Department of Pediatrics in ways that amplify the financial investment by the NIDDK. Vanderbilt University will support any options the network endorses to expedite IRB approval of studies. Finally, we demonstrate a strong pool of early stage investigators whose careers have already been influenced by TrialNet at Vanderbilt. We outline a plan to more vigorously engage them intellectually and scientifically in the work of the network while furthering their careers. Using this broad and diverse set of TrialNet-inspired resources, the TrialNet Clinical Center at Vanderbilt is well positioned to be a leader in T1D prevention and in improving the lives of people with T1D throughout the world."
"9481847","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Diamond Blackfan Anemia Registry (DBAR) is a comprehensive database of patients with the rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA). DBA is a heterogeneous genetic disorder characterized by pure red cell aplasia, congenital anomalies and a predisposition to cancer. Anemia usually presents in infancy or early childhood and approximately 50% of patients have at least one congenital anomaly. The overall cumulative incidence of cancer is over 20% by age 46, with some individual cancer risks such as colon carcinoma and osteogenic sarcoma elevated more than 30-fold compared to the general population. To date, 11 genes encoding ribosomal proteins of both the small and large subunits have been found to be mutated, representing nearly 70% of patients with DBA. Affected individuals within the same family vary dramatically as to the degree of anemia, response to corticosteroids, the presence of congenital anomalies, and the development of cancer. Prior to the development of the DBAR, our knowledge regarding the epidemiology and response to various treatment modalities was determined exclusively from literature reports. The DBAR was developed in order to provide a well-characterized patient substrate linked to biological samples, permitting the study of the epidemiology and biology of DBA. The objective of this proposal is to continue to improve and exploit the DBAR in order to:  1) facilitate investigations into the epidemiology and biology of DBA  2) provide an accurate phenotype of DBA patients to facilitate genotype-phenotype  correlations as new genes are discovered  3) provide well-characterized patients access to treatment protocols  4) provide patients and their health care providers access to research studies  5) provide patients and their health care providers with results of research studies  6) serve as a resource to patients and their doctors to guide diagnostic, therapeutic,  and reproductive decisions  7) develop an accurate, rapid diagnostic test for DBA  8) utilize the DBAR infrastructure and patient data to develop and manage clinical trials  9) solicit national and international collaborative research"
"9699093","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although marijuana is considered a controlled substance, cannabis research and the medical use of cannabis have shown significant promise for the treatment of numerous medical problems. Studies have demonstrated that exocannabinoids, THC and synthetic cannabinoids, including Spice, interfere with the functions of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) present in the brain and required for neurogenesis. However, during cannabinoid abuse, significant impairments in neurocognitive and behavioral functions are evident and these effects are exacerbated in subjects with symptomatic HIV infection. The establishment of HIV latency in brain is supported by the inability of HIV drugs to cross BBB. In recent years, use of nanotechnology in medicine has shown exiting prospect for development of novel drug delivery systems. However, the existing technology suffers from lack of adequate transendothelial penetration as well as the uncertainty of drug release from the carrier if and when the nanocarrier reaches the brain. So from a drug delivery point of view, a fast and effective way of delivering and releasing latency-breaking agent, HIV drugs, and mAEA from the carrier in the brain is very much needed to eradicate HIV reservoir and to prevent exocannabinoid-induced neuronal impairments in HIV infected cannabinoid users. In the current proposal, we will examine the role of the blood brain barrier (BBB) impenetrable tenofovir, the stable endocannabinoid analog methanandamide (mAEA) to prevent the exocannabinoid- induced neuronal deficits using multifunctional nanocarrier bound mAEA delivery across the BBB using the in vitro BBB and in vivo HIVE SCID cannabinoid mouse model. Our recently published manuscript in Nature Communication describes magneto-electric nanoparticles (MENPs) as field triggered drug carriers offer an unique capability of low energy and dissipation free on-demand drug release across BBB. Our preliminary studies in CNS cells showed that vorinostat activates latently HIV-infected astrocytes, mAEA upregulates synaptic plasticity genes, mAEA down-regulates HIV-induced inflammatory molecules, and significantly down-regulates p24 levels. Accordingly in specific aim 1, we will develop and evaluate the transport, delivery, release on demand and efficacy of nanoformulations containing Vorinostat (VS), Tenofovir (Tef), and mAEA respectively to activate latent HIV infection, eradicate HIV and protect from HIV/cannabiniod induced neuronal deficits using an in-vitro BBB-HIV infection cannabinoid model. In specific aim 2, we will evaluate the in vivo efficacy of the developed nanocarrier in HIVE SCID cannabinoid mouse model, and in specific aim 3, the neurobehavioral modulations induced by nanoformulation in HIVE SCID cannabinoid mouse model will be studied. We expect that the unprecedented new 3-D technology could be of high significance in diagnostics and drug delivery. This multidisciplinary new break-through in specific drug targeting to the brain using MENPs is in response to PA-13-302 and will be useful for reactivation of latent HIV and final eradication of HIV from CNS reservoir and to treat cannabinoid-induced neuronal impairments in HIV subjects."
"9436860","ABSTRACT Staphylococcus aureus in an important bacterial pathogen that provokes a diverse range of infections, ranging from localized skin and soft tissue infections to invasive, life-threatening diseases, such as bacteremia, endocarditis, and necrotizing pneumonia. Acquisition of antibiotic resistance has made treatment of staphylococcal infections challenging. Development of an effective vaccine to prevent invasive diseases caused by S. aureus remains a healthcare priority, but success has been elusive as evidenced by four failed phase III clinical trials in humans. Recent studies have suggested that a vaccine that targets multiple bacterial antigens may prove to be the best strategy for producing broad and effective protection against S. aureus disease. The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe and effective S. aureus vaccine that stimulates a robust antibody and T cell response in the host. S. aureus has recently been shown to produce nano-sized, non-living extracellular vesicles (EVs) both in vitro and in vivo. These membrane-bound vesicles package multiple staphylococcal antigens, including those that are cytoplasmic, membrane-associated, and secreted in the parental strain, making it feasible to generate designer EVs as a multivalent vaccine platform. Moreover, EVs are enriched for lipoproteins that serve to enhance EV immunogenicity, and this may abrogate the need for administration with an adjuvant. A limitation of this vaccine approach is that S. aureus EVs also contain native toxins and immune evasion factors like staphylococcal protein A that can harm the host and dampen the antibody response. The hypothesis of the proposal is that genetically engineered S. aureus cells can be utilized to produce EVs that are safe, immunogenic, and elicit a protective immune response in the host. To address this, an accessory gene regulator and protein A double mutant (?agr?spa) of USA300 S. aureus strain JE2 was constructed. EVs prepared from the mutant strain were nontoxic, immunogenic, and elicited protective efficacy in a mouse sepsis model. Engineered EVs (eng-EVs) were generated that also package nontoxic alpha toxin and a leukocidin subunit. Mice immunized with the eng-EVs produced both binding and toxin neutralizing serum antibodies. The specific aims of this R21 application are to: 1) Characterize and further modify S. aureus extracellular vesicles to contain additional protective antigens. 2) Evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of second-generation engineered EVs in murine models of S. aureus infection. The humoral and T cell responses of immunized mice will be measured, and the animals will be challenged with diverse S. aureus strains in models of sepsis and surgical wound infection. At the conclusion of these studies, creation of a novel genetically engineered EV vaccine platform will be accomplished, and these eng-EVs will be tested for protective efficacy as a multivalent vaccine for the prevention of S. aureus infections. These studies may also allow the identification of previously unknown S. aureus protective antigens."
"9536626","PROJECT SUMMARY Dietary restriction (DR), the reduction in nutrient intake without malnutrition, has been well documented as a means to extend lifespan and slow age-related diseases in many systems. Because dietary restriction is not easily implemented in humans, the molecules underlying its effects are urgently sought as targets of aging therapeutics. How do we discover these dietary restriction response genes? Against the backdrop of powerful candidate-gene studies by many groups, including ours, a systems-level understanding of dietary restriction in metazoans has been elusive, owing to the dearth of genome-scale screening methods available to date. Furthermore, studies from worms and mice have demonstrated that healthspan measures do not necessarily correlate with lifespan thus arguing whether the lifespan extension of certain nutrient-responsive pathways will necessarily translate to extend healthspan in humans. We propose to meet this challenge with an unbiased screen for genes that mediate the effects of DR on lifespan and healthspan, harnessing the natural genetic variation present in wild outbred individuals. Variation in longevity in wild isolates of flies and mice upon changes in the diet has been shown before but without identifying any associated genes. We propose genetic dissection of the effects of DR on lifespan and age-related decline in mobility in a system that allows expedient confirmation of screen hits. Drosophila melanogaster is the metazoan of choice for this analysis of natural genetic variation, particularly with the advent of sets of wild, genotyped lines for gene mapping by genome-wide association. Our preliminary data make clear that a) effects of DR on lifespan and healthspan differ across different strains of wild flies, b) the effects of DR on healthspan and lifespan are not correlated and c) we can uncover genes necessary for diet-dependent changes in lifespan and healthspan using this approach. We propose the following aims to discover and characterize genes that underlie this variation: (1) we will identify candidate genes that explain the underlying differences between wild strains in lifespan and age-related climbing ability upon DR; (2) we will test candidate genes identified to mediate the genetic basis of differences in lifespan and age-related climbing ability under different diets and (3) we will characterize the potential mechanisms by which some of the identified genes extend healthspan and lifespan and the relationship between these two traits. With the completion of these Aims, we will have enabled the discovery of nucleotides, genes, and pathways by which dietary restriction affects lifespan and healthspan, and the relationship between the two in the fly. These molecules will open up the potential for long-term studies in the field by providing novel targets for healthspan and lifespan extension in mammals."
"9523600","PROJECT SUMMARY: Difficulty incorporating the weaker arm in everyday activities significantly contributes to impaired function and quality of life after stroke. Most prevalent rehabilitation approaches that focus on improving the unimanual performance of the weaker arm have had limited impact on weaker arm use and integration in the real world. In contrast to the unimanual focus of rehabilitation approaches, most tasks of daily living engage both arms in a highly coordinated and interactive manner. After unilateral stroke, the interactive coordination between the two arms is significantly impaired, even in patients with mild unimanual deficits, and is seldom remediated by unimanual training. Impaired bimanual coordination may greatly limit the integration of the weaker arm in daily activities, most of which are bimanual. Therefore, targeted training of bimanual coordination is necessary to achieve a more complete functional arm recovery. Designing effective training however requires a clear characterization of the fundamental deficits in how stroke survivors coordinate their arms, and how task demands influence that coordination. Further, to move in the direction of more definitive clinical investigations of bimanual training, it is important to identify factors that help explain individual variability in bimanual coordination after stroke. The proposed studies will determine: (a) how motor and perceptual task demands of a bimanual reaching task interact to influence coordination between arms in stroke survivors compared to age- matched controls, (b) the immediate effects of changing perceptual and motor task demands on bimanual coordination in stroke survivors and (c) the behavioral, neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic contributors to individual differences in bimanual coordination after stroke. The approach is strong in that it aims to determine the fundamental nature of bimanual control deficit(s) after stroke and then tests specific strategies to target the underlying deficit(s). Particularly innovative is the manipulation of perceptual task demands in a virtual environment to influence coordination between hands. Also, multimodal investigation to identify the contribution of lesion and neural connectivity to bimanual coordination in stroke survivors is novel. The proposed project is significant because it will provide fundamental understanding of brain-behavior relationship for bimanual coordination after stroke. This will advance the science of rehabilitation with a stronger clinical impact. For instance, identifying which patients have impaired bimanual coordination and who show improvements with perceptual cueing will provide crucial information for testing evidence-based targeted training of bimanual coordination in future studies. The results from this project will set the stage for future investigations aimed at the development of intervention protocols to improve bimanual coordination necessary for more complete functional arm recovery after stroke. Finally, this proposal takes us closer to achievement of the NIH mission to reduce the burden of neurological disorders and enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities."

"9418743","Project Description/Abstract. Trypanosomatids are parasites that cause debilitating and often fatal diseases in humans and livestock. A particularly serious problem in sub-Saharan Africa is caused by Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite spread by the bite of an infected Tsetse fly. T. brucei causes disease by proliferating in the blood, tissue spaces, and eventually the central nervous system of its mammalian host. Related parasites are equally important to human populations in other parts of the world, including South and Central America, Southeastern Asia and the Middle East. Our long-term goal is to understand, in biochemical and genetic detail, the mechanisms that coordinate gene expression in trypanosomatids. To achieve this goal, we are specifically investigating the mechanism used by the parasites to regulate their mRNA expression pattern. mRNA expression gives rise to a characteristic and essential proteome and determines the metabolic capabilities of the parasites. As a pathway into understanding mRNA expression control, we are studying a novel RNA-binding protein, RBP42, which was chosen for investigation because it (1) is essential for parasite proliferation and (2) binds to polysome-associated, translating mRNAs that encode a variety of enzymes and proteins within the cell's energy metabolic pathways and (3) is up-regulated in adipose tissue-dwelling parasites compared to bloodstream-dwelling parasites in the mouse model of infection. These data suggest that RBP42 is a key regulator of the parasite's nutritional homeostasis by influencing mRNA translation/ stability/sequestration as parasites flourish in the bloodstream, interstitial regions and central nervous system of their mammalian host.  This exploratory, two-year project is grounded in preliminary and published data, and is strengthened by the complementary expertise of our group, revealing RBP42's role in parasite energy metabolism in the tissue culture model, and the Nagajyothi group, revealing parasite-host metabolic homeostasis in adipose tissue in the mouse model of infection. Our aims are to explore the spatiotemporal expression of RBP42, and determine its mRNA targeting function, in T. brucei during the dynamics of host infection."

"9473814","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fifty percent of Medicaid patients treated on hospital psychiatric units fail to attend a follow-up outpatient service within 30 days of discharge. These failed care transitions increase the risk of relapse, readmission, criminal justice involvement, and suicide. Hospital care transition practices meant to facilitate transitions include communicating with outpatient mental health providers, scheduling timely post-discharge outpatient appointments, and forwarding treatment summaries to outpatient providers. These practices represent a standard of care and are included in many new public reporting and pay-for-performance programs. However, surprisingly little is known about how often hospital providers complete these practices, which practices are more critical than others, and for which patients these practices may not be sufficient to ensure follow-up. The proposed project addresses these questions by examining hospital care transition practices for over 30,000 Medicaid discharges from more than 100 hospital psychiatric units throughout New York State (NYS) in 2012 - 2013. As part of a statewide managed care readiness program, hospitals were required to notify a contracted managed behavioral health organization (MBHO) of Medicaid fee-for-service admissions to a hospital psychiatric unit and report whether they: 1) communicated with current or prior outpatient mental health providers; 2) scheduled a follow-up appointment with an outpatient provider; and 3) forwarded a case summary to the outpatient provider. The proposed project combines data from MBHOs with Medicaid claims data and information on hospital, outpatient provider, and regional service system characteristics. We will determine the rates at which hospital providers completed each of the three care transition practices and identify characteristics of patients that did and did not receive each practice. We will then determine the effectiveness of the care transition practices after controlling for patien characteristics (e.g., co-morbid general medical or substance use disorders, lack of contact with providers prior to admission), hospital characteristics (e.g., size, teaching status, presence of on-site outpatient services), characteristics of outpatient providers receiving referrals (e.g., sie, type, availability of care management supports), and regional service system characteristics (e.g., provider capacity, population density, per capita income) known to impact care transitions. We will determine whether the care transition practices were effective in high-need subgroups such as youth, patients with prior failure to attend outpatient care or frequent use of hospital services, and patients with co- morbid general medical disorders. Finally, we will identify patient subgroups for which the practices were insufficient and that are likely to require more intensive approaches to ensure successful care transitions. Findings from this project will guide provider efforts to improve care transitions, provide validity data for potential new quality measures related to mental health care transitions, and inform system level quality improvement initiatives that will further strengthen safety net services for Medicaid patients."
"9478843","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In lupus nephritis (LuN) renal biopsies are used to assess the extent of renal involvement, assign prognosis and to aid in making therapeutic decisions. While current classification criteria focus on glomerular disease we and other groups have demonstrated that the degree of tubulointerstitial inflammation (TII) and scarring, and not glomerular injury1, predict progression to renal failure. During the last funding cycle, we demonstrated that lupus TII has many of the features of tertiary lymphoid neogenesis (TLN), including the propagation of in situ antigen-driven humoral immune responses. Therefore, LuN may arise from both systemic (GN) and organ- intrinsic (TII) autoimmune pathogenic mechanisms. As demonstrated, we have cloned and characterized a full panel of in situ expressed antibodies. Surprisingly, the predominant antigen driving in situ humoral selection was vimentin. Vimentin was highly expressed by infiltrating inflammatory cells and in situ selected antibodies preferentially bound to inflamed renal tissue. Furthermore, high-titers of serum anti-vimentin antibodies (AVAs) were highly specific for severe lupus TII. For B cell activation, second signals are necessary that, in SLOs are provided by T follicular helper cells (TFH). In preliminary data, we demonstrate that TFH cells are a common feature of severe lupus TII. Furthermore, using laser capture microscopy, and novel computational tools that we have developed, we demonstrated that these TFH cells provide cognate help to most infiltrating B cells. These findings suggest a general model in which coordination between antigen-related T cells and antigen presenting cells drives in situ adaptive immunity and amplifies inflammation. We will test this model in the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. To define the prevalence, origin, and clinical significance of anti-vimentin antibodies. Aim 2. Understand the functional importance of anti-vimentin antibodies. Aim 3. To elucidate the network of cognate interactions between T cell and antigen presenting cell populations in TII."
"9477155","Introduction: The Glove Rehabilitation Application for Stroke Patients (GRASP) Fast-Track SBIR program will promote recovery of hand function following stroke through an instrumented orthosis that enables functional practice of manual tasks in fun and engaging activities within a virtual environment. The effort combines patented sensor glove technology developed under the NASA space suit program with a commercial hand orthosis and modern game engine technology. GRASP will automatically assess a patient?s functional level and adapt the challenge to his/her capabilities. In each session, the system will automatically produce valid metrics of hand function, providing both patients and providers with immediate feedback on status and progress. The low-cost product will support independent home use as well as serve as part of a therapistguided in-patient, skilled nursing, outpatient, home health, or teletherapy rehabilitation program. Problem to be addressed: GRASP addresses the critical challenges of: (1) improving outcomes in hand therapy through task-directed practice and mental imagery that promote functional recovery; (2) enabling increased dosage, intensity, and duration through independent home use and teletherapy; (3) minimizing total cost of rehabilitation by reducing patient/therapist travel; and (4) improving services in underserved areas. Long-Term Goal: Improved outcomes and functional independence for patients with acquired brain injury. Phase I Summary: Phase I of the Fast-Track will produce a prototype system that consists of a sensor package and software application that permits a commercial glove orthosis to be used for practice of virtual activities of daily living (ADLs) in a compelling virtual world. A pilot study conducted by the University of Virginia (UVa), UVa HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital, and Continuum Home Health will investigate the primary Phase I hypothesis, which states that GRASP-generated metrics correlate significantly with accepted measures of hand function. Two Phase I case studies led by home health therapists will explore usability in the home environment and serve as pathfinders for Phase II efficacy trials. Phase II Summary: Phase II of the Fast-Track will include: (1) development of a commercial system; (2) extension of the range of hand therapy activities and expansion of virtual environments to provide an engaging and motivating experience across 8 weeks of treatment; (3) provider tools for prescribing and monitoring status/progress; and (4) teletherapy interfaces. A Phase II efficacy study will investigate improvement in standardized assessment scores and adherence for GRASP at-home therapy vs. standard care. Randomized, controlled trials will be led by UVa in partnership with HealthSouth and Continuum Home Health. Commercial Opportunity: Approximately 50% of the 800,000 individuals hospitalized due to stroke each year in the U.S. suffer from chronic deficits in hand and/or arm function [1], [2]. GRASP is poised to rapidly transition evidence-based research to market by leveraging an existing brand with well-defined distribution channels."
"9387017","Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is more severe and debilitating in patients with advanced cancer (ACP) than in those with early cancer or in survivors. Prior drug studies for CRF in palliative care have shown mixed results. Recent studies show that 8 mg/day dexamethasone (DEX) for one week is safe and significantly improves CRF. However, this treatment does not completely relieve CRF and therefore further studies are needed to treat this distressing symptom. Physical activity (PA) has the best evidence for treatment of CRF but its effect size is modest (0.23) in improving CRF. Hence, new treatment strategies are greatly needed. Here we propose a combination of PA with a short course of DEX with the idea that the combination would provide a more robust improvement of CRF due to anti-inflammatory effects, improvement in symptom distress, and improvement in overall well-being. Furthermore, DEX would facilitate the initiation of and adherence to the PA intervention, and thereby engage and sustain PA over a period of at least 4 weeks (the duration of the study) in a potentially synergistic manner. Objective/Hypothesis: The objective of the proposed study is to build on our prior studies to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the combination of physical activity and a short course of dexamethasone (hereafter abbreviated PA+ DEX) for cancer-related fatigue in advanced cancer, and will inform larger, adequately-powered effectiveness studies of PA+DEX toward a long-term goal of finding highly effective interventions for CRF. The study will test the hypothesis that, in patients with advanced cancer, the combination of dexamethasone with exercise will prove both feasible and beneficial. Specific Aims: Primary: To test the hypotheses that patients with CRF will be satisfied with the PA+ DEX intervention, have adequate rates of adherence, and that PA+ DEX will be feasible for patients with CRF. Exploratory: To test the hypothesis that PA+ DEX will be more efficacious than PA+ placebo (PA for 4 weeks plus placebo for 1 week) on CRF as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy- Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F). To explore the effects of PA+ DEX on fatigue-related symptoms and function. Study design: Patients with a diagnosis of advanced cancer and fatigue score of ?4/10 (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale) will be admitted to this study. We will use a randomized controlled design to randomly assign 70 eligible patients to receive either 8 mg/day DEX or Placebo orally for 7 days with a validated and supervised physical activity intervention for 4 weeks. Patients will complete the outlined assessments at baseline, Day 8, Day 15, Day 29, and Day 60 of the study. Feasibility, adherence, and satisfaction with the combined interventions will be assessed, and the preliminary efficacy of the combined interventions will be evaluated using the change in FACIT-F subscale scores."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescents with substance use disorders (ASUD) in residential treatment have the most serious substance use disorders and the highest rates of psychological, motivational, behavioral, legal, environmental, and vocational problems. ASUD in residential treatment are also at extremely high risk of relapse, with follow-up studies suggesting that 60% of ASUD will relapse within the first 90 days of discharge. Parenting practices have been established as a key influence on adolescents' initiation and maintenance of substance use, as well as their substance use outcomes and likelihood of relapse. However, therapists who treat ASUD have reported a myriad of systemic barriers to engaging parents in treatment. Findings such as these deem ASUD in residential treatment a high priority population and argue for the value of easily accessible parenting interventions during this critical time. The proposed study evaluates one potential low cost, low intensity model for delivering parenting skills to parents preparing for their adolescent's discharge from residential substance use treatment. Specifically, this project involves adapting the delivery of a computerized parenting intervention (Parenting Wisely; PW) that has preliminary evidence of efficacy in improving parenting skills and reducing youth behavior problems. This study adapts the delivery of PW for a new population (parents of ASUD preparing for discharge) and new setting (residential treatment), and obtains initial data on its feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. First, an open trialwith 10 parents will adapt the delivery of PW to include moderate engagement strategies relevant to this population. Initial engagement strategies have been developed based on focus groups and interviews with 13 parents, 11 ASUD, and three staff members and include up to six sessions of individualized coaching that begin prior to discharge (incorporated into standing family appointment times) and the use of technology (e.g., text messaging and an online parent message board) to maintain contact between staff and parents post-discharge. Second, a randomized trial with 60 parents will compare an adapted PW plus treatment as usual (TAU) condition (PW+TAU) versus TAU only in a residential treatment center. Both treatment conditions will be delivered by Master's-level community clinicians. Use of a low-cost, low-intensity intervention paired with moderate engagement strategies represents a marked change from traditional treatment delivery methods, with potential for extending treatment gains after discharge. Innovative aspects of the current approach include its timing, use of novel engagement strategies, combination of in-person and computer-delivered content, and focus on putative mediators. The approach has the potential to advance public health by: addressing a high-needs population; targeting parenting practices (putative mediators of change) that have been shown to influence ASUD outcomes; working with parents during a critical treatment juncture; improving parental engagement and access to care, and increasing ease of dissemination and implementation."
"9539450","Epilepsy results from an imbalance in neuronal excitation and inhibition within the brain. One of the most common forms of epilepsy is temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and a large percentage of TLE patients are refractory to medical treatment. TLE is associated with cell loss, gliosis, altered neurogenesis, axon sprouting, and synaptic reorganization in both humans and animal models of TLE. These changes are best described in the hippocampus, which becomes hyperexcitable in epilepsy and can serve as an initiating seizure focus in TLE. In rodent models, there is increased proliferation of adult-born neurons in the hippocampus in TLE, and these new neurons integrate abnormally into neuronal circuits and are believed to contribute to epileptogenesis. Glutamatergic signaling and synapse formation are critical for the proper maturation, synaptic integration, and survival of adult-born dentate granule cells (DGCs), and a recent study demonstrated that hilar mossy cells serve as the first glutamatergic inputs to adult-born DGCs. Interestingly, these hippocampal mossy cells are also highly susceptible to apoptosis after seizures. This suggests that the loss of mossy cells after status epilepticus could alter the maturation and synapse formation by adult-born DGCs and thus the loss of these cells may be a critical step in pathogenesis of epilepsy via its effect on post-seizure neurogenesis. This proposal will investigate how mossy cells contribute to the normal maturation and network integration of adult- born granule cells, and whether mossy cell loss contributes to the abnormal synaptic integration, maturation, and survival of adult-born DGCs in epilepsy. In addition, we will directly test whether the rescue of mossy cell loss prevents alterations in neurogenesis and the development of epilepsy. We will use a mossy cell specific Cre driver mouse line to selectively modify mossy cell activity and survival using pharmacogenetics, diphtheria toxin-mediated cell ablation, and inhibition of apoptosis, and assess changes in adult-born DGC synaptic integration and survival. Additionally, we will combine these techniques with the well-established pilocarpine model of TLE, to assess how mossy cell death affects adult-born DGC maturation and epileptogenesis. We hypothesize that mossy cell activity is critical for proper integration, maturation, and survival of adult-born granule cells and that a reduction in mossy cell loss will restore these features and reduce epileptogenesis after status epilepticus in mice. This study will not only greatly improve our understanding of the role of mossy cells in neurogenesis and epilepsy, but could lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for many types of refractory epilepsies."
"9560641","SUMMARY It is increasingly recognized that cash and in-kind incentives can motivate behavior change and improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum. Under the right circumstances, incentives can increase the demand for HIV testing, change short-term sexual behavior, enhance linkage to care after HIV diagnosis, and promote short-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. However, there is a paucity of long-term follow-up data about incentive-based programs for people living with HIV infection (PLHIV). This research gap limits our understanding of whether these approaches are worthwhile investments, especially in the generalized HIV epidemics in Sub-Saharan Africa. The proposed research will advance global knowledge about the long-term effectiveness of incentives for ART adherence and retention in care, and their potential effectiveness for re-engagement in care. We will build on preliminary data from a study we conducted in Shinyanga, Tanzania which found that short-term cash and food assistance improved ART adherence and retention in care among food insecure PLHIV after 6 and 12 months of follow-up. We will now leverage our established research program to determine the long-term effectiveness of these incentive strategies. In our 2-year study, we will first determine 24-month adherence and retention outcomes using medical and pharmacy records for the 781 PLHIV who were alive at the end of our previous study, which concluded after 12 months of follow-up (Aim 1). Then, leveraging an existing program of home based care, we will determine the prevalence of undocumented transfers and deaths among the subset of patients found to be lost to follow-up or transferred in clinic records. We will use these data from home visits to adjust estimates of the interventions' effectiveness on retention in HIV care and mortality (Aim 2). Among the PLHIV found to be disengaged from care, we will conduct a pilot study of a one-time cash incentive to encourage PLHIV to re-engage with care, with the goal of mitigating the barriers posed by transportation and opportunity costs (Aim 3). At the conclusion of the project, we will know the long-term effectiveness of cash and food incentives for adherence and retention, and whether they can also be used for re-linking PLHIV to care, data highly relevant to `Treat All' programs in Fast Track countries. This timely information will be widely applicable to the spectrum of incentive-based programs currently being designed, implemented, or under consideration to improve the health of PLHIV. Furthermore, this research will help policy makers understand whether incentive-based programs should be incorporated into ongoing `treatment as prevention' (TasP) programs. 1"
"9481222","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. David Perry, a behavioral neurology fellow at the University of California, San Francisco Memory and Aging Center (MAC). Dr. Perry is establishing himself as a young investigator in patient-oriented clinical research of reward processing in neurodegenerative disease. This K23 award will provide Dr. Perry with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: 1) to gain expertise in neurodegenerative disease and neuropsychiatric symptom management; 2) to develop proficiency in the use and analysis of structural and functional neuroimaging; 3) to gain experience in the use of psychophysiological measures; 4) to advance his knowledge of biostatistics [and clinical trials]; and 5) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Perry has assembled a mentoring team comprised of two primary mentors: Dr. Howard Rosen (a neurologist with expertise in neurodegenerative disease, psychophysiology, and neuroimaging analysis) and Dr. Joel Kramer (a neuropsychologist with expertise in cognitive and behavioral systems); one co-mentor, Dr. Bruce Miller (neurologist with expertise in behavioral neurology, neurodegenerative disease, and clinical research); and five consultants: [Dr. Craig Nelson (a geriatric psychiatrist), Dr. Chiadi Onyike (a geriatric psychiatrist and specialist in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD)), Dr. Adam Boxer (a neurologist with expertise in clinical trials in bvFTD),] Dr. John Neuhaus (a biostatistician) and Dr. Mark D'Esposito (a professor of neuroscience with expertise in functional neuroimaging and reward processing).  The proposed research will examine reward processing in bvFTD. Reward processing involves a determination of what an individual will pursue or work for, such as food, money, or social approval. Dr. Perry will administer laboratory tasks of reward processing to patients with bvFTD, Alzheimer's disease, and healthy control subjects to determine the aspect of valuation of reward that is altered in bvFTD (Aim 1). Dr. Perry will correlate the findings from these laboratory tasks with structural and functional imaging to determine the anatomic correlates of these behaviors (Aim 2) and with real-life functional measures to determine the effect reward processing changes have in patients' lives (Aim 3). Data collection will take place at the MAC. The results of this research will improve understanding of the behavioral symptoms in bvFTD, will direct future studies into symptomatic treatment in the illness, will provide objective tests to distinguish neurodegenerative diseases, and will offer reward-based measures as an additional tool for use in animal models of bvFTD. This K23 training will enable Dr. Perry to apply concepts of reward processing to the understanding of other neurodegenerative diseases."

"9472272","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aerobic exercise holds promise for treating cognitive impairment and altering brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD currently afflicts 5.4 million Americans and will affect 14 million by 2050 if no cure is found. Cognitive impairment is the hallmark symptom of AD and contributes to the manifestation of other symptoms that result in poor outcomes, including low quality of life, early institutionalization, and high costs (valuedat $202.6 billion in 2010). Exercise studies in AD are just emerging and have produced conflicting findings on cognitive outcomes, largely due to low doses, poor delivery of aerobic exercise, and lack of controls. This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be the first to investigate the effects of a novel 6-month, individualized, moderate-intensity cycling intervention on cognition and hippocampal volume in community-dwelling older adults with mild-to-moderate AD. Two complementary frameworks guide our study: the cardiovascular fitness hypothesis that suggests increased aerobic fitness improves cognition; and the biological mechanistic theory which addresses the lack of specificity of the first framework by identifying the mechanisms of action of aerobic exercise. Dr. Yu (PI), an Early-Stage Investigator, has successfully led her interdisciplinary team to develop and execute the 6-month cycling intervention, establish the feasibility of recruitment, retention, and adherence, and show positive cognitive results via 3 pretest posttest studies. This pilot RCT will randomize 90 subjects to the 6-month cycling intervention or attention control (sham exercise) groups using permuted blocks of 3 and 6 subjects randomly and a 2:1 allocation ratio, and follow them for another 6 months. Cognition will be measured by the AD Assessment Scale-Cognition (ADAS-Cog) at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Hippocampal volume will be measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline, 6, and 12 months. The sample size will give us 80% power to detect at least a 2.5-point difference in within-group changes in ADAS-Cog at 6 months. The specific aims are: Aim I. Determine the immediate effect of the cycling intervention on cognition in AD. We hypothesize that intervention subjects will have a smaller within-group increase in ADAS-Cog at 6 months than placebo subjects in AD drug RCTs, while control subjects will have the same increase as placebo subjects in AD drug RCTs. Aim II. Examine if the cycling intervention slows cognitive decline in AD from baseline to 12 months. We expect that intervention subjects will show a smaller increase in ADAS-Cog over 12 months than control subjects. Aim III: Assess the effect of aerobic exercise on hippocampal volume in AD over 12 months using MRI. We expect that intervention subjects will have a smaller decrease in hippocampal volume over 12 months than control subjects. The study's broad impacts are to address the critical gap in knowledge of the therapeutic effects of aerobic exercise in AD and offer a potentially effective treatment for AD. This pilot study will inform a future full-scale RCT that will address our long-term goal of elucidating how aerobic exercise alters AD progression and provide important foundations for future research."
"9472773","Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease affecting more than 12 million people and causing 20-40 thousand deaths every year in tropical and subtropical regions. To infect humans and promote disease, Leishmania parasites use sophisticated virulence mechanisms to evade host cell defenses and exploit cellular resources. During Leishmaniasis, amastigote forms of the parasite sustain the infection and cause disease symptoms through repeated cycles of intracellular proliferation, escape to the extracellular milieu and then re-invasion of naive cells. Macrophages are main cell type infected by amastigotes because they efficiently recognize and internalize amastigotes through receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Yet, macrophages are unable to kill these intracellular parasites, which instead establish a specialized replicative niche in a modified phagolysosome-like compartment, known as the parasitophorous vacuole (PV). This proposal is focused on the study of a newly identified host factor exploited by Leishmania parasites for successful invasion and niche establishment, the scavenger receptor CD36. After using Drosophila as screening platform, we discovered that the scavenger receptor CD36 was required for biogenesis of the enlarged parasitophorous vacuole of L. amazonensis. This organelle dilutes the toxic effects of nitric oxide and allows parasite proliferation. Given the importance of the PV as intracellular niche for Leishmania replication, we propose in Aim 1 to investigate the mechanisms by which CD36 regulates the PV size. Aim 2 is focused in the identification of the CD36 binding domain and the parasite component that binds to CD36 and triggers PV enlargement."
"9543820","Title: The interplay between RAD51C sub-complexes during replication fork repair Abstract: Alkylating agents are an environmentally relevant class of DNA damaging compounds that can cause replication fork damage and subsequent collapse leading to double-strand breaks (DSBs). One important group of proteins used to repair DSBs includes the RAD51 paralogs. However, the role of the RAD51 paralogs in response to alkylation-induced DNA damage has been understudied in human cells. The RAD51 paralog family consists of five proteins in humans, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3. They are known to assemble into sub-complexes with themselves and with other homologous recombination (HR) factors, but how each complex functions, and the DNA substrates they act upon remains undetermined. RAD51C is a member of multiple sub-complexes, and importantly mutations in RAD51C are linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancers and to Fanconi Anemia. Recently, the RAD51 paralogs have been found to localize to replication forks, but their recruitment to damaged forks, such as those induced by alkylation damage, remains to be investigated. My work will determine the importance of RAD51C in the repair of alkylation-induced DNA damage at replication forks. Using environmentally relevant alkylating agents and the prototypical methylating agent, methylmethane sulfonate, I will measure RAD51C presence at replication forks using the new technology, isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND). Further, by depleting RAD51C complex members in conditional knockout cell lines, I will use immunofluorescence and iPOND to visualize the consequential changes in RAD51C localization to determine which RAD51C containing sub-complexes are involved in repair of alkylation-damaged forks. Using yeast-two-hybrid analysis to screen cancer-associated RAD51C mutations, I will identify mutants that disrupt individual RAD51C-associated complexes. RAD51C separation-of-function mutations selected for functional analysis will be validated for interaction changes by co- immunoprecipitation and in vitro pull-downs. Using these RAD51C mutations, I will determine at which steps of repair RAD51C-associated complexes regulate repair in response to alkylation damage. These complementary approaches will determine the contribution of RAD51C in repair of alkylation-induced DNA damage and its overall role in preserving genomic stability. Further, this work will aid in our understanding of the significance of environmental factors that contribute to the cancer predisposition of individuals with RAD51 paralog mutations.  "
"9556945","This Phase I SBIR is prompted by the need for more effective Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices for persons unable to communicate through vocalization. The project follows our preliminary work that translates surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals recorded from speech articulation muscles during silently mouthed ?subvocal? speech to produce hands-free intelligible textual communication on an Android or other AAC platform. Now we undertake a first-of-its-kind AAC system that restores personalized, natural expressive vocal communication through an advanced sEMG-based neural interface. This innovation will have broad impact among millions of AAC users by restoring not only the vocabulary, but the prosodic attributes of speech directly to personalized voice synthesis technologies. To achieve this unprecedented goal, our team of experts in sEMG-based subvocal speech recognition at Altec, Inc will partner with VocalID, the world?s leading provider of personalized text-to-voice synthesis for AAC devices. In Phase I we will develop algorithms for tracking sEMG-based changes in prosody at the phrase-level of subvocal speech (Aim 1), synthesize the prosodic changes into personalized digital voice (Aim 2), and establish the proof-of-principle that the sEMG-based digitized voice can communicate phrases with declarative, interrogative and contrastive prosody effectively in people with laryngectomy ? a high-need patient population that lacks the ability to vocalize (Aim 3). Phase II will advance the recognition of intonation, loudness and timing at the triphone-level of subvocal speech and directly synthesize, in real-time, a personalized, intelligible and expressive voice that is capable of communicating meaning, emotion and intent. Our final deliverable will be an AAC system that is unique in restoring acoustic speech for those who live without their natural voice. The device will be packaged as a wearable system that provides natural embodiment, cosmetic appeal, and intuitive vocal capabilities. It will be hands-free, will not suffer from poor intelligibility, will not need surgical intervention or invasive maintenance, and will be readily adaptable to man-machine interface for improved AAC control. The impact of this innovation is that it will provide singular technology that restores personalized and prosodic vocal capabilities to the natural intuitive mechanisms of speech production for the vocally-impaired."
"9520645","Role of Twist2 myogenic progenitor cells in adult skeletal muscle Project Summary/Abstract Adult skeletal muscle can adapt muscle mass and myofiber size under physiological and pathological conditions. Mechanical overload and hormone stimulation result in muscle growth in the form of hypertrophy and enhanced muscle strength and function. In contrast, loss of muscle mass and strength during aging and disease has profound negative consequences, leading to frailty, disability and mortality. With the world?s elderly population growing dramatically, there is an urgent need to understand the requirements for maintaining muscle homeostasis and to development therapeutic treatments for sarcopenia and cachexia. Recently, we identified a novel myogenic progenitor marked by the expression of a bHLH transcription factor Twis2 (Tw2). In adult muscle, Tw2 is expressed in interstitial cells but not mature myofibers or satellite cells. Genetic lineage tracing revealed that the Tw2+ progenitor cell population contributes specifically to type IIb/x myofibers in adult muscle during homeostasis and regeneration. Ablation of these Tw2+ cells causes type IIb fiber specific myofiber atrophy during aging. These findings highlight the unique role of Tw2+ cells in maintaining type IIb myofibers during aging. The overall goals of this project are designed to decipher the mechanisms whereby Tw2+ cells contribute to type IIb/x myofibers, to elucidate the mechanisms whereby Tw2 controls stemness and quiescence of Tw2+ cells, and to define the roles of Tw2+ cells in skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy. Ultimately, we hope to use these insights to develop new strategies to therapeutically modulate muscle mass, strength and function during aging and disease."
"9625258","PROJECT SUMMARY Increased microvascular permeability is central to the pathogenesis of sepsis and multi-organ system dysfunction. Our group has identified cell-free hemoglobin (CFH), hemoglobin that has escaped from the antioxidant confines of the red blood cell (RBC), as a major proximal trigger of increased microvascular permeability in sepsis. The increase in circulating CFH in sepsis is thought to be due to sepsis-induced red cell fragility. Our parent R01 tests the hypothesis that CFH is a key endogenous mediator of sepsis-induced ARDS through its induction of endothelial mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to increased pulmonary microvascular permeability. Our initial studies are well underway to test this hypothesis, focusing on the downstream effects of CFH on the endothelium. However, the determinants of increased RBC fragility and increased endothelial susceptibility to CFH-mediated injury during sepsis are unknown. Published data and our preliminary studies point to ascorbate, Vitamin C, as a key regulator of both RBC fragility and endothelial sensitivity to injury in sepsis. Low RBC ascorbate concentrations increase red blood cell fragility in diabetes, priming the red cells to hemolyze and release CFH, but the effects of ascorbate on RBC fragility in sepsis has never been studied. Our group recently reported that ascorbate depletion of primary human endothelial cells makes them more susceptible to CFH-mediated increases in paracellular permeability and that restoring intracellular ascorbate concentrations attenuates this effect. Thus, low ascorbate concentrations in sepsis have the potential to both increase RBC fragility and prime the endothelium for increased permeability. In additional preliminary studies, we found that supplementation of ascorbate in an isolated perfused human lung model attenuated the increased vascular permeability induced by CFH. With these compelling studies as a foundation and the support of this NHLBI administrative supplement, we will address two critical knowledge gaps: (1) what are the effects of intracellular ascorbate levels on RBC fragility and CFH release and (2) do intracellular ascorbate levels modify the effects of CFH on endothelial permeability in sepsis? These questions are timely as there are several ongoing clinical trials of ascorbate supplementation in sepsis with a paucity of mechanistic, pre-clinical data to support this therapeutic approach. In this application we will fill these knowledge gaps by testing the overarching hypothesis that intracellular ascorbate depletion in sepsis is a key mediator of both increased hemolysis and CFH-mediated increases in microvascular permeability. This hypothesis will be tested within the scope of the parent grant with the following two Aims: (1) To test the hypothesis that low intracellular levels of RBC ascorbate increase RBC fragility in sepsis, and (2) To test the hypothesis that circulating and tissue levels of ascorbate are decreased in a mouse model of sepsis, augmenting the effects of CFH on increased endothelial permeability. This project is within the scope of the parent proposal, will answer key questions in the sepsis field and will address a major goal of the Office of Dietary Supplements."

"9485196","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My career goal is to become an independent investigator whose work improves conversations between clinicians and older patients with advanced heart failure (HF) and their caregivers. This application proposes a five-year curriculum and research plan designed to facilitate my development to an independent investigator in patient-oriented aging research. During the five years of the award, I will expand my research training and experience through mentored research, formal coursework and self-directed learning activities and develop independence through leadership and networking opportunities. The work proposed in this application involves studying goals of care discussions (GOCD) in older adults with advanced HF. As one of the leading causes of death, hospitalization, readmission and Medicare costs, HF is associated with poor health-related quality of life, significant psychological distress and increased health care spending for patients and their caregivers. The complex and changing trajectory of advanced HF along with the available life-sustaining therapies makes decision-making more complex in older adults as compared to other serious illnesses. Recent data in advanced cancer patients demonstrate that GOCD result in improved patient and caregiver outcomes. Unlike cancer, HF patients have highly variable prognoses, invasive potential treatments associated with major lifestyle changes, and unpredictable symptom crises, which make it difficult to extrapolate findings from cancer to HF. This proposal aims to address this gap. We hypothesize that improved GOCD will result in improved patient outcomes (receipt of treatments aligned with preferences, better quality of life, less depression and anxiety and decreased utilization) and caregiver outcomes (less depression, anxiety and caregiver burden, and improved satisfaction) as compared to patients who do not have GOCD. The aims of these projects are: (SA1) to identify barriers and facilitators to GOCD in older adults with advanced HF and to identify patient and caregiver health-related outcomes associated with GOCD; (SA2) to develop and refine HF Connect, a HF- specific GOCD training module, to meet the unique needs of these patients and caregivers; and (SA3) to conduct a pilot RCT of PREPARE + HF Connect to determine feasibility of enrollment, efficacy to increase GOCD and advanced care planning behaviors, and satisfaction with the tailored module. To achieve the first aim, I will analyze a multicenter cohort of advanced HF patients and their caregivers to identify the factors that predict GOCD and outcomes of these conversations. Next, I will interview patient/caregiver dyads to identify barriers and facilitatorsof GOCDs. Using SA1 data, I will develop HF Connect and use cognitive interviews with patients, caregivers and clinicians to refine it (SA 2). Finally, I will conduct a small RCT of HF Connect (SA3) to determine its feasibility and efficacy. These studies will generate data that will allow m to secure R01-level funding to test HF Connect in a multicenter RCT. The proposed research and career development plan are initial steps toward improving the care of older adults with advanced HF and their caregivers."
"9656321","Abstract: The Lung DNA Virome in Health and Disease We live in an interdependent relationship with our resident microbiota, which strongly influence human health and disease. Microbial communities differ at different body sites, and have distinctive consequences at each. The relationship between humans and their microbes has been most extensively studied for our bacterial communities but far less is known about the human virome, particularly in the respiratory tract. In preliminary studies, we used shotgun metagenomics to investigate the lung virome in several subject groups. We established efficient methods for purification of viral particles and computational methods for sequence assembly & taxonomic assignment. This revealed a diversity of phage & animal cell viruses. Most prominently, we discovered high levels in lung of Torque Tenoviruses (TTV), a family of small DNA viruses with extreme hypervariability, and we identified a novel group of small circular DNA viruses with limited homology to any previously described viruses (which we term ?human circo-related virus?; HCRV). It is known that TTV in blood is under potent host immune control, but neither cellular immune responses that control TTV in general nor lung-specific regulation have been investigated. Nothing is known about lung-specific HCRV since we identify them here for the first time. These findings highlight major gaps in current knowledge: How do the lung and its ubiquitous communities of viruses interact and affect each other, particularly the abundant small single stranded DNA viruses? What is the influence of cigarette smoking, a principal cause of lung injury? Are these viruses and host immune response to them contributing to lung injury and/or inflammation that drive lung diseases? To accelerate understanding of the lung virome and relationship to lung health & disease, we will: Phase 1 (R61) Years 1-2: To set the stage for further advancement, we will (1) Define the distribution of TTV & HCRV in respiratory tract samples from severely ill lung disease subjects (?extreme phenotype?); (2) Generate & interrogate lung virome metagenomic datasets for additional novel respiratory DNA viruses shared among individuals; (3) Develop a novel ?personalized? assessment of T cell immune responses to hypervariable TTV, and approach to HCRV immune responses; (4) Generate a repository of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens representing lung diseases of high priority for virome & immune analysis in Phase 2. Phase 2 (R33) Years 3-5: We will (1) Define the relationship between lung virome constituents & virome- targeted immune responses, and pulmonary diseases of high priority; (2) Determine the impact of smoking on the lung virome and plasma virome, & virome-targeted immune responses; (3) Define the molecular virology of HCRV, TTV & other small DNA viruses relevant to the lung. This project is designed to be a combination of discovery/hypothesis-generating science as well as specific hypothesis-testing studies as outlined in RFA HL-17-002, which we anticipate will provide novel insight into the nature of the virome within the lungs, and role in lung health and disease."
"9481322","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growth of the pulmonary capillaries by angiogenesis is essential for alveolarization, and disruption of pulmonary angiogenesis contributes to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the most common complication of premature birth. However, the molecular pathways that orchestrate pulmonary angiogenesis during development and disease are not fully understood. This gap in knowledge continues to confound efforts to develop targeted therapies to treat lung diseases caused by impaired angiogenesis, including BPD. Nuclear factor ?-B (NF?B) is a key regulator of inflammation, and growing evidence suggests that NF?B regulates angiogenesis in wound healing in cancer. In contrast, little is known about the role of NF?B in the developing lung. We recently demonstrated that NF?B is essential for alveolarization.  NF?B is constitutively active in the neonatal, but quiescent in the adult lung, and inhibiting NF?B disrupts pulmonary angiogenesis and alveolarization in neonatal mice, but has no effect in adults. Blocking NF?B in neonatal primary pulmonary endothelial cells (PEC) impairs survival, proliferation, and in vitro angiogenesis. Activation of NF?B in the PEC corresponds to the period of angiogenesis in the developing lung, peaking at the onset of alveolarization, and decreasing to low levels by mid-alveolarization. However, the capacity for NF?B to be activated in the PEC is not intrinsic to the cell's maturation, as conditioned media obtained from early alveolar lung organ culture (EA-LCM), robustly activates NF?B and enhances migration in adult PEC. Global proteomic analysis to compare the early alveolar and adult lung secretomes identified factors secreted only by the early alveolar lung (EAL). Studies to examine the effect of neutralizing each of these proteins on the ability of the EA-LCM to promote NF?B activation and migration, allowed the identification of two putative activators of NF?B in the early alveolar lung: transforming growth factor-ß induced protein (TGFBI) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Both factors are expressed in the EAL in vivo but minimally expressed in the adult lung, and both are suppressed by injuries that disrupt alveolarization. Therefore, our data suggest the overall working hypothesis that factors uniquely secreted by the EAL promote lung angiogenesis and alveolarization by activating NF?B in the pulmonary endothelium by addressing two inter-related specific aims. In Aim 1, we will examine if TGFBI and AFP secretion by the EAL induces a pro-angiogenic phenotype in the PEC via an NF?B-dependent pathway, and explore if TGFBI and AFP activate common or complementary patterns of gene expression. Aim 2 will utilize in vivo gain and loss of function strategies to determine if disrupting TGFBI- or AFP-mediated activation of NF?B impairs alveolar growth during development and injury. The successful completion of these studies will establish a novel, physiologic role for NF?B in the developing lung, and identify new angiogenic factors that can be directly translated into therapeutic strategies to promote lung growth and regeneration in diseases marked by impaired pulmonary angiogenesis."

To enable these technologies the Core will form partnerships with government  agencies in including the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Agency for Toxic Substances  and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and will promote the application of technologies based on the environmental  and environmental health sciences research of the Penn-SRP that are consistent with EPA's Risk Assessment  Guidance for Superfund (RAGS) and may be used as a model approach to enhance Volume I: Parts A-F of  RAGS. These goals will be met under the following four Specific Aims: Aim 1: To communicate scientific  advances within the Penn SRP as well as to the greater SRP community. The Core will work with project  and core investigators to identify deliverables and coordinate research translation opportunities. It will pursue  research translation opportunities emanating from the goals of the overall Center and report its activity within  the SRP, to SRP staff at NIEHS and other SRP Centers. Aim 2: To form partnerships with government  agencies. The Core will strengthen the capacity of U.S. EPA decision-making officials in both the Superfund  Program and the Office of Research and Development by conducting peer-reviewed scientific investigations  that will enhance human and ecological safeguards in the public and private sectors. It will develop active  partnerships and communication tools with staff at the headquarters and regional offices of the EPA & ATSDR  (HHS) to promote technical and policy applications on how our remediation strategies and biomarker work can  help remediate asbestos containing sites and enhance risk-assessment. Aim 3: To translate findings into  products through use of Technology Transfer. The Core will use its Technology Development and Transfer  Committee to identify the non-biomedical and biomedical technologies that should be advanced through the  intellectual property process into products and patents. Aim 4: To disseminate information to other end  users. To promote innovative and cost-effective alternatives to protect the environment and public health the  Core will develop communication tools and strategies to inform communities, hazardous waste practitioners  and public health professionals, and the lay public of advances made by the Penn-SRP."
"9478018","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a proteinopathy characterized by deficient proteostasis of amyloid ß-protein and tau. Therefore, enhancement of clearance of the misfolded proteins involved in AD is a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing and treating the disease. We have been developing molecular tweezers (MTs) which act as Misfolded-Proteins Clearance Enhancers (MPCEs) using a unique mechanism. MTs bind to amyloidogenic proteins and remodel their abnormal self-assembly into non-toxic and non-amyloidogenic structures that can be efficiently degraded by the natural cellular clearance mechanisms. Our current lead compound, CLR01, has been found to be effective in multiple in vitro and in vivo systems, including prevention of Aß self-assembly and toxicity, inhibition of tau aggregation, and reduction of both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in transgenic mouse brain. In addition, CLR01 was shown to have a high safety margin. However, the pharmacological characteristics of CLR01 need to be optimized, its effect on tau needs to be explored further, and certain questions about its mechanism of action and therapeutic potential are yet to be answered. In this project we will use a multi-prong approach to optimizing CLR01's pharmacokinetics, expand the characterization of its effect on tau, study CLR01's binding to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, and characterize the capability of different doses and treatment durations of CLR01 treatment to remove toxic Aß and tau oligomers, reduce synaptotoxicity, and improve learning and memory deficits in a mouse model of AD. The study is expected to address currently unanswered questions and provide strong support for future formal development of MTs towards prevention and disease-modifying treatment of AD."
"9597039","Abstract This project will determine how three closely related editosomes, precisely edit mRNAs and do so differentially between life cycle stages in Trypanosoma brucei. We hypothesize that insertion and deletion editosome compositional and structural differences enable differential binding and catalysis of specific gRNA/mRNA substrates during editing and the differential editing between developmental stages. We will: 1. Determine the high resolution structures of insertion and deletion editosomes, subcomplexes thereof, and RNA association by cryoEM. Samples for cryoEM will be purified from cells with one type of functional or catalytically arrested editosome. This will determine detailed editosomes architecture, protein stoichiometry, RNA location and differences between these editosomes. 2. Determine the roles non-catalytic editosome proteins/domains. We will determine if endonuclease partner proteins function as heterodimers and if noncatalytic proteins function in substrate RNA binding and positioning. The catalytic function of recombinant heterodimers will be assayed by crosslinking, mutagenesis and sequencing and functional RNA-protein interactions will be identified in vivo. 3. Determine how editosomes progress from one editing site (ES) to the next and test whether editing is either processive or progresses non-sequentially 3' to 5' and if endonuclease subcomplexes exchange between editosomes or not as they encounter different ESs. Cognate gRNA/mRNA pairs engaged in editing in cells with single or multiple types of functional editosomes will be identified and sequenced to resolve whether editing is processive or not. Proximal editosome specific proteins that will be tagged in vivo in cells that contain all three, combinations of two, one, or no functional editosomes that have specific tags and assayed to determine if editosome components exchange or not during editing. These results along RNAseq analysis of their edited RNAs will elucidate how the three different editosomes collaborate to edit multiple ESs specified by a single gRNA, including gRNAs that specify insertion and deletion. 4. Identify key aspects of developmental regulation of RNA editing. We will determine the order in which differentially edited mRNAs arise during development, if these are accompanied by differences in the abundances and editosome associations, of specific 3' initiating gRNAs and cognate gRNA/mRNA pairs, and if these are impacted by mutations that differentially affect editing. Selected structures of BF and PF editosomes will be compared by CXMS, SILAC and cryoEM based on Aim 1. These studies will determine whether specific cognate gRNA/mRNA pairs are differentially bound and utilized as a result of stage specific editosome differences. The project will provide key insights into how three poly- protein complexes function in an integrated fashion to precisely edit mt mRNAs and differentially regulate this process between life cycle stages which adapts energy metabolism to the different environments in the host and the vector."
"9610031","Project Summary  The olfactory epithelium (OE) is chemosensory neuroepithelium lining the posterodorsal surface of the nasal cavity. This neuroepithelium is exceptional in its ability to provide constitutive neurogenesis and regenerate in bulk after injury. Despite the well-documented regenerative capacity of the OE, anosmia is reported in the majority of individuals over the age of 65 and has negative implications for quality of life, nutritional status, and safety. Histology of aged, anosmic human OE has revealed a loss of not only olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) but the globose basal stem and progenitor cells that produce them. In this way, age- deponent olfactory neuropathology is the direct consequence of a failure in long-term tissue homeostasis attributable to exhaustion of neural stem cells.  GBCs were historically recognized as a heterogeneous population of ?active? neural stem and progenitor cells that are exceptional in their ability to provide constitutive OSN replacement and bulk regeneration, dynamically responding to the status of the epithelium. Recently a rare, quiescent subtype of GBC was discovered that retains thymidine labels, activates to contribute to post-injury regeneration via an unknown mechanism, and re-enters into quiescence after regeneration. These label-retaining GBCs (LR- GBCs) are analogous to other label-retaining cells observed, but poorly understood, in a number of epithelial tissues.  The proposed aims seek to develop a mechanistic and molecular understanding of the regulation of LR-GBCs by leveraging the strengths of olfactory epithelium injury models and single-cell transcriptomics. The proliferation and potency of canonical GBCs are enhanced to repopulate the wounded epithelium when mature OSNs are selectively ablated, therefore it bears specifically testing whether LR-GBCs are regulated in a similar fashion. This proposal will investigate the overarching hypothesis that mature olfactory sensory neurons regulate the activation and quiescence of label-retaining GBCs, with the long-term goal of understanding how neural stem cells contribute to age-dependent neuropathology. This will be accomplished by answering the following three questions:  Aim 1 ? Is a selective loss of mature OSNs sufficient for activating LR-GBCs?  Aim 2 ? Are mature OSNs necessary for re-establishing LR-GBCs after injury  Aim 3 ? What genetic programs are activated in LR-GBCs during the acute injury response?"
"9459815","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our research seeks to understand how chromatin regulatory mechanisms influence nuclear and epigenetic programs, and how de-regulation of these mechanisms contributes to aging and disease. SIRT6 is a chromatin regulatory factor in the sirtuin family of enzymes. SIRT6-deficiency in mice leads to shortened lifespan and phenotypes associated with aging, cancer, and metabolism. Conversely, SIRT6 over-expression in mice protects against metabolic disease and extends lifespan. Thus, studying SIRT6 function promises to elucidate fundamental mechanisms that underlie healthy aging and longevity. Previously, we showed that SIRT6 selectively regulates specific chromatin marks associated with epigenetic and gene-regulatory functions. We linked chromatin regulation by SIRT6 to key nuclear processes that impact on aging and cancer, including telomere maintenance, DNA repair, and aging-associated gene expression changes. Here, we focus on new functions of SIRT6 in chromatin silencing mechanisms that are deregulated in aging. We propose molecular, genomic, and functional studies to study the role of SIRT6 in maintaining heterochromatin silencing at repetitive DNA elements, and ask how impaired silencing is linked to aging-associated cellular dysfunction.  In Aim 1, we will study the molecular mechanisms of SIRT6 in heterochromatin silencing of repetitive satellite DNA elements at centromeres. Defects in pericentric heterochromatin are observed in the contexts of both aging and cancer. We will characterize the biochemical activity of SIRT6 at pericentric chromatin and study downstream higher order chromatin changes. Our studies will provide insights for cancer cell biology, where SIRT6 loss may contribute to cancer progression, and for human somatic cells, where SIRT6 may guard against cellular senescence or age-dependent decline in epigenetic plasticity. In Aim 2, we will characterize the functional effects of heterochromatin maintenance by SIRT6 on cellular homeostasis. We will test the hypotheses that pericentric heterochromatin defects trigger abnormal mitoses, chromosome segregation defects, and cellular senescence, or facilitate the oncogenic process of cellular immortalization. We will also examine functional interplay between SIRT6 and other SIRT enzymes in these processes. These studies should elucidate how heterochromatin breakdown is translated into cellular phenotypes or functional decline that contributes to aging and disease. In Aim 3, we will investigate the role of SIRT6 in heterochromatin maintenance at another class of repetitive DNA elements that are deregulated in aging and cancer - endogenous retrotransposable elements. We will ask if impaired silencing of these elements is associated with genomic instability that can affect cellular function, or to aberrant transcription of aging-related genes.  Together, these studies should provide insights into fundamental chromatin mechanisms in aging biology."
"9371943","PROJECT SUMMARY  Electronic cigarettes, also known as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), are rapidly spreading around the world, including to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study will help understand the impacts of ENDS and the policies to regulate them. We will collaborate with the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project, which recently received a large grant to evaluate the impact of ENDS use and its regulations across high-income countries (i.e., Canada, England, US) with contrasting policies. The proposed project would collect original data in Mexico and Guatemala in order to integrate them into this effort. The project has the following specific aims: AIM 1. Compare the initiation and consequences of ENDS use among adolescents in Guatemala and Mexico, two neighboring countries with contrasting tobacco policy environments. We will survey and follow 2000 Guatemalan adolescents to understand what promotes ENDS use and whether it leads them to start using conventional cigarettes. An experiment will assess options for ENDS policy (e.g., warnings, marketing bans). Results will be compared to Mexican youth, from whom we are currently collecting data. AIM 2. Determine the predictors and outcomes for ENDS use among established adult smokers in Mexico. We will survey adult smokers who participated in our prior research, as well as smokers recruited online, in order to understand whether ENDS use reduces harm by helping them quit or reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke. Results will be compared with other countries. AIM 3. Characterize the labeling, design and constituents of ENDS products in Guatemala and Mexico. We will analyze ENDS devices and ?e-liquids? (i.e., liquids that devices vaporize) in both countries, to assess: 1. labeling (e.g., warnings, marketing); 2. device design (e.g., battery strength); 3. e-liquid constituents (e.g., nicotine, flavorings, toxicants). We will assess time trends and cross-country differences. AIM 4. Adapt a simulation model for predicting trends in ENDS and cigarette use, including the public health impact of different ENDS policies. We will build on our prior simulation research in Mexico, using data from Aims 1-3 and ongoing studies to integrate ENDS use into the simulation model. The model will project future trends in nicotine product use and the public health impacts of different policies.  By achieving these aims, we will strengthen capacity in Guatemala and Mexico for conducting observational, experimental, and simulation research on ENDS, in order to inform the development of best practices for ENDS policies. The project will build upon research team members' longstanding and fundamental role in tobacco research capacity building across Latin America, so that sound public health policies can be developed to address ENDS and other emerging challenges to tobacco control in the region. 1"
"9516399","Project Summary Mammals, including humans, cannot regrow lost or damaged body parts. Echinoderms, with whom mammals share a deep common ancestor, can quickly and ef?ciently regenerate numerous body parts including muscular, skeletal, soft, and nervous tissues of appendages and internal organs. The ability of echinoderms to regenerate makes these animals particularly attractive for research in regenerative medicine. However, studies of regeneration in echinoderms has lagged behind other model systems due to the lack of functional genomic tools.  Thus our overarching goal is to develop echinoderm model systems for regenerative medicine. To this end, the ?rst aim of this proposal is to ?nish and annotate the genomes of two echinoderm species that have served as proven models for studies of regeneration, including the sea cucumber, Sclerodactyla briareus, and the brittle star, Ophioderma brevispinum. Taken together, these organ- isms exhibit a broad spectrum of regenerative phenomena ranging from morphallactic remodeling through transdifferentiation of the existing tissues, to rapid epimorphic terminal growth. In particular, both animals can regrow their central nervous system.  The second aim of our proposal is to adapt modern techniques of functional genomics to studies of adult echinoderm tissues. One sub-Aim here is to be able to experimentally regulate expression of genes of interest in vivo in regenerating animals. The focus of this sub-Aim will be electroporation and viral vector-based delivery of expression constructs into adult echinoderm tissues. Another sub-Aim is to use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology in adult echinoderm tissues in vivo. In order to as- sess the ef?ciency of these functional genomic tools, we will use them to perturb transcription factors that are key regulators of echinoderm neurogenesis. Suppression of expression of these transcription factors is therefore expected to produce a clear phenotype by impairing neural regeneration in both species. The completion of the proposed project will lead to establishment of genomic resources to probe the functional role of known developmental genes, as well as of novel regeneration-associated genes identi?ed in recent high-throughput expression studies, in the spontaneously regenerating cen- tral nervous system. This, in turn, will yield novel insights into the mechanisms of post-traumatic neurogenesis and inform the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat the poorly regener- ating neural injuries in human patients.  The research agenda of the proposed project provides a wealth of opportunities. Many of our un- dergraduate and graduate students are the ?rst in their families to have higher education opportunities and these students include many from historically under-represented minority groups."
"9498099","PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma continues to represent a major global public health problem resulting in significant disability and resource utilization. Most asthma is diagnosed before the age of six years and is preceded by episodes of troublesome lung symptoms ? wheezing, in the years after birth. Asthma is a complex disease with both genetic and environmental exposures contributing to its development: ORMDL3 and FADS are well-replicated asthma genes while vitamin D2-5 and n-3 polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs)6 have recently been identified as important prenatal risk factors for asthma. Despite the identification of these risk factors, a complete mechanistic understanding of how these exposures and genes operate together to impact asthma development remains unknown. Metabolomic profiling has the distinct advantage of being a marker that reflects the cumulative sum of past and current environmental and genetic exposures leading to the disease. Our preliminary metabolomics work has successfully identified associations between prenatal exposures (Vitamin D, n-3 PUFAs), asthma genes (ORMDL3 and FADS), and metabolites, thereby providing a direct mechanistic connection of how these risk variants may operate together to influence disease development. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the sphingolipid and eicosanoid pathways are important in asthma pathogenesis and may enlighten the mechanisms through which asthma genes (e.g. ORMDL3, FADS) and prenatal early life exposures (vitamin D and n-3 PUFAs) operate to cause or prevent asthma. For this proposal, we will capitalize on two randomized clinical trials with analogous study design and follow-up strategies ? Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Copenhagen Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC2010). Together these studies showed that prenatal vitamin D and n-3 PUFAs in supplementation reduce the risk of persistent wheeze/asthma in the first 3 years of life by 23% (p<0.01) and 32%6 (p=0.035) respectively. In this proposal we will: 1) Assess the effect of the maternal metabolome and prenatal exposures on the child metabolome; 2) Study the relationship between metabolites in the sphingolipid pathway, the ORMDL3 risk variant, and prenatal vitamin D supplementation on asthma risk; 3) Study the relationship between pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, genetic variants in FADS, and prenatal n-3 PUFA supplementation on asthma risk. Findings from this important study will have great public health importance in elucidating mechanisms involved in the development of asthma in children and could lead to preventive strategies against asthma in childhood."
"9478862","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ataxia-Telangiectasia (AT) is an incurable childhood disorder characterized by accelerated aging and progressive cerebellum degeneration causing several disabilities. Despite the discovery of causative mutations in the gene ATM (AT-mutated), its unknown pathogenic mechanism makes developing a treatment extremely difficult. It is known that ATM senses DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and triggers downstream repair pathways including cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. The lack of proper DSB repair due to the inherited ATM mutation in AT is thought to lead to the accumulation of unrepaired DSBs and increase genomic instability such as genomic rearrangement and aneuploidy. However, it is unclear how abnormal DSB repair relates to genomic instability and how the genomic instability impacts pathogenicity. Recent studies have reported frequent retrotransposition of transposable elements (TEs) in engineered ATM-deficient cells, increased DNA copies of TEs in AT patient brains, and abnormal expression of satellite repeats in DSB repair defective cells. Along with our published and unpublished data, these suggest a hypothesis that repeat aberrations may be a frequent form of genomic instability and pathogenic in AT. Our published single-neuron analysis showed that somatic retrotransposition occurred in neuronal progenitors and it created low-level somatic mosaicism in normal human brain. This suggests hypotheses that 1) neurons in AT patients may have a mixed population of somatic mutations occurring at different time points during development, and 2) late mutations present in a limited number of neurons may be critical determinants of cell death. Because those rare mutations cannot be detected with typical pooled-cell analysis, we propose to analyze genomes of individual neurons. However, the single-cell genomic approaches need to address significant technical challenges introduced by the whole genome amplification process necessary in current single-cell sequencing techniques. Thus, with a development of novel computational methods, we will characterize somatic mutations leading to multiple forms of genomic instability, including repeat aberration, in AT and assess their functional impact to neurodegeneration."
"9624895","Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. These products are now among the most popular dietary supplements with consumers. However, because traditional probiotic use has relied on dairy carrier matrices, the impact and equivalency of probiotics in dietary supplement formats are not well understood. This Administrative Supplement proposal is affiliated with my R01 project (1R01HD088428-01A1) investigating the efficacy and safety of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (B. lactis) BB-12 (BB-12) in preventing pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Although prevention of AAD is one of the most common indications for probiotic treatment, the efficacy of many probiotic products used for AAD is not supported by rigorous independent research. In the R01 human study, patients will consume BB-12 in yogurt during antibiotic treatment and will be observed for the frequency and duration of diarrhea and adverse outcomes. A secondary hypothesis of the R01 is that administration of antibiotics will alter the gut microbiome and that BB-12 in yogurt will mitigate the disturbance that antibiotics might cause. However, because this is a human study, it is difficult to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind BB-12 effects in the gut and to involve costly comparisons of different carrier matrices. Therefore, this supplement will use a mouse model to address whether BB-12 consumed in yogurt is more efficacious than when given as a dietary supplement. By examining for changes to the fecal microbiota and intestinal environment following antibiotic and probiotic treatment, we will begin to elucidate the specific molecular mechanisms by which probiotics can reduce the risk for AAD. Primary Aim: To quantify colonic SCFA levels in mice receiving antibiotics alone or in combination with BB-12 in yogurt or supplement (powder) format. Secondary Aim: To assess the composition of the intestinal microbiota in mice using 16S rRNA profiling before, during, and after antibiotic consumption in mice receiving antibiotics alone or in combination with BB-12 in either yogurt or supplement (powder) format. Tertiary Aim: To assess the level of SCFA sensing in intestinal tissues in mice receiving antibiotics alone or in combination with BB-12 in either yogurt or supplement (powder) format. Primary Hypothesis: Administration of BB-12 in yogurt is more effective than capsule format at mitigating antibiotic-induced changes to the gut microbiome to prevent the development of AAD. Objective: To better understand probiotic carrier format in the prevention of AAD. Clinically, probiotics have been shown to significantly prevent AAD, but the mechanistic basis for the best mode of delivery to the digestive tract is unclear. Our long-term goal is to determine the impact of BB-12 on a variety of gastrointestinal disease states and ages, through high-level independent research. To improve our interpretation of the outcomes of our current Phase II study (R01), we need to first perform more mechanistic studies to understand how BB-12 can prevent AAD in either yogurt or dietary supplement format."
"9624112","Contact PD/PI: KONSTAN, MICHAEL W. NRSA-Training-001 (145) NRSA TRAINING (TL1) SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Clinical/translational (C/T) scientists are increasingly important for cutting edge biomedical research that achieves ?bench to bedside to curbside? impact to address critical unmet health needs. To address these needs, translational workforce development (TWD) is needed to train C/T scientists with new skill sets. These skills will enable them to develop innovative strategies to address unmet health needs with effectiveness, efficiency and economy. Critical factors for success will be skills for transdisciplinary work, ability to work across the spectrum of laboratory science to clinical and public health research, and the ability to envision and design implementation of advances in clinical and community settings. To address these needs, the CWRU Clinical and Translational Scientist Training Program (CTSTP) will support C/T research training in both predoctoral and postdoctoral phases. These programs will be coordinated with our KL2 program to share training in team science, professional development activities and mentorship models. Together, these programs will provide a complete pipeline for training and development of C/T scientists. In the previous phase the CTSTP has focused on predoctoral training in combined degree programs, including expansion of physician-scientist MD-PhD training into C/T areas and the establishment of a novel nurse-scientist DNP-PhD training program. In the last 5 years the CTSTP has established two new PhD programs (Clinical Translational Science; Systems Biology and Bioinformatics) and has launched its expanded dual-degree training in Epidemiology, Biomedical Engineering, Nursing and other C/T areas. The CTSTP now proposes to further develop predoctoral programs and add a new post-doctoral research training program that will cover a broad range of clinical and research fields and encompass several applicant streams (post-doctoral training in the CTSTP PhD program in Clinical Translational Science, C/T research fellowships, and trainees in participating in research-track residencies/fellowships). The applicant streams will include physician-scientists, nurse- scientists, dental scientists and other C/T scientists. Predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees will participate in a core CTSTP curriculum with team science training, professional development activities and a rich set of C/T research training activities (including RCR and IDPs). Criteria for acceptance to the CTSTP include a strong academic record, commitment to a research-intensive career and evidence of skills for research. The program will be governed by an Advisory Board and a Steering Committee; these will include representatives of all participating institutions and programs. The CTSTP's robust mentor pool includes mentors with established training records and funding from NIH or other research grants. Participating institutions include CWRU, Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, MetroHealth Medical Center and the Louis Stokes Veteran's Administration Medical Center. These sites are well equipped for cutting edge C/T research. Project Summary/Abstract Page 1165 Contact PD/PI: KONSTAN, MICHAEL W. NRSA-Training-001 (145) BIBLIOGRAPHY & REFERENCES CITED 1.

"9495567","PROJECT SUMMARY  Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for approximately half of the heart failure population in the United States, and the primary chronic symptom experienced by these patients is severe exercise intolerance. Exercise intolerance is quantified as reduced peak oxygen uptake during exercise, and to date, therapies targeting central cardiac limitations have invariably failed to improve peak VO2, quality of life, or survival in HFpEF. Emerging evidence from our lab suggests reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity may contribute to exercise intolerance in HFpEF patients. However, the mechanisms responsible for peripheral metabolic inefficiency remain unclear. Reduced blood flow (oxygen delivery), and slowed oxygen uptake kinetics (O2 utilization), may be primary contributors to reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and result in the production of metabolites known to activate muscle afferent nerves and stimulate reflex increases in muscle sympathetic (vasoconstrictor) nervous system activity (MSNA). Elevated MSNA can in turn, result in further impairments in hemodynamic control during exercise. However, to date there have been no studies specifically investigating the contribution of peripheral vascular, metabolic, and neural impairments to reduced exercise capacity in HFpEF. The first goal of this proposal will be to identify impairments in peripheral vascular, metabolic, and sympathetic neural function in HFpEF. To accomplish this, we will measure the dynamic blood flow response (oxygen delivery) and oxygen uptake kinetics (oxygen utilization) during knee extensor (KE) exercise, as well as MSNA during exercise to characterize the contribution of peripheral abnormalities to exercise intolerance in HFpEF. The second goal will be to utilize small muscle mass KE training, specifically targeting these peripheral skeletal muscle deficiencies, to improve aerobic capacity and exercise tolerance in HFpEF. We will assess vascular, metabolic, and neural function before and after completing 8 weeks of single KE exercise training, in conjunction with measures of maximal aerobic capacity and functional capacity. The isolated KE training approach will minimize the central hemodynamic stress of whole body exercise, while simultaneously targeting skeletal muscle function to improve exercise tolerance in HFpEF. Importantly, this proposal will advance our understanding of the basic pathophysiology of exercise intolerance in HFpEF. Considering that vascular function, oxidative capacity, and a MSNA are independent predictors of mortality in heart failure patients, strategies aimed at improving these functional markers may have important implications for the treatment of HFpEF, a condition for which there are currently no known therapies to reduce morbidity and mortality."
"9437842","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: For over two decades, the annual cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality rate has been higher for women as compared to men, yet obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is less prevalent in women. Coronary angiography is the gold standard for diagnosing obstructive CAD and remains a cornerstone of modern CVD care, but it cannot identify diffuse atherosclerosis and small-vessel disease. These may contribute to adverse CVD events, including heart failure, from resultant coronary vasomotor dysfunction, microvascular disease, and myocardial ischemia. Thus, even patients without significant obstructive CAD may be at high risk for adverse CVD events. CANDIDATE: Dr. Viviany Taqueti is an early career cardiologist, imager, and physician- scientist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA with a longstanding interest in endothelial and cardiomyocyte function and vascular inflammation. Her goal is to become an independent clinical investigator and leader in leveraging imaging data from a breadth of study designs to better define ischemic heart disease phenotypes and pathophysiology, ultimately to inform future therapeutic trials. This K23 application presents a comprehensive training plan including structured mentorship (with Dr. Marcelo Di Carli), a well-developed advisory committee (with Drs. Paul Ridker, Scott Solomon, and Bairey Merz), and a tailored didactic curriculum in advanced statistical and imaging methods, which together will provide Dr. Taqueti with the skills necessary to achieve this goal and transition into a successful independent investigator. ENVIRONMENT: The Cardiovascular Imaging Group at Brigham and Women's Hospital offers exposure to a diverse range of faculty members in the Departments of Radiology and Medicine who are engaged in basic, clinical, and population health research, and provides a unique environment for cross-departmental collaborations. BWH is a world- class center for myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and noninvasive quantification of coronary flow reserve (CFR). Importantly, its leadership is dedicated to protecting Dr. Taqueti's time for research and career development activities, and to foster her development as an independent translational investigator. Dr. Taqueti will also have access to resources at the Harvard Catalyst Clinical and Translational Science Center and the Harvard School of Public Health. RESEARCH SUMMARY: The objective of this proposal is to utilize a novel, noninvasive imaging method of quantifying coronary blood flow to understand mechanisms of CVD outcomes in women and men across the anatomic CAD spectrum. Coronary flow reserve (CFR), calculated as the ratio of hyperemic to rest myocardial blood flow as quantified noninvasively by positron emission tomography (PET), is an integrated noninvasive measure of large and small vessel CAD and myocardial ischemia, and identifies patients at risk for CVD death independently of angiographic disease severity. This is especially important for women, in who diffuse atherosclerosis and microvascular dysfunction likely contribute to CVD outcomes, especially heart failure, but are often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Yet the exact relationship between impaired CFR and adverse CVD outcomes, particularly in the absence of obstructive CAD, is not well understood. Our central hypothesis is that excess CVD risk in women relative to men referred for coronary angiography is associated with impaired CFR independently of obstructive CAD, and that this increased risk may be mediated by increased myocardial strain and increased inflammation. Dr. Taqueti will apply state of the art analyses to two unique and complementary populations: a registry of patients undergoing PET myocardial perfusion for clinical evaluation of suspected CAD [CFR Registry]; and subjects from the Coronary Flow Reserve to Assess Cardiovascular Inflammation trial [CIRT-CFR], an ancillary study of the NHLBI sponsored multicenter Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial (CIRT) which will test whether reducing inflammation in stable CAD patients improves CFR. SPECIFIC AIMS: The following specific aims are proposed: (1) To identify the relationship between sex, CFR and angiographic disease severity in patients with suspected CAD [CFR Registry]; (2) To define the extent to which CVD risk in women relative to men is associated with impaired CFR, not obstructive CAD [CFR Registry]; and (3) To define the relationship between CFR, myocardial strain, and inflammation in women and men with stable CAD [CIRT-CFR]. By clarifying definitively the contribution of CFR to hidden CVD risk in women and men with varying levels of anatomic CAD, Dr. Taqueti will acquire the requisite experience and preliminary data for future R01-level studies employing this functional measure to select subjects for novel preventative and therapeutic interventions, including systemic therapy with anti-inflammatory, extreme lipid- lowering, and neurohormonal modulating agents. The proposed translational aims will help to define a new paradigm of ischemic heart disease with implications for diagnosis, risk stratification, and development of novel management strategies for a common, poorly recognized clinical problem with a disproportionate impact on women's health, an NIH strategic priority."
"9481241","Project Summary In this application, we propose a week-long summer workshop and series of online modules to build the capacity of social and behavioral scientists to understand and conduct genomic research using NIH-funded resources, such as the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Our proposed R25 Research Education Program will open up the opportunity for social science researchers using these data to integrate genomics into their research by 1) offering a training workshop with a hands-on lab component annually at the University of Michigan, 2) creating a series of online tutorials that can augment the workshop or serve as stand-alone exercises, and 3) linking these custom tools with resources already available on the web. The course and supporting material will focus on providing hands-on training for researchers working at the intersection of genetics and social science research, using HRS data as a model, but broadly applicable to any social science study with genetic data. We will cover a biological overview of genetics and functional genomics as well as an introduction to current statistical and genetic methods for studying human complex traits. Hands-on analysis will be an integral part of the course and will utilize a classroom of networked computers with tutorial versions of the HRS core survey data and HRS genetic data files. Through discussion and by example we will focus on the unique aspects of analyzing genetic data in combination with social science data and will facilitate collaboration across disciplines among the workshop attendees and project investigators."

However, mechanisms accounting for the links between long-term stress exposure, hypertension and CHD remain unclear. Cardiovascular reactivity is hypothesized to be a major contender as it predicts increased risk of cardiac events and mortality, especially among people with hypertension. According to existing theories of racial health disparities, stress, and social relations, racial health disparities are due to variations in long-term exposure to stress and stress reactivity (biological, psychological, behavioral) and those race differences are moderated by social relations and age. In response to the FOA Aging Research on Stress and Resilience to Address Health Disparities in the United States (RFA-AG-16-022), the present study seeks to understand how long-term stress exposure links with stress reactivity among AA and EA adults. This study capitalizes the existing longitudinal Social Relations and Health Study (SRS),a regionally representative panel sample of AA and EA individuals from the Detroit metropolitan area who began participating in 1992 (ages 13 to 93) and completed the third wave in 2015 (ages 30 to 95). The proposed study will incorporates two new studies of short-term stress reactivity: 1) a daily stress study and 2) a laboratory stress study. The daily stress study will target 300 participants (50% AA; 50%EA) and will incorporate a 4 day experience sampling study of self-reported stress exposure and reactivity (psychological, behavioral) as well as two ambulatory monitoring devices to assess biological reactivity: 1) a newly developed non-invasive continuous monitoring ring device that provides estimates of vascular resistance and 2) a watch that assesses heart rate, heart rate variability, and galvanic skin response. In the laboratory study we will examine reactivity to standard laboratory stressors among a sample of 50 AA and 50 EA respondents who completed the daily stress study to examine more thoroughly their physiological responses to stress with the same ambulatory ring and watch as well as established continuous monitors. The proposed research addresses three aims: 1) Test links between long- term stress exposure and short-term stress reactivity among EA and AA adults, 2) Examine age differences in long-term stress exposure and short-term reactivity by race, and 3) Determine how long-term social relationships moderate individual differences in stress exposure and reactivity. This project has public health significance as it will identify individuals who are more reactive to stress and the immediate as well as lifespan factors that are associated with greater stress reactivity. A more nuanced understanding of the psychological and biological implications of stress among diverse populations will lead to the development and testing of interventions for reducing stress, later health problems, and health disparities."
"9613964","Summary/Abstract:  Parkinson?s disease (PD) is the second most common late-onset neurodegenerative disease with the largest relative increase in mortality rates among all neurological disorders. PD is traditionally considered a motor disorder, characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the SNpc, and the presence of fibrillar cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. However, a more global perspective on the PD is developing, motivated by pathological and clinical findings that extend beyond the basal ganglia. In particular, the majority of PD patients meet criteria for a secondary diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment that progresses dementia, a significant contributor to disease morbidity and mortality. The emerging view is that the abnormalities in ?-synuclein (?S) may be responsible for motor and non-motor symptoms in PD and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Significantly, we recently found that abnormal ?S can cause post-synaptic deficits in vitro and in vivo via a microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) dependent mechanism. In this proposal, we will directly determine the following hypothesis: 1) Pathogenic ?S species produce cognitive decline tau-dependent post-synaptic mechanisms and 2) MAPT-dependent postsynaptic deficits caused by exogenous ?S fibrils/oligomers contribute to cognitive deficits in sporadic PD and DLB. To determine the mechanistic basis for cognitive deficits in ?-synucleinopathy, we propose following aims: 1) Determine whether tau is required for ?S dependent synaptic and cognitive deficits; 2) Determine if mutant ?S-dependent AMPAR deficits and memory deficits are caused by multiple pathways; 3) Determine whether hippocampal ?S pathology and somatodendritic tau mislocalization correlates with dementia in PD; 4) Determine if exogenous pathogenic ?S induces pre- and/or post-synaptic deficits; and 5) Determine if pathogenic ?S induces defects in synaptic plasticity and memory in a tau dependent manner."
"9524579","Project Summary/Abstract  Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) exert strong disease-modifying activity in various models of heart failure. In the original funding period of this R01, we tested, and ended up supporting, the hypothesis that the therapeutic benefits of CDCs are mediated by exosomes (nanosized lipid bilayer vesicles that are enriched in noncoding RNAs). Indeed, the concepts first articulated here for heart-derived cells have since been generalized to virtually all other cell types under development as therapeutic candidates for heart failure; even pluripotent stem cell products are now acknowledged to act largely via exosome secretion. We and others have also established that many, if not most, of the effects of exosomes are mediated by their RNA contents, specifically miRs and other noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). The emerging paradigm is as follows: CDCs secrete exosomes which transfer payloads into target cells, inducing transcriptomic and phenotypic changes that underlie the benefits of CDC therapy. As a corollary of our work to define mechanisms of action of cardiac cell therapy, we have come to realize that exosomes are themselves viable next-generation therapeutic candidates. Potential advantages over the parent cells include product stability, immune tolerability, and the ability to achieve efficacy with simple intravenous (IV) administration. The major focus of the first funding period was on unaltered exosomes produced by primary wild type CDCs. In this competitive renewal, we will manipulate exosomes both by alterations of the parent cell and directly, after isolation. Such manipulation can increase potency as well as improve targeting. Technological and conceptual advances now make it possible to envision a novel, stable, cell-free therapeutic agent that can effectively target heart failure when delivered IV. Here we propose to develop trenchant methods to assess exosome biodistribution, to enhance exosome targeting and potency, and to immortalize CDCs as a stable source of therapeutic exosomes. The specific aims are designed to answer four inter-connected questions: What is the biodistribution of exosomes when delivered IV (Aim 1)? Can we facilitate tissue/cell-directed targeting of exosomes when delivered IV (Aim 2)? Can we immortalize CDCs to generate therapeutically potent and consistent exosomes (Aim 3)? Combining the insights from these various approaches, can we create and select a therapeutic candidate of optimal efficacy for modifying heart failure in vivo after IV administration (Aim 4)? We will create useful models (fate-mapping mTmG mice) and methods (exosomal Cre loading, targeting strategies, CDC immortalization) which will advance our mechanistic understanding of exosome biology. Meanwhile, the proposed work constitutes an important translational step towards the development of exosomes as off-the- shelf therapeutic candidates. CDCs are already in advanced clinical testing, but living cells have limitations relative to cell-free products. Thus, our proposal, focusing on genetically-enhanced exosomes (as cell-free derivatives of immortalized CDCs), opens up new treatment options for heart failure."
"9686176","Summary:  Urinary incontinence (UI) has a profound negative impact on quality of life and associated with increased risk of hospitalizations or nursing home admissions in older women. UI leads to functional decline and mobility limitations. More importantly, mobility limitations are predictive of UI onset and severity. The bidirectional relation between UI and mobility limitations in older women suggests common causal mechanisms with generalized poor muscle function contributing to the development of UI and mobility limitations. The current UI treatments in older women miss the critical components to improve mobility in older women suffering from UI. Therefore, older women with UI and mobility limitations may not have optimal improvement of their symptoms, especially in the context of maintenance of functional independence.  Our long-term goal is 1) to improve quality of life in older women suffering from UI and mobility limitations that have common etiological causes and 2) to evaluate the role and contribution of atrophy and fat infiltration in pelvic floor (levator ani, internal obturator) and lower body (gluteus maximus, medius, minimus) muscles as causal mechanisms in the development of UI and mobility limitations in older women. Our central hypothesis is that a muscle strengthening and aerobic conditioning rehabilitation program designed to improve endurance and lower body mobility combined with the strengthening of pelvic floor muscles will reduce pelvic floor and lower body muscle dysfunction and weakness, enhance strength and endurance, and improve continence and mobility in older women. The rationale for the proposed research is that a multimodal rehabilitation program targeting to improve physical function through strengthening pelvic floor and lower body muscles will have greater efficacy in reducing UI symptoms and improving physical function than current PFMT alone in older women suffering from UI. We will test our hypothesis with a randomized controlled trial in older women with symptomatic UI with the following aims: 1) Evaluate UI symptoms and mobility limitations after a three-month multimodal strengthening and aerobic conditioning rehabilitation program combined with PFMT as compared to current standard PFMT alone in women ? 70 years with symptomatic UI; 2) Examine changes in the quality of pelvic floor and gluteal muscles before and after a three-month multimodal strengthening and aerobic conditioning rehabilitation program combined with PFMT and PFMT alone based on muscle Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The primary outcome in the study is the reduction UI episodes after the intervention.  This proposal is innovative because we propose a multimodal rehabilitation program that will treat both UI and mobility as well as new biomarkers in lower body muscles dysfunction in older women with UI and mobility limitations. The study will allow the PI to transition to independent research to improve quality of live in older women with UI by decreasing UI and mobility limitations. The knowledge obtained from this research will enhance our fundamental understanding in the development of UI and mobility limitations. This proposal will fulfill the Institute of Medicine goals to increase clinical research that will lead to improved care and more effective treatments for older patients with multiple medical conditions."
"9538076","Abstract Miscarriage causes termination of 15-20% of implantation-confirmed pregnancies. Majority of miscarriages occur during the first trimester of pregnancy and defective development of trophoblast cell lineage, which assures embryo implantation and placentation, is one of the leading causes for early pregnancy loss. However, we have a poor understanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate trophoblast progenitor differentiation and function in early post-implantation embryos. Our published and preliminary studies establish that GATA family transcription factors, GATA2 and GATA3, are conserved in trophoblast progenitors across mammalian species and are critical regulators to specify and maintain trophoblast lineage during early mammalian development. The overarching goal of this proposal is to further define GATA factor- mediated transcriptional mechanisms that regulate development and proper function of specialized trophoblast cell types at the maternal-fetal interface.  Three specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will study a Gata2/Gata3 double knockout (Gata2-/-/Gata3-/-) mouse model and GATA-mutated rat models to test the hypothesis that cell-autonomous functions of GATA factors are essential to establish differentiated cell-fate in the trophoblast progenitors of a developing placenta.  Aim 2 will perform global gene expression analyses in primary trophoblast cells of developing placenta with or without GATA mutations. The goal is to test the hypothesis that GATA factors establish differential transcriptional circuitry in trophoblast stem/progenitor cells vs. differentiated trophoblast cells, thereby specifying trophoblast subtypes.  Aim 3 will study GATA-mediated regulation of gene expression in human trophoblast cells. The objective is to test the hypothesis that GATA2 and GATA3 are essential to maintain a core TSC-specific transcriptional program in trophoblast progenitors across mammalian species, including human villous cytotrophoblast (vCTB) progenitors of a human placenta. We will also test whether pregnancy associated disorders involve altered GATA factor-mediated gene regulation in vCTBs."
"9541230","Tumor resistance to radiation therapy remains a significant obstacle to long-term cancer patient survival, especially for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a cancer type with poor long-term outcomes (less than 50% advanced stage five-year survival). To overcome the problem of radiation resistance, radiation therapy is being combined with radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies. Prediction of an individual?s sensitivity to radiation and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies prior to treatment would improve the development of personalized treatment plans for cancer patients. Efforts are being made to create systems biology models of cancer cells for biomarker discovery and prediction of treatment response; however, due to methodological shortcomings, failure to integrate multi-omic data on a genome-scale, and lack of specificity to individual patient tumors, these predictive models have yet to be implemented clinically. To address these needs, the objective of this project is to develop a personalized systems biology modeling platform for individualized prediction of HNSCC patient tumor response to radiation and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies. These models will be created by first integrating comprehensive biological data on individual patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This approach will allow for the comparison of metabolic, signaling, and phenotypic signatures between radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant patient tumors. By then integrating the mechanisms of action of radiation therapy and radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies into the modeling framework, the response to particular chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in individual radiation- resistant patient tumors can be predicted. Machine learning classifiers will be developed from TCGA patient data and model predictions to determine which biological and clinical factors are most predictive of radiation sensitivity and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy success. It is hypothesized that differential response to chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in radiation-resistant HNSCC tumors is accomplished through redox metabolism and signaling, and components of redox biology within the modeling framework will significantly enrich the list of predictive biomarkers for combination therapy success. Although the focus of this project will be on HNSCC, this systems biology modeling approach will be applicable to any cancer type. The outcomes of this project will be a reduced set of clinically-measurable biomarkers for accurate prediction of HNSCC patient response to radiation therapy and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies, as well as a precision medicine platform to test clinically relevant therapeutic strategies. This project is innovative because it combines multi-omic cancer patient data with state-of-the-art systems biology modeling techniques to investigate the biological mechanisms of radiation resistance, as well as to predict chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy response in individual radiation-resistant patients."
"9589211","Project Summary: Several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, as well as the polyglutamine expansion diseases, result from protein misfolding and accumulation due to genetic and/or environmental causes. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset, inherited neuromuscular disease that is caused by polyglutamine expansion within the androgen receptor (AR); it is related to other neurodegenerative diseases caused by polyglutamine expansion, including Huntington's disease and several spinocerebellar ataxias. Although the precise pathways leading to neuronal dysfunction and death are unknown, the evaluation of transgenic mouse and cell models of these diseases has yielded mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis. SBMA stands apart from other polyglutamine diseases in that its onset and progression are dependent on AR androgenic ligands. Our cell and mouse models of SBMA reproduce the androgen- and polyglutamine-dependent nuclear AR aggregation seen in patients, as well as its consequent toxicity, making these models highly useful for the analysis of the mechanistic basis for upstream events involved in AR toxicity. Our long-term objectives are to use these models to develop a mechanistic understanding of hormone-dependent, polyglutamine-expanded AR toxicity. A growing body of evidence suggests that long polyQ tracts cause cellular dysfunction and ultimately cell death, at least in part by dysregulating protein-protein interactions that sustain normal cellular function. We have utilized a quantitative proteomics approach to identify changes in the AR protein interaction network caused by polyQ expansion in a cell model, and identified several protein candidates that may be involved in polyQ-expanded AR pathogenicity. Our preliminary studies on one of the identified interactors, USP7 (a preferential interactor with polyQ-expanded AR), reveals a role for USP7 in SBMA. We propose here to 1) carry out additional interactome screens in spinal cord and muscle tissues of a validated mouse model of SBMA, 2) investigate the roles of the other differentially interacting proteins identified in our initial screen, and 3) continue our mechanistic studies of the role of USP7 in SBMA. We anticipate that results from these studies will lead us to a deeper understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of SBMA, and will yield novel pathways amenable to therapeutic modulation for SBMA."
"9468936","This F32 proposal outlines research objectives to investigate the early gene expression regulation  of bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) cloned embryos, and improve their developmental  potential by harnessing our knowledge of IVF bovine preimplantation development. Based on several  published reports, including my own work, my hypothesis is that failed embryonic genome activation  (EGA) is the rate-limiting step negatively impacting the robust development of cloned animals.  Because many EGA activated genes are involved in epigenetic reprogramming embryonic chromatin,  failure to appropriately turn on these genes leads to developmental dysregulation and failure,  often manifested much later in gestation. Building upon both our published work, showing that DUX transcription factors (TF) are the master  regulators of gene expression at the egg-to-embryo transition, and utilizing my extensive  unpublished preliminary data laying the ground work for our hypothesis in the bovine system, I will  first address this problem using cutting-edge genomic, epigenomic, and embryological methods.  First, I will test whether the putative enhancer regions I identified in IVF bovine embryos show  stage-specific transcriptional activity in vivo. I will also dissect which TFs the putative  enhancer regions are responsive to using a cellular system. Then I will identify open chromatin  regions in bovine SCNT embryos and compare them to the high-quality IVF embryo open chromatin maps  I have previously generated. This will help me understand how much of the SCNT developmental  phenotype is caused by failure to activate EGA chromatin or failure to decommission somatic cell  open chromatin. Finally, I will use our data that cow DUXC is a major activator of bovine EGA to  test our hypothesis that DUXC deficiency can be overcome by ectopically expressing DUXC in SCNT  embryos and that this will increase the efficiency of SCNT. With significance for human assisted  reproductive technologies, development of large animal models of human embryogenesis, agricultural  significance of cloning, and ecological impacts of endangered species preservation through SCNT,  this work integrates innovative strategies to impact multiple fields."
"9504280","High grade gliomas, especially glioblastoma (GBM), have exceptionally poor prognosis and cancers that metastasize to the brain, for example from the lung and breast are associated with advanced disease. Notably, our Multi-PI research team has discovered that casein kinase-1 delta and epsilon (CK1?, CK1?) are new therapeutic targets for GBM. This discovery originated from a small molecule screen by the Roush lab at Scripps Florida, who identified a class of highly potent and selective dual inhibitors of CK1? and CK1?. Further studies by the Duckett lab then showed that; (i) 11% of GBMs and 36% of all breast cancers have amplified CSNK1D; (ii) GBM and certain breast cancers including those that metastasize to the brain express elevated levels of CK1? and Wnt/?-catenin transcription targets; (iii) brain metastatic lung adenocarcinoma cells that express CK1? and CK1? and are highly sensitive to our inhibitors; (iv) dual CK1?/? inhibitors induce rapid apoptosis of GBM, breast and lung cancer cells ex vivo, and tumor regression in vivo, but are not toxic to normal human epithelial cells and can be administered daily to mice long term without observable adverse side effects; (v) CK1?/? regulates expression of key factors involved in tumor cell invasion, (vi) CK1?/? regulates expression of essential DNA damage repair genes, and (vii) inhibition of CK1?/? augments the killing effects of IR, DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents and PARP inhibitors. Collectively these findings support the premise that CK1? is an exploitable target of GBM and other refractory cancers that metastasize to the brain. In Aim 1, using already established critical path assays, a validated research operating plan (ROP), an iterative medicinal chemistry approach based on a multi-parameter optimization strategy augmented by drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies, we will develop and deliver optimized dual and isoform selective brain penetrant CK1? and CK1? inhibitors. Efficacy and safety of these inhibitors will be tested in our intracranial human xenograft models in mice. In Aim 2, we will (i) identify the full cast of invasion related protein(s) modified by CK1? activity, (ii) elucidate how CK1? contributes to GBM tumor cell diffusion; (iii) determine how and at which stage CK1? control aspects of the metastasis cascade from the periphery to the brain, and (iv) elucidate the role of CK1? in regulating a glioma stem cell-like state. In Aim 3, we will determine; (i) the MOA of DNA damage- induced CK1?-regulation of genome maintenance pathways in GBM, and (ii) define the safety margin associated with our lead CK1?/? inhibitor and the most efficacious combination for improved treatment in GBM."

"9470890","PROJECT SUMMARY: LIGAND DISCOVERY PROJECT The development of strategies, tools and infrastructure for the discovery of novel microbial metabolism represents a major challenge to the post-genomic biological community. The functional properties of solute binding proteins (SBPs) make them particularly amenable to large-scale functional annotation, as the first step in a catabolic pathway is frequently the passage of a metabolite across the cellular membrane by SBP- dependent transport machinery. The ability to identify the initial reactant (or a closely related molecule) for a catabolic pathway provides an immediate toe-hold by placing significant constraints on the regions of chemical space which need to be considered and, in conjunction with knowledge of colocalized and coregulated genes, begins to define details of the in vivo biochemical transformations operating within the metabolic pathway. Accordingly, a central goal of this project is to evaluate the wide-spread utility of targeting SBPs and related proteins for initial functional insight. We have implemented a high-throughput differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assay for the interrogation of ligands/metabolite libraries carefully constituted for specific subfamilies of SBPs. In parallel, high resolution structural characterization of SBP-ligand complexes will reveal the determinants responsible for ligand recognition, and delineate ?specificity boundaries? required for confidently defining the limits of annotation transfer. The Ligand Discovery Project will specifically examine SBPs involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism and expand this strategy to include the ligand-responsive transcriptional regulators which combine an SBP-like domain with a DNA-binding module. Finally, this strategy will be applied to the microbes that compose the human gut microbiome. Combining experimentally defined SBP ligands and high resolution structural information with genome neighborhood networks (Metabolism Project) and additional insights gleaned from computational approaches (Modeling Project) results in a powerful multidisciplinary strategy for the discovery of new metabolism. When systematically applied to the human gut microbiome, these approaches will result in the discovery of new metabolic pathways important for communication between members of the gut community, communication between the gut microbes and the human host, and in particular will expand our understanding of the impact of microbial metabolism on human health and disease. Most importantly, the strategies and tools described in this application will enable the discovery of novel metabolism by the entire community."

"9477504","Project 1: Modeling tumor evolution in mouse and organoid models  ABSTRACT   Clonal evolution and tumor heterogeneity are believed to play key roles in generating patient-specific  variations in tumor phenotype during cancer progression and in the emergence of treatment resistance.  Although clonal evolution has been well studied in hematological malignancies, it is less understood in solid  tumors, in part due to difficulties in performing longitudinal assessments. To overcome many of the challenges  of studying clonal evolution in solid tumors, we developed a reductionist model system for investigating clonal  histories and demonstrated its feasibility in prostate cancer. In preliminary studies, we show that multi-color  lineage-tracing can be employed to follow clonal fates in genetically-engineered mouse models of prostate  cancer, and that a novel organoid culture approach can be used for longitudinal assessments of clonal growth  and response to therapy. These approaches will be used together with single-cell transcriptome analyses of  tumor heterogeneity and sophisticated mathematical approaches that will allow us to investigate whether  prostate cancer follows a linear or branched evolutionary pattern.   We will now investigate clonal evolution in prostate cancer by pursuing three specific aims: 1) investigation  of clonal evolution during tissue homeostasis and regeneration by employing multi-color lineage-tracing and  organoid culture to follow clonal histories; 2) analysis of clonal evolution during cancer progression using multi-  color lineage-tracing in mouse models of prostate cancer together with organoid culture for longitudinal  analyses, with data analyzed by single-cell transcriptomics and mathematical modeling; and 3) investigation of  the clonal response to therapy by longitudinal analyses of clonal evolution in organoid culture after drug  treatments. These studies will be greatly facilitated by the analyses of evolutionary moduli spaces and  topological data analyses performed in collaboration with the Mathematical Core, as well as by interactions  with Projects 2 and 3. Taken together, our proposed studies will provide robust mathematical analyses of a  reductionist model of clonal evolution for solid tumors, providing insights into the emergence of resistance to  therapy."
"9472999","SUMMARY Dysfunctional mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are hypothesized to drive aging phenotypes, but the mechanisms by which these age-related defects act are poorly understood. This proposal focuses on the mechanisms linking mitochondrial dysfunction, including mtDNA mutations, to aging phenotypes through the pleiotropic stress response known as cellular senescence. The senescence response is a permanent arrest of cell proliferation, accompanied by phenotypic changes, including the development of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP entails the secretion of a myriad of pro- inflammatory cytokines, angiogenic factors, growth factors and proteases. However, in the case of mitochondrial dysfunction, the secretory and mitotic arrest phenotypes can be partially uncoupled. Depending on the extracellular environment, mitochondrial dysfunction can either drive SASP-like secretion in the absence of mitotic arrest, or can drive a senescence arrest that is notably free of SASP inflammatory components. We propose to use cultured human and mouse cells, and mouse models to critically determine the role of cellular senescence phenotypes in mitochondrial dysfunction-induced aging. Our specific aims are designed to answer the following questions: How does loss of mitochondrial function drive cellular senescence phenotypes? Does the accumulation of mtDNA mutations drive cellular senescence phenotypes in a mouse model, and can the elimination of senescent cells prevent mtDNA-induced tissue dysfunction? Finally, is mitochondrial dysfunction an inducer of cellular senescence phenotypes during normal aging and does a mouse model of delayed aging accumulate fewer senescent cells with age? If successful, our proposed experiments will provide an important link between mitochondrial function and physiological manifestations of aging. In addition to generating important basic knowledge, the experiments will also provide a new targets (dysfunctional mitochondria and senescent cells) for the development of potential interventions into aging and age-related diseases."
"9473032","Expansion of functional pancreatic beta cell mass is a major therapeutic goal for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Glucose is a key physiological driver of adaptive beta cell mass expansion, promoting beta cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. We have been studying mechanisms of glucose-regulated gene expression for nearly two decades. In 2012 we found that carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP; Mlxipl) is required for glucose-stimulated beta cell proliferation in both rodent and human beta cells. That same year, our co-investigator (Dr. Mark Herman) discovered that ChREBP exists as 2 major isoforms. ChREBP? is the full-length form that is mostly cytoplasmic and repressed in low glucose. ChREBP? is a product of alternative splicing, with the nuclear export signals and the low glucose inhibitory domain removed. Consequently, ChREBP? is mostly nuclear, and is constitutively and potently active. ChREBP? transcription is induced by a powerful carbohydrate response element after activation of the glucose-responsive ChREBP?, creating a vigorous feed-forward loop (Fig. 1). Remarkably, in every system studied in detail, the induction of ChREBP? is the molecular engine that drives the major physiological effects of ChREBP. In adipose tissue or liver, induction of ChREBP? increases de novo lipogenesis and either increases or decreases insulin sensitivity, respectively.. In beta cells, we recently showed that the exponential induction of ChREBP? - from a nearly undetectable level to amounts comparable to ChREBP? - is required for glucose-stimulated proliferation. Strikingly, however, overexpression of ChREBP? in beta cells, as may happen with prolonged hyperglycemia or by ectopic viral expression, results in beta cell apoptosis. In stark contrast, overexpression of ChREBP? amplifies glucose-stimulated beta cell proliferation without cell death. Our overarching hypothesis is that the ratio of ChREBP? to ChREBP? abundance is critically important for beta cell function, both for beta cell mass expansion and, when dysregulated, as a mediator of glucose toxicity. We will test our hypothesis by performing the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine the effects of increasing or decreasing the abundance of ChREBP? specifically in beta cells on beta cell mass and glucose homeostasis; (2) Determine if exogenous expression of ChREBP? or ChREBP? in human islets improves or worsens islet transplantation outcomes; and (3) Determine how the ratio of ChREBP? to ChREBP? controls the fate of beta cells. This application uses novel tools that will provide an essential mechanistic understanding of transcriptional glucose sensing that will inform therapies to expand and protect beta cell mass."

"9476965","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The balance between hepatocyte life and death is regulated through multiple signaling pathways. Activation of  the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway represents an important and fundamental mechanism  through which hepatocyte function and longevity is achieved. Although propagation of the stress-responsive  MAPKs is critical for the promotion of both signals that confer hepatocyte life and death much less is  understood about the signals that inactivate the MAPKs in the liver and how these signals participate in the  progression of liver disease. The broad goal of this project is to define the role of the MAP kinase  phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) in the management of liver injury. Liver injury is often one of the early precipitating  events in the progression towards liver disaease that is often facilitated by chronic inflammation. We have  found that whole body MKP-1-deficient mice exhibit resistance to the development of non-alcoholic  steatohepatitis (NASH) and in response to injury are impaired in their ability to regenerate liver. We will test the  hypothesis that hepatic MKP-1 serves as an essential regulator of stress-responsive MAPK signaling in the  control of liver injury. In aim 1, we will use liver-specific MKP-1 knock-out mice to determine the contribution of  MKP-1 in the liver and macrophage in the progression of NASH. Aim 2 will focus on the observation that  hepatic MKP-1 is required for liver regeneration. We will will elucidate the mechanisms through which MKP-1  regulates liver regeneration by examining how it serves to control the expression of the hepatokine, interleukin  6. In aim 3, phosphoproteomic approaches will be employed to identify MKP-1-regulated MAPK substrates  involved in liver stress and repair. Hepatic MKP-1-regulated MAPK substrates will be characterized and tested  for their roles in liver stress-responsive signaling. These studies will be integrated with the analysis of MKP-1  and its identified regulatory MAPK substrates in various human settings of liver disease. The succesful  implementation of these studies will provide new insight in to the mechanisms the liver invokes in response to  injury and as such may reveal new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of liver disease."
"9584542","Project Summary/Abstract The use of implantable blood-contacting medical devices is always associated with the substantial risks of thrombosis and microbial infection, which greatly influence patient outcomes and health costs. The objective of this application is to create novel biomaterials through synthesis and development of new polyphosphazene polymers combined with surface texturing approach to improve hemocompatibility of biomaterials. The central hypothesis of the work states that  The fluorinated organic side groups linked to polyphosphazene backbone produce specific  chemical functionalities leading to unique biological properties. Further, a textured surface  modification approach additively or synergistically increases the efficiency in reducing platelet  adhesion/activation, plasma protein activation, and bacterial adhesion/biofilm formation, thereby  reducing thrombosis and microbial infections. To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims that involve development of new polyphosphazene materials, fabrication of the textured surface, and characterization of biological responses to materials. The new biostable elastomer, poly[bis(octafluoropentoxy) phosphazene] (OFP), is synthesized and a series of crosslinkable OFPs (X-OFP) will be further developed to improve the mechanical properties of materials. The materials will be fabricated as textured films bearing ordered arrays of pillars on surface. We will characterize surface properties of the materials by state-of-the-art surface analysis techniques (e.g., XPS, AFM, SEM, and TEM), and utilize a series of in-vitro tests to assess biological responses to the materials, related to thrombosis and microbial infection, including platelet adhesion/activation, plasma protein adsorption/activation, plasma coagulation, and pathogenic bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, as well as the cytocompatibility. These studies will demonstrate the feasibility of new polyphosphazene biomaterials for the use in blood-contacting medical devices and explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological responses to surface with the physical modification, thereby providing the route to design and fabricate new biomaterials with improved biological responses. Ultimately the application will optimize the synthesized polyphosphazene biomaterials bearing the surface topography at >99% efficiency in pillar yield. We expect that the reductions of platelet and bacterial adhesions will be larger than 90% and 99%, respectively, and the long term prevention of biofilm formation will be at least 28 d under shear, largely increasing the resistance to thrombosis and microbial infection compared to widely used polyurethane biomaterials. The successful completion of this application will provide a practical approach to improve the hemocompatibility of current biomaterials, eventually for clinical use to improve patient care and incur cost-savings."
"9583275","Ehrlichia chaffeensis (Ech) is an obligatory intracellular bacterium that causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), an emerging life-threatening infectious disease in the US. Based on our discoveries of a novel Ech component and host signaling pathways required for obligatory intracellular infection viz. Ech survival, our objective is to develop new compounds and techniques to further elucidate molecular mechanisms and treat obligatory intracellular bacterial infection. We showed that Ech has a unique type IV secretion system effector; Ehrlichial translocated factor-1 (Etf-1), which is abundantly produced and secreted in infected cells. Etf-1 is critical for Ech infection of human monocytes. We demonstrated that Etf-1 subverts and manipulates two important innate immune defense mechanisms against intracellular infection, cellular apoptosis and autophagy. Thus, Etf-1 is a potential target for anti-Ech therapy. Major barriers to Ech therapy and research progress are that 1) the important disease-associated Ech molecules are intracellular, protected from direct antibody or drug attack, and 2) protein-protein interactions (PPIs) such as those induced by Etf-1 are examples of ?undruggable? targets because small molecule inhibitors generally do not bind to the PPI interfaces with high affinity or specificity. However, cyclic peptides (cyclic Ps) are very effective inhibitors of PPIs and because cyclic Ps are proteolytically stable, non-immunogenic, and biologically active in cellular assays, they have great potential as Ech therapeutic agents and research tools. In collaboration with cyclic P expert co-I, we propose an innovative approach: to develop a cell-permeable bicyclic peptides (bicyclic Ps) as synthetic Ech inhibitors. We will synthesize a combinatorial library of ~10 million bicyclic Ps by fusing the first ring featuring a degenerate sequence and the second ring of a novel invariant cyclic cell-penetrating peptide. Our hypothesis is that bicyclic Ps are effective molecular tools and therapeutic agents to block Etf-1 functions and Ech infection. To test our hypothesis, in Aim 1, we will generate high-throughput screen random libraries of cell-permeable bicyclic Ps for Etf-1 binding and inhibition of Ech infection by: 1) synthesizing large one-bead-one-compound random libraries of bicyclic Ps and screening the libraries for binding to Etf-1; 2) sequencing, and chemically resynthesizing high affinity Etf-1-binding bicyclic Ps in sufficient quantity to screen for neutralization of Ech infection in host cells. In Aim 2, we will investigate the mechanism by which bicyclic Ps inhibit Etf-1 and Ech infection by examining: 1) bicyclic P blockade of Etf-1 translocation to mitochondria and inhibition of cellular apoptosis by Etf-1, 2) bicyclic P inhibition of Etf-1-induced cellular autophagy, Etf-1 activation of class III PtdIns3K, and formation of the Etf-1-BECN1-VPS34-RAB5 complex; and 3) efficacy of inhibition of Ech infection by selected combinations of bicyclic Ps. Our results will demonstrate the innovative use of a technology for intracellular delivery of compounds that interfere with targeted PPIs. This approach will overcome current barriers and advance research on obligatory intracellular bacterial infection."
"9599761","Abstract Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium that causes acute and chronic Q fever in humans. There is an urgent need to create a safe and effective vaccine for prevention of human Q fever. However, the mechanisms of vaccine-induced immunity against C. burnetii natural infection remain unclear. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a safe and effective vaccine against Q fever. The objective of this application, which is a critical step towards this goal, is to understand the role of dendritic cells (DCs) in regulating vaccine-induced immunity against Q fever and identify which type of T cell response is more critical for vaccine-induced protective immunity. To achieve this objective, two specific aims were proposed to test the central hypothesis that C. burnetii phase I vaccine (PIV) and phase II vaccine (PIIV) differentially activate DCs, thereby promoting distinct T cell responses are responsible for the difference in their ability to confer protection. Aim 1 will determine the role of DCs in regulating vaccine-induced immunity against Q fever by examining i) if PIV and PIIV differentially activate DCs, thereby promoting distinct T cell differentiation patterns in a mouse model; and ii) if DCs play a role in vaccine-induced protection against C. burnetii aerosol infection in vivo. Aim 2 will determine the role of CD4+ T cell subsets in PIV-induced protective immunity against C. burnetii aerosol infection by using a mouse model to investigate i) if PIV- and PIIV-induced T cell responses are responsible for the difference in their ability to confer protection; and ii) which CD4+ subset T cell response is more critical for PIV-induced protection. As an outcome of this research, it will gain novel information for understanding the role of DCs in regulating T cell-mediated immunity and determining the role of T cell responses in vaccine-induced protective immunity against C. burnetii infection. This is expected to have significant positive effects on publich health, because it will provide critical information for developing a safe and effective vaccine against Q fever."
"9621283","ABSTRACT Vaccination represents the single most effective and cost effective medical intervention devised to date, saving lives and reducing morbidity and disability for billions of humans. Despite the early success of the oral polio vaccine, most vaccines are delivered parenterally, and as such are associated with pain, non-compliance, biohazardous medical waste and strict requirements for expensive production, transport and storage logistics (the ?cold chain?) and for trained technical personnel. Oral/mucosal vaccine strategies eliminate or significantly reduce these drawbacks. The potential use of Arthrospira platensis (commonly called Spirulina) as an oral vaccine delivery platform is highly attractive, given its safety profile, rich nutritional content and wide acceptance as a human food source. At Lumen Bioscience, we utilize a proprietary and patent-pending technique to genetically engineer Spirulina to express heterologous proteins. Lumen Bioscience's Spirulina platform consists of recombinant strains designed to express viral capsid proteins that assemble and form durable high-order complexes commonly called virus-like particles (VLPs). Parenterally-administered VLPs have been used in humans for prevention of infections with human papilloma and hepatitis B viruses and malaria parasites. Orally-administered Spirulina-expressed VLPs have been engineered to efficiently express pathogen-derived antigens inserted into the exterior-facing VLP domains. Here, VLPs bearing epitopes derived from Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and other antigens were expressed in Spirulina and P. yoelii CSP-VLP-expressing Spirulina were administered orally to mice. This vaccine induced high titer systemic anti-CSP IgG, which conferred in vitro and in vivo protection against sporozoite invasion. This project aims to optimize and develop the oral Spirulina vaccine model as a safe oral pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine."
"9463453","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this proposal is to better understand the physiological and molecular mechanisms at work in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery mediated rapid reversal of the hyperglycemia associated with insulin resistance, prediabetes and T2DM. We propose a novel series of studies focused on the study of a recently recognized inhibitory circuit of glucose stimulated insulin secretion driven by dopamine (DA) stored in ß cell vesicles and the gut. We provide evidence that dopamine (DA) and Glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) represent two opposing arms of a glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) regulatory system and hypothesize that DA represents the anti incretin hypothesized to explain the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery on T2DM. We propose to study these putative circuits using minimally invasive molecular imaging techniques in an animal model. Concurrently, we will characterize dopamine metabolism in the gut and pancreas under fasting and meal stimulated conditions, including a limited human clinical study of dopamine metabolism in a population of patients who have undergone RYGB surgery. The new information obtained from this hypothesis driven research may directly impact our understanding of: 1) the mechanisms underlying improved glucose homeostasis seen before weight loss following bariatric surgery, and 2) the regulation of glucose stimulated insulin secretion within islets. On a practical level, our studies may result in the development of novels methods to quantitatively asses in real time by imaging both beta cell function as well as mass. Such methods may have clinical application in the treatment and management of diabetes and/or for vetting new drugs aimed preserving or restoring beta cell function and mass in disease."
"9511880","Abstract- TMAO and Incident Subclinical CVD, Clinical CVD, and Mortality  Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is an intestinal microbiome-dependent metabolite of L-carnitine, a nutrient in red meat, chicken, and fish, and lecithin, a nutrient in eggs, milk, meats and fish. In in vitro and animal models, TMAO promotes atherosclerosis, independently of traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Thus, TMAO represents a novel molecule that may account for links between diet and CVD and provide a clinically relevant molecular target for novel interventions to reduce risk.  Yet, the effects of TMAO on CVD risk in humans are not well established, with mixed evidence from a limited number of prior studies. This research will provide critical evidence on how TMAO relates to initiation, extent, and onset of atherosclerosis and clinical CVD in two independent, large, well-established, prospective community-based US cohort studies: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). MESA allows prospective investigation of onset of subclinical atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcium, CAC); and CHS, of clinical CVD events. This will provide robust, complementary evidence on how TMAO may influence atherosclerotic risk. The large number of health behaviors, risk factors, and subclinical and clinical disease outcomes in these cohorts will also facilitate multivariable adjustment as well as analyses related to other subclinical CVD outcomes.  The inclusion of two separate, large, prospective community-based cohorts of well- phenotyped US adults, including both middle-aged and older adults of diverse races/ethnicities with existing standardized measures of sociodemographics, diet, lifestyle, CVD risk factors, coronary calcium, subclinical CVD, and incident CVD events, will provide the most complete picture of how TMAO relates to initiation, extent, and clinical onset of CVD, of the independence of these relationships from other sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, and of possible heterogeneity in these relationships. The results will have tremendous impact for understanding whether and how TMAO influences CVD, directly informing the need for and design of large intervention studies to reduce TMAO levels including novel lifestyle strategies and novel pharmacologic and molecular interventions targeting both TMAO and the microbiome in humans."
"9513935","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant Adolescent girls in South Africa remain disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic, despite the availability of several behavioural interventions to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV. Strategies to reduce HIV transmission in this key population would benefit greatly from a better understanding of the sexual networks that drive HIV transmission in adolescent girls. Furthermore, if HIV infection rates in adolescent girls can be reduced, this could break critical chains of transmission and decrease the spread of HIV in the general population. We hypothesise that complex sexual networks, including mixing between adolescents and community members, drive high HIV incidence in adolescent girls in rural South Africa. To test our hypothesis we will utilize an innovative approach to identify networks of HIV transmission that combine extensive epidemiologic sampling with phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 sequence data and traditional sexual networking methods. Phylogenetic analysis has recently emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to use viral diversity to examine the underlying dynamics of HIV-1 transmission in affected populations. However, these methods have often failed to find linkages in endemic settings; this is likely due to underrepresentation because of sparse sampling of transmission pairs in large populations of HIV infected individuals. One of the major innovations of this proposal is identifying HIV-1 clusters and viral linkages in adolescents and link these to community sequences by extensively sampling HIV infected individuals from a defined geographic area (part of the sub-district of Vulindlela in KwaZulu-Natal), using several epidemiologic approaches to achieve a 'saturating' rate of population coverage. This area is uniquely suited for this research as the study area is rural and geographically well defined; it is one of the highest HIV burden districts in South Afric and CAPRISA has collected detailed data on the structural, behavioural and biological determinants of risks of HIV infection in this community over the last decade. Building on our expertise in HIV surveillance in this area we will i) enhance the representativeness of the phylogenetic analyses by combining novel recruitment strategies including clinic- and school-based recruitment, and respondent-driven sampling for hard-to-reach populations; ii) use high- throughput sequencing, and bioinformatics to identify HIV-1 transmission networks through HIV-1 viral linkages; and iii) include behavioural and biological information and other risk factors. This approach will allow us to characterize HIV transmission clusters and viral linkages in this hyper endemic region, analyze the contribution of HIV clusters to the new infections occurring among adolescent girls, and use this data to improve HIV prevention efforts in this key population for HIV control."
"9558292","Project Summary Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating, progressive disease with no known cure and no treatment that convincingly alters the disease course or significantly improves mortality. The objective of this proposal is the development of nebulized delivery of the small molecule inhibitor of Wnt/?-catenin signaling, BC-2059, for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. Pre-clinical studies in rodents, dogs, and minipigs show that BC-2059 has favorable pharmacokinetics and safety data with intravenous administration, which provides support for short-term use. However, in a chronic disease, such as IPF, which requires prolonged treatment, intravenous administration is undesirable for patients. Nebulization of BC-2059 would achieve high local levels of the drug, while minimizing off-target side effects in other critical organs, which is key for the chronic treatment of patients with pulmonary fibrosis. In Specific Aim 1, a respiratory formulation of BC-2059 will be optimized to generate particle sizes ?3 ?m to allow for maximal distribution into the alveolar spaces. In Specific Aim 2, the efficacy and pharmacodynamics of nebulized administration of BC-2059 will be determined in vivo using two mouse models of chronic pulmonary fibrosis, using intratracheally administered asbestos and repetitive intratracheal administration of bleomycin, both of which create non-resolving fibrosis. Nebulized BC-2059 will be administered after the establishment of pulmonary fibrosis, in order to determine whether the drug improves the resolution of fibrosis, which would increase its translational potential and make a clinically meaningful impact for patients. The overall goal for this Phase 1 application is the generation of high quality pre-clinical data that will provide a highly compelling rationale for clinical trials for the treatment of IPF and potentially other fibrotic lung diseases."
"9544524","Abstract The larynx is a strategically important organ situated at the crossroads of the upper respiratory and digestive tracts, orchestrating swallowing, breathing, coughing and, in humans, voice. The hallmark of many clinically important laryngeal diseases affecting these critical functions is mucosal inflammation. In other parts of the body, the pathogenesis of mucosal inflammatory disease is intimately linked to local immune responses. The long-term goal of our research is to improve prevention and management of vocal fold disease by identifying and manipulating the manner in which epithelial cell-fibroblast interactions modulate healthy and aberrant mucosal healing following inflammation. In our previous funding period, as a necessary first step to towards achieving our long term goal, we developed a steady source of stable vocal fold epithelial cells to study epithelial cell-fibroblast interactions and established a novel physiologically relevant, three-dimensional biomimetic in vitro vocal fold model of human origin. For the proposed funding period, we will specifically focus on using a unique combination of in vitro and vivo model systems, including those developed in the previous funding period, to further our knowledge of host mediated immune defenses and inflammatory based tissue alterations in the vocal fold mucosa when exposed to defined bacteria species. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify mechanisms by which resident commensal or pathogen bacterial species are identified by vocal folds via specialized receptors and control tissue immune homeostasis while promoting immune responses in the context of steady state and tissue inflammation. In Specific Aim 1, we will define the role of commensal bacteria in tuning vocal fold immune cells using gnotobiotic methodologies. In Specific Aim 2, we will identify toll like family receptors (TLR) in vocal fold tissue and novel human vocal fold epithelial cells in steady state and inflammatory conditions. Lastly, in Specific Aim 3, using our physiologically relevant three- dimensional biomimetic model of normal and inflammatory vocal fold mucosa, we will determine relative contribution of resident commensal and pathogenic microbial communities on vocal fold mucosal integrity and function. Taken together, our multidisciplinary exploitation of microbiology, next gen sequencing, and immunology will converge to reform exponentially our understanding of mechanisms of innate immune- microbial interactions in vocal fold inflammatory diseases. 1"
"9461107","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is focused on vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein that is a prominent component of focal adhesions and adherens junctions. Vinculin exists in an autoinhibited conformation and upon activation, functions as a scaffold to regulate cellular events resulting in cell migration, cell survival and embryogenesis. Vinculin null cells display tumorigenic properties and mutation or loss of vinculin is associated with cardiac disease. Although vinculin binds actin and phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (PIP2), we do not understand the nature of these interactions or their precise role in regulating vinculin function. In particular, the interaction between vinculin and actin plays a pivotal role in linking transmembrane receptors to the cytoskeleton, which, in turn, is important for controlling cellular cell morphology, force transmission and motility. Vinculin binds to F-actin and undergoes a conformational change that induces formation of a cryptic dimer necessary for actin filament bundling, but the conformation change that occurs and dimer that is formed is unknown. It is also unclear how vinculin recognizes PIP2, inserts into membranes and is regulated by this interaction. We propose highly integrated computational and experimental approaches to generate and test models for these important interactions and assess their significance in vinculin function both in vitro and in cells. This will be accomplished by generating and characterizing vinculin variants with specific defects in actin binding, actin-induced vinculin dimer formation and PIP2 association in vitro, and then expressing the full length wild type protein and mutants in vinculin null cells. The role of these interactions in regulating the activation state of vinculin as well as vinculin's force response and transmission properties will be probed at both the sub-cellular and whole cell level."

These 47 Scholars have come from 29 different disciplines, have been diverse in terms of gender (46% women) and race/ethnicity (15% underrepresented minorities), and are nicely distributed across the spectrum of T1 through T4 research. An additional strength is the fact that our Scholars are recruited from the 3 major research universities in the state: Indiana University, Purdue University, and the University of Notre Dame. This expands the pool or Scholars, faculty mentors, and breadth of translational research. In this application, we propose a number of new and innovative training initiatives that build upon our foundational programs. We designed the four specific aims of the KL2 Career Development Core Program to maximize its impact on the training and career development of clinical and translational scientists at an institutional, regional, and national level. 1) Increase the flexibility and reach of our foundational programs for personalize research training and accelerate mentored-to-independent investigator (K to R) status. 2) Add training in areas where our CERT program has unique strengths as well as gaps. Key domains include implementation, community-engagement, regulatory affairs, and population health. 3) Develop research training in 3 new areas: team science, entrepreneurship, and experiential learning. 4) Test innovative training approaches through research and national collaborations. We employ the continuous innovation cycle of ?4Ds? in all of our CTSI activities: Design, Demonstrate, Duplicate, and Disseminate. We also plan innovative initiatives that can serve as model programs for dissemination more broadly. These include a) peer and community mentoring programs to complement our already robust faculty-mentoring program: b) an inter-CTSA KL2 Scholar exchange program; c) an I-Corps training course that serve regional CTSA programs; d) national coordination of an on-line CTSA-industry training program in drug development conducted in collaboration with Lilly, our founding industry partner. We are optimizing program evaluation utilizing NCATS common metrics augmented with novel metrics. We are enhancing recruitment and retention of underrepresent minority scientists, and offering a new course in translational research ethics."
"9456198","SUMMARY Muscle contraction and cell motility are mediated by the interaction of myosin motors with actin filaments. The free energy from ATP hydrolysis is used to produce conformational changes in the actomyosin that produce force and movement. These conformational changes are associated with actomyosin interaction that promote successive release of phosphate (Pi) and ADP. Despite a detailed knowledge of the kinetics of actomyosin ATP hydrolysis in which actin accelerates the dissociation of Pi and ADP from myosin, our understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) by which the free energy of ATP hydrolysis is coupled to the production of work and movement by myosin motors remains elusive. High resolution x-ray crystal structures of the myosin head alone are available in various biochemical states, but due to resistance of filamentous actin (F-actin) to crystallization the only tool to reveal molecular details of force generation by myosin motors remains cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Recent cryo-EM structures of nucleotide free (rigor) actomyosin and actomyosin-ADP provided a mechanistic model of ~20 percent of the crossbridge movement that occurs at the end of the myosin work cycle, but a high resolution structure of the actomyosin-ADP-Pi intermediate that precedes the remaining 80% of the powerstroke associated with Pi dissociation is still unavailable. Studies of the structure of the prepowerstoke actomyosin-ADP-Pi have been unsuccessful because myosin-ADP-Pi is weakly bound to actin (Kd ~30 uM) and the Pi rapidly dissociates (< 5 ms for myosinVa) to form actomyosin- ADP. Because 80% of the crossbridge movement is associated with the dissociation of phosphate from actomyosin-ADP-PI, a detailed structure of actomyosin-ADP-Pi is crucial for understanding what is arguably the most important step of the actomyosin ATP hydrolysis mechanism. The ultimate aim of this application is to utilize a unique and sophisticated apparatus for millisecond time resolved cryo-EM combined with a state of the art electron microscope equipped with direct detector and new image processing techniques to produce high resolution 3D reconstructions of the prepower stroke actomyosin-ADP-Pi complex. In addition to these technical advances we will use site directed mutagenesis to produce myosin-ADP-Pi complexes that have 10- fold increased affinity for actin and 10-fold reduced rates of Pi dissociation. A high resolution structure of the prepowerstroke actomyosin-ADP-Pi complex will enable us to better understand how myosin motors function in muscle and non-muscle cells and open new avenues for treatment of myosin involved diseases such as cardiomyopathies and cancer metastasis."
"9454695","Project summary/abstract  Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a foodborne pathogen most commonly transmitted to humans when fecal material from cattle comes into contact with food, and the food is subsequently uncooked or undercooked. After colonization of the gastrointestinal tract, the organism can elaborate a toxin called Shiga toxin (Stx), which is necessary for the severe symptoms observed in some patients such as haemolytic uremic syndrome. Previous genetic studies identified several features common to highly virulent E. coli O157:H7 strains. For example, such strains often carry the Stx2a allelic variant, and invariably have a type III secretion system called the LEE. Genome analysis has also supported the hypothesis that highly virulence strains fall within defined phylogenetic lineages. More recently, studies from our group and others began to mechanistically describe how members of the gut microbiota may increase Stx2a production. This proposal builds on our preliminary data that suggests there are at least three mechanisms by which non-pathogenic E. coli increase Stx2a production by E. coli O157:H7 during co- culture: 1) through infection of the non-pathogenic strain by the stx2a-converting bacteriophage, described previously by others; 2) through secretion of a small molecule that triggers Stx2a activation; 3) through an undefined mechanism that does not appear to involve the phage or secreted molecules. Here, we propose in Aim 1 complementary genetic and biochemical approaches to identify the molecule secreted by a human commensal isolate designated 0.1229. Our published work demonstrated that toxin amplification driven by mechanism #1 could be recapitulated in a germ-free mouse model, and we will similarly test the hypothesis here that co-infection of mice with 0.1229 and E. coli O157:H7 results in greater virulence. Preliminary data indicates the secreted molecule has the characteristics of a microcin ? it is small (<10 kDa), heat resistant, and susceptible to Proteinase K. It was previously reported that E. coli from phylogroup B2, which is the most common lineage of human fecal E. coli isolates in the United States and several other countries including Japan and Australia, encode microcins and bacteriocins more frequently than isolates from other phylogroups. Therefore in Aim 2, we will leverage Penn State?s E. coli Reference Center collection to test the hypothesis that phylogroup B2 isolates increase toxin production by E. coli O157:H7 more commonly than non-B2 isolates.  Together, these two aims are expected to identify a new mechanism by which commensal E. coli could potentiate E. coli O157:H7 disease, and continue the development of tools for the identification of gut bacteria that impact Stx2a production. These data could be used to understand differences in disease severity between individuals, how diet-induced changes in the microbiota affect disease outcome, and to develop probiotic therapies for reducing toxin production by E. coli O157:H7 during an infection. 1"
"9512121","Project Summary  The purpose of the proposed work is first-in-man testing of novel painless defibrillation (PaDe) therapy. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) remains the number one killer in western civilization. The underlying mechanism of SCA is usually ventricular fibrillation (VF), and survival depends on prompt defibrillation. Existing defibrillators rely on the delivery of a brief high voltage shock to the heart. While this is life-saving, the shock is extremely painful when delivered to a conscious patient, as typically happens when the therapy is provided by an ICD.  The pain caused by standard ICD shocks is due to the abrupt contraction of skeletal muscles of the chest and abdomen when the shock is applied to the heart. Our team has developed a novel means to accomplish painless defibrillation using a burst of high frequency alternating current to tetanize skeletal muscle so it does not further contract when a defibrillatory shock is then applied. We have already proven substantial reduction in skeletal muscle activation in animals defibrillated using this technology, and therefore believe that delivery of this novel therapy in humans will be a far less painful alternative to standard defibrillation shocks.  In the proposed work, a table-top PaDe system developed in our Phase II grant will undergo final verification and validation testing needed to obtain FDA approval of an IDE, which will then enable us to evaluate this therapy in patients coming for elective ICD replacement. Patients will receive one PaDe therapy and one standard shock in random order, and will report the pain perceived with each of these, blinded to which is which. We intend to show that PaDe therapy is safe and effective, and will then seek FDA approval of the therapy."
"9514782","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The pathophysiological brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease [AD] begin decades before clinical symptoms. Although recent advances have led to a preclinical biomarker model of AD pathogenesis (first amyloid-beta [Aß] pathology, second neurodegeneration, and lastly cognitive symptoms), the mechanisms that underlie these pathological changes remain unknown, impeding the identification of potential biomarkers and treatment targets. Previous studies of blood or CSF biomarkers have mostly employed clinical outcomes (i.e., cognitively normal [CN], mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and AD. However, clinical phenotypes are heterogeneous. Thus, categorizing individuals by their clinical phenotype alone will include a mixture of individuals with varying types and severities of brain pathologies (e.g., Aß pathology, neurodegeneration, vascular disease). The overarching goal of this project is to determine the temporal relationship between plasma and CSF sphingolipids (e.g., ceramides, sphingomyelins), in vivo measures of Aß pathology (Aß imaging, CSF Aß) and neurodegeneration (FDG-PET hypometabolism, hippocampal atrophy, CSF tau), and clinical endpoints. As inflammation is associated with AD, and is intimately interrelated with sphingolipids, we will also determine whether inflammatory processes (e.g., TNF-? and IL-6) modify the associations between sphingolipids and in vivo AD pathology. While previous studies have examined many plasma and CSF biomarkers with limited success, the study of sphingolipids is uniquely promising and highly innovative. First, cellular and animal studies demonstrate direct links between sphingolipids and measures of Aß pathology and neurodegeneration. Reducing Aß-associated increases in ceramide levels prevents neurodegeneration. Second, we consistently demonstrate that high levels of plasma sphingolipids predict cognitive decline among individuals who are CN, MCI, and AD. The next logical step is to determine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between the sphingolipids and in vivo evidence of AD pathology. For example, we will determine whether individuals with both abnormal Aß and elevated ceramides develop more neurodegeneration and cognitive decline compared to individuals with abnormal Aß and low ceramides. To accomplish our goals we will utilize a longitudinal collection of cognitive endpoints and in vivo measures of Aß pathology and neurodegeneration from individuals enrolled in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging [MCSA] and the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Together these longitudinal studies have accumulated over 2,375 visits with Aß imaging, FDG-PET, and MRI scans on 1,617 unique individuals, and more than 1,085 CSF samples from 870 unique individuals, providing an ideal resource to test our hypotheses. The proposed research will further our understanding of the interrelationship between plasma and CSF sphingolipids, the development and progression of AD pathology, and the emergence and progression of clinical symptoms. This work will contribute to the identification of new treatment strategies for delaying, or possibly preventing, AD."
"9475768","E. Abstract (Molecular Mechanisms Core) Nutrition and Obesity Research Centers (NORCS) serve as focal points for biomedical research targeting nutritionally responsive chronic diseases, arguably the greatest public health challenge of the 21st century. In this context, the PBRC NORC has chosen the theme of ?Nutrition, Obesity, and Metabolic Health through the Lifespan?, with emphasis on three research focus areas: (1) Maternal/Infant nutritional status; (2) Pediatric and adulthood obesity and (3) Nutritional status at older age to preserve physical and cognitive functionality. Nutrition and obesity are significant modulators of whole-body physiology, as they can impinge upon cellular signaling pathways in essentially every cell type and tissue of the body. Both short-term and chronic exposure, to e.g. to nutrients, or to metabolic state, can produce specific cellular or physiological responses. Understanding the mechanisms affected by nutrition, obesity, or both, and the resulting consequences for metabolic health, represents the critical foundation for the development of treatments to improve public health, and for the invention of new strategies for prevention of chronic disease. The Molecular Mechanisms Core provides scientific, technological, and bioinformatics assistance for investigating the molecular etiology elicited by nutrition, obesity, or both. The majority of Core technologies are centered on capturing changes in expression of genes and gene products, both crucial readouts of acute and chronic exposure effects. The Core offers functional genomics and systems biology tools for transcriptome profiling, methods for expression measurements on the tissue and cellular level, and powerful quantitative bioimaging technology to localize expression in cells or tissues with high resolution. Expression measurements are complemented by epigenomics tools to investigate the upstream regulatory mechanisms, and by procedures to monitor cellular bioenergetics, a crucial readout of cellular function that affects metabolic health. As a new development, the Core provides both molecular and imaging techniques towards the analysis of gut microbiome composition, an important modulator of metabolic health. The Molecular Mechanism Core provides service, method development, consultation, enrichment, and community outreach to a large user base, and consistently supports NIH-funded research projects. By offering shared technologies that are typically too complex and too expensive for research laboratories, and by serving as an intellectual resource, the Core removes critical barriers to progress in the field for many NORC members and investigators in Louisiana, and assists them with adapting new technology into their research programs."

"9488345","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed project, ?Identifying neurobiological predictors of alcohol use onset during adolescence?, responds to the need for a better understanding of the characteristics present prior to initiation of alcohol use that may represent risk factors for use onset during adolescence. Early initiation of alcohol use is considered one of the most important risk factors in the later development of alcohol and substance use disorders, but it is not yet well understood when initiation of use is driving neurobiological changes that account for this increased vulnerability, and when initiation is largely a proxy for pre-existing traits and neurobiological patterns, which may actually be responsible for the risk. The present prospective study therefore aims to identify those neurobiological and behavioral markers that exist prior to the initiation of alcohol use and may confer risk for earlier use onset. Specifically, the study will rely on analysis of functional connectivity data from a hippocampus-mediated spatial memory task and a frontally-mediated response inhibition task, in order to test the importance of hippocampus-PFC integration in informing adaptive decision-making and reducing risky behaviors. Adolescents are being enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcohol or other drug use at 13-14 years old for a baseline scanning visit, and are being followed for two years via annual visits and quarterly phone interviews to assess initiation of alcohol and substance use and other risky behaviors. Baseline scanning includes acquisition of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during response inhibition and spatial memory tasks, and resting state perfusion (PCASL). Magnetic resonance measures are being integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize patterns that may be predictive of initiation and other risky alcohol and drug use in adolescence. Together these data will provide a foundation for informing neurobehavioral targets and strategies for prevention and intervention efforts in maladaptive alcohol and substance use."
"9589159","Project Summary: Many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and the polyglutamine diseases, result from protein misfolding and accumulation due to a variety of genetic and/or environmental causes. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset, inherited neuromuscular disease that is caused by polyglutamine expansion within the androgen receptor (AR); it is related to other neurodegenerative diseases caused by polyglutamine expansion, including Huntington's disease and several spinocerebellar ataxias. Although the precise pathway leading to neuronal dysfunction and death is unknown, the evaluation of transgenic mouse and cell models of these diseases has yielded mechanistic insights to disease pathogenesis. SBMA stands apart from other polyglutamine diseases in that its onset and progression are dependent on AR androgenic ligands. Our cell and mouse models of SBMA reproduce the androgen- and polyglutamine-dependent nuclear AR aggregation seen in patients, as well as its consequent toxicity, making these models highly useful for the analysis of the mechanistic basis for upstream events involved in AR toxicity. Our long-term objectives are to use these models to develop a mechanistic understanding of steps in SBMA pathogenesis that occur in response to hormone binding and to develop therapeutic approaches based on that understanding. Our previous studies revealed that a specific conformational state of the AR that occurs upon hormone binding, the N/C interaction, is required for its aggregation and toxicity; inhibition of the N/C interaction is protective in both in vitro and in vivo models. Moreover, we found that Ser-16 phosphorylation is required for this protection. We propose in this application to further understand the mechanism underlying the role of both the AR N/C interaction and Ser-16 phosphorylation in disease. In addition, we propose to screen selective AR modulators (SARMs) that prevent the AR N/C interaction for their effects on SBMA pathogenesis, both in vitro and in vivo. We anticipate that results from these studies will lead us to a new understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of SBMA and enhance our development of new therapies for SBMA."
"9231410","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will conduct Phase I clinical trials of new anticancer agents or combinations of anticancer agents to characterize drug toxicity, determine the maximum tolerated dose, evaluate the pharmacokinetics, perform pharmacogenetic analysis, and relating clinical endpoints to pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics, and/or biologic endpoints. A major focus of this proposal is the study agents that interact with novel targets such as signal transduction pathways, cell cycle checkpoint components, DNA repair pathways and apoptosis regulators, either alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy. The endpoints for the evaluation of such treatments will be clinical effect (toxicity and antineoplasti response) as well as alterations in biochemical pathways affected in preclinical model systems. The specific aims of these studies are: to determine as efficiently as compatible with patient safety the appropriate dose of new anticancer agents selected by the National Cancer Institute using novel trial designs including accelerated titration, Bayesian design, and other advanced design schemes; to identify clinical, pharmacokinetic, or other laboratory parameters that may predict toxicity; to determine whether functional polymorphisms of drug metabolizing or other enzymes associated with drug response alter pharmacokinetics, toxicity and/or activity of agents being studied; to obtain mechanistic proof-of-principle data for new agents directed at novel molecular cancer targets when appropriate; to evaluate translational endpoints in clinical trials o investigational agents such as, levels of expression and/or activity of molecular targets and/or downstream effectors pertinent to a given agent or pathway modulated by the agent under study; to identify potential biomarkers (with particular emphasis where possible on genomics and imaging) that may serve as predictors of outcome in later phase trials; to translate novel discoveries from R0l, SPORE, or other peer reviewed mechanisms into clinical trials that leverage the scientific community expertise with a team science approach. Studies will be designed to incorporate the appropriate pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic analysis, drug analysis, and biological analysis of drug effects on the intended target or pathway.         RELEVANCE: The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center and University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center provides an exceptional environment to perform early phase trials in a diverse population. The team environment and expertise of the 2 centers that will be brought to focus on phase 1 trials will facilitate translation of novel preclinical discoveries into treatments that ca be assessed for efficacy in Phase II and Phase III trials."
"9597699","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We aim to study how neural activity at the level of single unit responses in the hippocampus mediates the known roles of synaptic plasticity and hippocampal neural circuitry in learning and memory. In particular, we are interested in the synaptic plasticity and circuit mechanisms responsible for the activation of hippocampal units in the rat in precise sequences that depict past and future behavioral trajectories. (1) Pioneering work has established that place field responses can reflect multiple aspects of memory and exhibit a complex dependence upon mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, and yet experience-dependent changes to place fields tend to be rather subtle and challenging to detect. In contrast, trajectory-specific place-cell sequences can be detected after very little experience. We will examine the dependence of this possible learning effect on mechanisms associated with synaptic plasticity, with particular attention to the interesting counter-hypothesis that the sequences may exist prior to experience. Preliminary data show that synaptic plasticity is required during experience in order to encode replay memory, whereas the generation of replay per se does not require synaptic plasticity if the underlying memories have already been formed. We will pursue these experiments to understand how multiple mechanisms of synaptic plasticity shape place-cell sequences. (2) A central role for CA3 in the generation of replay is a longstanding but untested prediction. Previous studies using genetic silencing of CA3 input found preserved ripple patterns in CA1, but these studies may have allowed compensatory effects due to the long time course of suppression. We will pursue an optogenetic approach for instantaneous suppression. Preliminary data show that ripples and ripple-associated spiking are in fact dependent upon CA3 input to the locally recorded CA1 region. We will also online decode replay sequences in real-time, to selectively disrupt sequences and also sequence subcomponents. We will dissect the contribution of CA3 to replay initiation, direction, propagation and termination. (3) During the theta exploratory state, CA1 units are driven by two major inputs: CA3 and entorhinal cortex (EC), which recent reports show may interact in complex ways, both within and across different theta cycles. These hypothesized interactions have not been tested directly, and so we will utilize our optogenetic approach to examine CA1 unit activity during this state. Preliminary data show that in contrast to ripples, CA1 spiking is only partially reduced when CA3 input is suppressed during theta, unmasking the EC contribution. We will examine place fields, phase precession, theta sequences, and the synchronization of CA1 low/high gamma with CA3/EC, either with or without CA3 input. Taken together, these specific aims represent a unique approach that utilizes the power of ultra-high density unit recording together with pharmacological and optogenetic manipulation, to deliver insights into the neural basis of learning and memory. Our results will have a major impact on understanding those diseases that impair hippocampal learning and memory such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, stroke and normal aging."
"9474654","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) the proposed research will evaluate the efficacy of two culturally-tailored technology- mediated disease prevention interventions for supporting change in multiple risk behaviors in rural Alaska Native (AN) men and women. Directly informed by the research team's fieldwork over the past 6 years in rural Alaska, continued community partnership with the tribes, and ethnographic research, the interventions will be tailored to AN health needs and values to target 5 of the American Heart Association's 7 Strategic Impact Goals for 2020.  In a randomized controlled 2-group design, the trial will compare two active treatment conditions: Group 1 targets tobacco and physical activity; Group 2 targets control of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia (HTN-HCL) through medication adherence and nutritional changes. Both conditions utilize trans theoretical model-tailored, computerized interventions, delivered via telemedicine by Indigenous-focused counselors located in Anchorage reaching AN people in their rural home villages. Computerized intervention contacts occur at baseline, 3-, 6- and 12-months with final assessment at 18-months. Study design provides an equivalent contact time and technology comparison; facilitates individual-level randomization within communities, as all participants receive highly individualized counseling and intervention materials; and allows for comparison of traditional risk factor (HTN-HCL) versus risk behavior (tobacco/ physical activity) interventions. Participants (N=300) will be daily smokers with at least one additional cardiovascular disease risk factor (e.g., inactivity, overweight, HTN, HCL) or established vascular disease. The trial aims to reach AN people regardless of residential location or intention to change.  The primary hypothesis is that Group 1 will achieve significantly greater biochemically- confirmed tobacco abstinence than Group 2 through 18-months follow-up and secondarily will significantly increase their physical activity. Secondary hypotheses are that Group 2 will achieve significantly greater control of HTN and HCL than Group 1 through (i) medication compliance and (ii) dietary change. Tertiary aims will: (a) compare the interventions on overall behavior change; (b) model cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of each intervention; and (c) examine moderators/mediators of treatment outcome, including the trans-3'-hydroxycotinine to cotinine ratio, a noninvasive measure of nicotine metabolism rate. The proposal combines technology, pharmacology, behavioral science, and health economics for advancing the health of AN people who face significant health disparities with limited access to interventions given their isolated geographics."
"9477548","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This submission from the Childrens Hospital of UPMC and the University of Pittsburgh responds to the TriaNet RFA DK-13-010. This group of investigators, with extensive experience who are a current TrialNet center, has the resources, and ability to add to our current large number of affiliates and a track record demonstrating our ability to continue TrialNet participation as a center. In order to answer the objective of the RFA we have described in detail our record of recruitment into clinical trials of new onset patients an relatives at risk, with our success being based on our very large patient population and longevity of our research team. Increased support from the new Clinical Network Hub will support us in expansion of our efforts and especially our work with affiliates to increase their involvement and recruitment efforts. We are also able to include our fellow trainees in the TrialNet Investigations to train the T1D clinical trialists of the future. Our investigators and nurses have been very involved with all national TrialNet activities and committees and plan to continue or increase this involvement. In addition our center has proposed a randomized double blinded trial to evaluate the efficacy of a new FDA approved diabetes-suppressive cell vaccine, consisting of autologous monocyte- derived dendritic cells treated ex vivo with antisense phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides targeting the primary transcripts of the CD40, CD80 and CD86 co-stimulatory molecules (immunoregulatory)(iDC). The initial trial in patients with new onset Type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been approved in principal by the TrialNet steering committee pending funding. As in all the TrialNet interventions, the hypotheses to be tested in this study are that gene-engineered autologous iDC can attenuate or suppress the autoimmunity in: a) newly- diagnosed T1D, sparing residual beta cell mass, with restoration of insulin secretion as assessed by stimulated C- peptide levels. b) relatives with disease predicting islet autoantibodies, to sustain insulin secretion and to prevent or delay progression to clinical T1D. Currently, other than immune suppression with considerable potential side effects, there is no other means to reverse or prevent new-onset T1D. Our goal is to develop safe, easily administered interventions to suppress the autoimmune disease process. The strength of this proposal is the expertise and experience of the investigators, well established collaborations across centers and a novel intervention strategy."
"9526983","Project Summary/Abstract  Mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction are early pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is a mitochondrial ion channel that plays a central role in cell death during age- related neurodegeneration, therefore mPTP can serve as an important therapeutic target. Studies show that the major mPTP inducer, the peptidylprolyl isomerase cyclophilin D (CypD), interacts directly with the OSCP subunit of the stator arm of the mammalian ATP synthase. The stator arm stabilizes the connection between the ATP synthase catalytic (F1) and membrane (FO) portions. In AD, a complex of CypD and oligomeric A? peptide have been found to potentiate mPTP opening, resulting in impaired mitochondrial function, neuronal injury and death.  We have recently suggested a novel role of the ATP synthase membrane embedded c- subunit in forming the pore of mPT. We have found further that the F1 portion of the ATP synthase gates the channel and that the loss of F1 components and OSCP during glutamate- induced excitotoxicity is correlated with neuronal death. We suggest that disruptions in interaction between the F1 and the stator arm during neuronal toxicity destabilize the ATP synthase structure, making the mitochondria more susceptible to mPT and cell death.  In this proposal, using mutagenesis, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms that lead to the opening of the c-subunit leak channel, which converts the ATP synthase from an energy-conserving to an energy-dissipating, cell death-inducing, device. In order to attempt to enhance neuronal survival in the face of stress, we will perform mutations within the ATP synthase that modify the conformation of the ATP synthase, preventing mPT channel gating and decreasing channel conductance. Based on our mutagenesis findings we will design a transgenic mouse on the background of the AD model (Tg mAPP) mouse to study if neuroprotective ATP synthase mutations will protect the Tg mAPP mouse from the onset of AD- like features. We will also introduce the same mutations in non transgenic mouse to study the physiological roles of mPTP in the cell in general.  Identifying molecular mechanisms underlying c-subunit gating will provide us with increased understanding of the role of mPTP in aging and neurodegeneration. The findings will lead to the design of specific and potent therapeutic compounds to target the mPTP directly, resulting in preventative strategies for neurodegenerative disease."
"9599358","ABSTRACT Asthma has become the most common chronic respiratory disease in this country. A characteristic of this disease is airway mucus hyperproduction and hypersecretion. The inflammatory milieu in asthma induces airway epithelium secretory cells (AESCs) to increase production of mucins (the glycoprotein core of mucus) at a rate that overwhelms the beneficial basal secretion of mucins, so mucins accumulate in AESC secretory granules. Secretagogues such as ATP, acetylcholine and histamine can stimulate the sudden release of large amounts of accumulated mucins into airways that contain a limited amount of liquid. The accumulation of poorly hydrated and excessively viscoelastic mucus occludes the airways, and airway mucus plugging has been linked to lethal exacerbations of asthma. Another hallmark of asthma is airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), which was thought to reflect increased contractility of airway smooth muscle around a thickened airway wall, producing airway obstruction. The importance of mucus plugging as another fundamental mechanical factor in AHR was proven in recent experiments in which airway mucus occlusion was required for AHR in a mouse model of asthma. Inflammation is a key feature of asthma. Among inflammatory cells, mast cells (MCs) infiltrate the airway wall, including the mucosa. They accumulate in their secretory granules many substances that are known AESC secretagogues, and they release them upon exposure to an allergen and other stimuli. What is not known is if MC degranulation triggers pathologic AESC secretion and airway mucus occlusion in vivo. Altering mucus viscoelasticity and decreasing mucin production are targets being explored in asthma. We postulate that interfering with mucin secretion is also a viable alternative. We have shown that Synaptotagmin-2 (Syt2) is required for MC degranulation and AESC stimulated secretion. We will explore as part of Aim 1 if lacking Syt2 can also increase the beneficial baseline mucin secretion from AESC since Syt2 deletion increases baseline synaptic vesicle release from neurons. In Aim 2, we propose to study a tissue- specific conditional Syt2 KO mouse in an inhalation-only model of allergic asthma, using in addition to cholinergic stimuli a direct allergen challenge to better simulate clinical situations. We plan to test if blocking MC degranulation as a trigger, or decreasing AESC stimulated mucin secretion as an effector, or increasing AESC baseline mucin secretion to deplete intracellular mucin stores, or all of the above, can prevent airway mucus occlusion and AHR. Our experiments will pave a way to explore the roles of MC and AESC exocytosis in other manifestations of asthma, will validate mucin secretion as a potential step to be manipulated in the management of this disease, and will pinpoint Syt2 as a viable therapeutic target."
"9576657","Project Summary/Abstract Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)-targeted therapy (MTT) currently is approved for treating metastatic melanoma patients with tumors harboring an oncogenic mutation in BRAF. Anti-PD-1 antibodies are the standard front-line approach for patients with metastatic melanoma, regardless of genotype, but responses only are seen in 40-45% of patients. To improve outcomes with MTT and anti-PD1, more effective approaches are needed. We recently demonstrated that MTT leads to increased tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) number, clonality, and effector function, as well as increased immune exhaustion markers such as PD-1, its ligand PD- L1, and TIM3. We hypothesize that these MTT-associated tumor microenvironment changes enhance immune responses in the tumor microenvironment and have the potential to convert an immunologically non-responsive tumor microenvironment into one more responsive to subsequent anti-PD1 therapy. To test our hypothesis, we have opened a trial (NCT031429029) that incorporates a lead-in phase of MTT, a brief period of concomitant MTT and anti-PD-1 therapy with pembrolizumab (pembro), followed by single-agent pembro (Aim 1). We will investigate the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of abbreviated MTT in combination with pembro and determine if MTT-associated effects on the tumor-immune microenvironment are associated with improved CBR at 24 weeks. As part of the trial, serial biopsies (pretreatment, post-MTT lead-in, and on-MTT plus pembro) and peripheral blood will be collected, and our team of clinical, translational, and basic investigators will use these samples to identify biomarkers associated with response and to develop a mechanistic understanding of the effects of MTT alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody therapy on the tumor microenvironment. We also will evaluate the effects of anti-PD-1 and MTT on T cell responses in a GEMM melanoma model and in patients (Aim 2). We will analyze T cell subsets in the mouse melanoma model, assessing the generation of memory T cells in mice that control tumors using tumor rechallenge studies. We will characterize T cell responses in the patients enrolled in the clinical trial in Aim 1, focusing on features of effector, memory, and exhausted T cell subsets. Lastly, we will examine memory populations in melanoma patients who are long- term survivors after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors or MTT. Finally, we will pair these translational studies with a complementary mouse melanoma model to determine how this therapy affects the generation, function and maintenance of T cell subsets, and identify new potential therapeutic strategies using in vivo CRISPR screens of mouse melanoma cells.

"9693468","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although smoking cessation efforts by NIDA and others have been successful, millions of Americans continue to smoke. Additionally, our laboratories have found important results on the metabolic effects of nicotine, including findings that nicotine plus a high fat diet (HFD) leads to hepatic and muscle steatosis. We have also used a large database to show that secondhand smoke is associated with both diabetes and obesity. This has led us to develop the theme of the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (CDU) Diversity-Promoting Institution Drug Abuse Research Program (DIDARP) to be Metabolic Effects of  Nicotine: it Matters. Our training theme will continue to be Research Teams of the Future that is based on the NIH roadmap. Our training program will focus on minority trainees at all levels and make a difference in the long run by tackling the problem of substance abuse. The overarching goal of the research, training and education programs of this DIDARP are to enhance CDU's capacity to conduct substance abuse research with a primary focus on the metabolic effects of nicotine. The specific goals of CDU DIDARP are:   1. To increase the number of high quality drug addiction research projects related to the metabolic effects of nicotine to allow CDU to develop expertise and acquire preliminary data to be able to compete for NIDA P01, P50 or ROI grants;   2. To continue to foster interest in substance abuse research among under-represented students and other trainees by providing meaningful educational and research experiences; and   3. To continue to enhance the research infrastructure at CDU to support substance abuse research.  To achieve these goals, we will have 3 related, cross-disciplinary projects:  Project 1: Nicotine exacerbates high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and skeletal muscle abnormalities in obese mice.  Pilot Project A: Understanding the role of dopamine in binge-eating, nicotine and alcohol use: a translational PET study.  Pilot Project B: The association between secondhand smoking and diabetes, obesity and other chronic diseases.  Achieving these goals will eventually help reduce the health disparities as related to substance abuse."

"9541023","SUMMARY The demonstration that extracellular vesicles (EVs), carrying RNA, DNA, proteins and lipids, play important roles in maintaining human health as well as contribute to driving disease has opened up a whole new field of research. Therefore, EVs have tremendous biologic significance and clinical potential, making a meeting focused on this area of research both highly timely and quite significant. The proposed Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Conference Seminar (GRS) entitled ?Extracellular Vesicles: Biologic Effects and Therapeutic Potential?, to be held at the Sunday River Resort in Newry, Maine, August 19-24, 2018, will bring together a very diverse array of senior and early career investigators in both basic and clinical fields. There will be an emphasis on promoting interactions between participants to facilitate the development of collaborative and translational research. GRCs are one of only a few types of meetings that facilitate these important interactions between senior and junior investigators. This GRC will be led off with keynote presentations by Peter Quesenberry and Alissa Weaver on the physio-pathological role of EVs followed by sessions covering: 1) Biogenesis, composition and characterization of EVs; 2) EVs as delivery vehicles; 3) EVs in Inflammation; 4) EVs and infectious diseases; 5) EVs in cancer; 6) EVs and clinical applications; 7) EVs in neurobiology; and 8) EVs and stem cells. General issues to be focused on will be EV heterogeneity, isolation and quantification strategies, trafficking of EVs, EVs as biomarkers and therapeutic efficacy of EVs. The objective of the second GRC and first GRS on extracellular vesicles is to encompass this rapidly growing research field of extracellular vesicles and RNA, bringing together a range of basic and clinical investigators focusing on issues of biologic actions of vesicles and clinical potential of vesicles both as biomarkers and therapeutics. Overall, the GRC and GRS on EVs promise to be very diverse and exciting conferences, which should lead to important collaborations that move the field forward both as to basic studies and clinical applications."
"9511223","Project Summary  To continue to march towards developing an effective cure for ALS, it is imperative to: 1) ascertain the contribution of neurons, other than motor neurons, to the disease: 2) identify the molecular mechanisms that trigger or fail to stop pathophysiological changes in neurons, including motor neurons; and 3) develop culture assays that faithfully and reliably recapitulate pathogenic cellular and molecular changes that occur in vivo. In published findings, we and others have shown that sensory axons and nerve endings in the periphery degenerate early and progressively in SOD1G93A and TDP43A315T mice. These cellular features are also found in motor neurons afflicted with ALS, suggesting that the same molecular mechanisms critical for maintaining and repairing axons and their nerve endings may become dysfunctional in both types of neurons. However, the soma of sensory neurons does not atrophy in mice harboring ALS-causing mutant genes despite the degeneration of their nerve endings, indicating that there are differences in how these two neuronal populations respond to ALS-induced pathogenesis. These similarities and differences between sensory and motor neurons affected with ALS present unique opportunities to uncover shared mechanisms involved in axonal degeneration and activated to maintain the viability of the neuronal soma. In this proposal, we will examine the impact of two ALS-causing mutant genes on sensory neurons in vivo and in culture. In aim 1, we will determine cellular changes altered in sensory neurons expressing ALS-causing mutant genes maintained in culture for weeks. In aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that sensory neurons harboring ALS-causing mutant genes are sensitive to cellular stressors, an experiment designed to recapitulate stressors these and other neurons encounter in vivo. In aim 3, we will determine molecular features shared between sensory neurons expressing different ALS-causing mutant genes. Altogether, this proposal will further our understanding of pathological changes that occur in sensory neurons harboring ALS-causing mutant genes, establish primary sensory neurons as a cellular assay in culture to identify and test therapeutics for ALS and uncover molecular mechanisms altered by expression of both, SOD1G93A and TDP43A315T."
"9281581","Abstract  The administrative core (ADM) will function in an overall supervisory capacity for our Phase III COBRE. It is comprised of a steering committee, external and internal advisory committees, and other stakeholders. The ADM core will be directed by Dr. Vince Calhoun, the PI for the current proposal. It will also operate under the supervi- sion of a well-respected psychiatric clinician-researcher, Dr. Juan Bustillo, and Dr. Nora Perrone-Bizzozero, an established neuroscientist and educator. Drs. Jeff Lieberman, MD and Charles Bowden, MD will serve as exter- nal consultants. The core director will coordinate the duties and goals of the ADM core, focused on three aims: 1) to coordinate all the specific budgetary, regulatory, and personnel aspects required in the three technical cores and Pilot Project Program; 2) set up a strong community outreach program and support new investigator projects using our pilot project core; and 3) maintain and continue to develop vital core facilities in consultation with internal and external advisors. A long-term aim of this Phase III award is to expand the capability of our facilities and further develop a diversified neuroimaging research environment that will continue to be competitive nation- ally and internationally. We believe that through the support of a COBRE Phase III, our cohesive and collabora- tive program of interdisciplinary and translational research can be leveraged into a center-level grant (e.g. P41, P50) which will be submitted approximately 3 years after the start of the Phase III award. Hence, this Phase III award is essential for the overall success of our New Mexico program on multimodal imaging of neuropsychiatric illness. 2"
"9522805","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers' Care Management Program: Link2Care, is considered one of the most promising ways to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient health at the same time. The program targets super-utilizers of the health care system - specifically adults with two or more hospitalizations in the prior six months and multiple chronic conditions - with intensive care-management services in the months following hospital discharge. A team of nurses, social workers, community health workers and health coaches, supported by real-time data of healthcare use, perform home visits, accompany patients to doctor visits, and help patients enroll in social-service programs. This approach aims to improve the self-sufficiency of patients in navigating the healthcare and social-service systems and has the potential to reduce hospital use and improve patient well-being. This project will rigorously investigate the impacts of the program on subsequent healthcare utilization and the use of social services through a randomized controlled trial."
"9585109","Project Summary  Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) regulate protein functions and play ubiquitous roles in a wide and diverse range of cellular processes in eukaryotes. Not surprisingly pathogens have evolved to target eukaryotic PTMs for promoting bacterial infection. Ubiquitination is a PTM that regulates multiple cellular processes including immunity, vesicle trafficking, and cell cycle control. Chlamydia trachomatis targets PTMs by secreting the virulence factor ChlaDUB1, which functions as a deubiquitinating and deneddylating enzyme. Preliminary studies indicate that ChlaDUB1 acts early in infection to attenuate activation of the NF-kB pathway while in mid stages of infection ChlaDUB1 targets host PTMs for co-opting cellular organelles. We hypothesize that C. trachomatis uses ChlaDUB1 to counteract host immune defenses and to exploit host resources. To test this hypothesis, genetically engineered C. trachomatis strains will be generated to dissect the PTM activities of ChlaDUB1 and to define their roles in manipulating NF-kB signaling and host organelles. The impact of these activities on C. trachomatis replication and the immune responses elicited will be assessed in in-vivo models of infection. Secondly, through a series of biochemical analyses and proteomic approaches designed to quantitatively measure global changes to host PTMs, substrates targeted by ChlaDUB1 during dampening of NF-kB activation and co-option of organelles will be identified."
"9547215","Culture change (CC) in long-term care (LTC) represents a set of increasingly adopted models that have had only limited research on their successes and challenges. CC was developed as an alternative to the institutional and hierarchical model characteristic of many LTC settings, which research has shown to be associated with a loss of older adults? autonomy, dignity, privacy, and choice; consistently low quality of care; poor resident health outcomes; and staff dissatisfaction. CC is broadly described as a transformational process leading to a better quality of life, but its exact definition varies widely. Currently, there is a nationwide movement to implement CC models in assisted living (AL) as well as nursing homes because the AL sector has become increasingly institutionalized despite its origin as a social model of care.  For this proposed research, our work will examine how CC is locally defined in one AL setting which has been undergoing CC for several years. We will investigate how local definitions of CC incorporate critical components that include resident and staff empowerment; collaborative decision-making; person-centered care; and flexibility in a care environment that has been ?transformed? to benefit the health and wellness of both residents and employees. A key criterion of CC is the production of a resident-directed and staff- supported program of daily living that addresses the residents? personal, social, and medical needs and desires. Our previous study of this site provides a longitudinal context to the proposed research to see how CC has fared over time, to explore its effect on the quality of life and health for residents and staff, and to examine the impact of increasingly more residents moving in to AL with Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias.  While CC has often been presented as a unified or seamless movement toward a shared goal of LTC reform, our prior research indicates that LTC settings vary greatly in their approach to the achievement of CC. To date, there have been few studies of CC in LTC settings that assess its implementation, challenges, barriers, benefits, and meanings, especially over time and especially concerning Alzheimer?s disease itself. In addition, CC research has yet to fully capture the perspectives of frontline workers (direct care, housekeeping, maintenance, and dietary) in these environments. These are critical gaps in research because residents in LTC have most day-to-day contact with frontline workers since they provide 80 ? 90% of care. This proposed research would focus on how CC is defined, experienced, and sustained by residents, family, frontline staff, and managers in one AL; compare data collected on one AL across three NIA-supported grants to understand how CC was introduced, monitored, and reinterpreted locally over time; and examine how the CC philosophy adapts to the increasing numbers of AL residents living with Alzheimer?s disease and related disorders.  Participant observation and in-depth ethnographic interviewing will be conducted at one Maryland AL that is undergoing intentional CC. Standard methods of qualitative data analysis will be utilized."
"9677541","Project Summary The overall goal of our research is to identify the mechanisms and factors/metabolite(s) by which dietary soluble fiber inulin induces hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in mice lacking toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5). TLR5, an innate immune receptor that senses bacterial flagellin, plays a critical role in gut microbiota homeostasis. Accordingly, TLR5 deficient mice display hallmarks of metabolic syndrome, which is absolutely microbiota dependent. This work aims to elucidate how a natural dietary component and widely used food additive drives HCC in innate immune deficient mice coupled with gut microbiotal overgrowth. Three specific aims are proposed, each of which investigates the mechanisms by which HCC develops in mice with gut dysbiosis. The three aims are interrelated, independently achievable and address the contributions of (i) structurally different natural soluble fibers, (ii) gut microbiota, and (iii) host hepatic lipogenesis/lipolysis to the development of HCC. This proposal has potential implications for public health, given the prevalent and overuse of inulin in the food industry. Our work would elucidate the underappreciated potential detrimental effects of inulin and/or SCFAs. Further, human HCC is the sixth most common cancer and third most cause of cancer related deaths globally. The higher mortality rates in patients with HCC are due to poor and late stage diagnosis because of its heterogeneous and asymptomatic nature. This warrants a novel, hepatocarcinogen independent model to better understand human HCC. This proposal seeks to fulfill this constraint."

Strong Institutional support combined with federal dollars through the COBRE Program will ensure an outstanding program which will meet the ongoing needs of infants, children and adolescents with SCD and their families in Delaware. In addition, the research proposed will have a significant impact not only in  the area of gene editing and in vitro stem cell growth but on SCD patient management in both the understanding and treatment of SCD related pain and stroke. The identification of the SCD affected family with high psychosocial risk will be also undertaken, facilitating appropriate evidence-based interventions that will diminish disparities in health care and outcomes."
"9607408","Project Summary/Abstract With this grant application we aim to dramatically improve over the capabilities of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) by developing a completely novel approach to measure human brain function. This is in line with the Brain Initiative FOA which aims to support early stage development of entirely new and novel noninvasive human brain imaging technologies and methods that will lead to transformative advances in our understanding of the human brain.  To substantially improve optical imaging of human brain function, we plan to develop a wearable time- gated, small-separation, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) system. We will illuminate the scalp with pulsed long-coherence lasers and detect photons with a time-gated photon counting detector positioned at a very short distance from the source. The detector will be turned on at a specific time delay with respect to the laser pulses to discard the early arriving photons, which have travelled only in the surface, and detect only photons which have travelled longer paths through the brain. Each detected photon will be time-stamped with the number of the corresponding laser pulse. Detected photons will be averaged over ~200 ms providing both intensity and temporal autocorrelation function temporal changes to quantify cerebral blood flow, oxygenation, and oxygen metabolic changes. This strategy will:  1) Move from the traditional large source-detector pair geometry with the ?banana? shaped spatial sensitivity  profile to a sub-cm source-detector separation with much improved spatial localization;  2) Improve sensitivity to brain and reduce scalp contamination by collecting only the photons that have  travelled long paths through the brain;  3) Add the measurement of cerebral blood flow to conventional fNIRS hemoglobin concentration measures;  4) Recover functional cerebral oxygen metabolism changes from the combined hemodynamic measures;  5) Cover the whole head with a dense array of small wearable optodes to produce high resolution images of  functional hemodynamic and metabolic changes that at the same time permits measurements with more  natural behaviors than presently permitted with fNIRS and other imaging methods.  In this phase we will develop the first time-gated fDCS prototype using commercially available components  and custom circuits, test the wearable optode in human subjects and determine optimal design specification  for the final system to be developed with subsequent funding mechanisms.  Once the prototype optode has been tested, the technology has been demonstrated and the best strategy for mass production has been determined, we can move to full production of low-cost time gated fDCS optodes. The development of this NIRS technology will provide an unprecedented tool to characterize brain function in humans."
"9463764","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metabolic and innate immune responses, two primitive systems critical for the long-term homeostasis of multi-cellular organisms, have evolved to promote cooperative, adaptive responses against diverse environmental challenges. Conversely, over-nutrition associated with modern high-calorie diets often leads to mis-regulation of metabolic-innate immune interactions and the development of metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type II diabetes. Thus, there is a critical need to characterize the mechanistic connection and coordination of these responses. The goal of our research is to use the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a simple model system to uncover the origin of metabolic-innate immune interactions in order to advance our knowledge of diet-mediated metabolic imbalances in humans. In this proposal, we plan to characterize a novel interaction between the innate immune transcription factor NFkB and the insulin-responsive metabolic transcription factor Foxo. NFkB transcription factors, evolutionarily conserved regulators of innate immunity, are emerging as a critical node in the bidirectional communication and coordination of metabolic and innate immune signaling pathway interactions. Using Drosophila, an important model organism for the study of metabolism and integrative physiology, we have previously established a role for Foxo transcriptional function in the control of NFkB-mediated innate immune responses. We now provide further evidence that diet-dependent NFkB activity in the Drosophila fatbody (similar to mammalian adipose tissue) can also impact lipid homeostasis through the regulation of Foxo function; establishing a cellular Foxo/NFkB 'homeostatic module' that governs metabolic and innate immune responses through mutual regulation of transcription factor activity. Drosophila provide an invaluable, genetically tractabl model to characterize this module, as these signaling networks are conserved from flies to humans. Interestingly, the Drosophila fatbody combines functions of nutrient and pathogen sensing organs, highlighting the inherent association between metabolic state and innate immune function. There are three specific aims to this proposal: (i) To assess the role of fatbody-specific NFkB activity in the regulation of lipid homeostasis; (ii) to characterize the molecular and cellular interaction between Foxo and NFkB; and (iii) to assess the role of fatbody-specific Foxo/NFkB interactions in the regulation of nutrient- dependent metabolic adaptation. Using the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila, coupled with integrative molecular, cellular, physiological, and high-throughput diet-mediated approaches, we will define this interaction at multiple levels of biological organization. Exploiting Drosophila to explore th origin of metabolic-innate immune interactions holds tremendous promise for an enhanced rate of uncovering both novel disease mechanisms and pharmaceutical targets aimed at treating the underlying metabolic imbalances that lead to pathologies such as obesity and type II diabetes."
"9460175","Electrospun Gelatin Meshes with Multifactor Release to Promote Bone Regeneration and Prevent Infection  Bone grafts account for over 500,000 surgeries each year in the United States with the number of surgeries expected to rise due to an aging population. Although small defects may be repaired using autografts, large defects require treatment with allografts or synthetic grafts, which have a ten-year failure rate as high as 60%. Poor outcomes arise from non-unions due to inadequate vascularization, lack of osteoinduction, and post-operative infection. Although research has made significant improvements in understanding graft failure and overcoming single failure modalities, there is still a need to develop advanced treatments that address multiple obstacles simultaneously. The central hypothesis for this proposal is that clinical outcomes of bone grafting procedures can be improved with the addition of a mesh that both prevents infection and enhances bone healing through endogenous cell recruitment and vascularization. This multifactorial approach requires a single material capable of targeting multiple therapeutic pathways, each with optimal release profiles. To this end, we have developed a co-spinning process with in situ crosslinking of gelatin fibers using two synthetic modalities to generate electrospun meshes with multiple fiber populations, each with independent crosslinking. The mechanisms release embedded or tethered molecules at rates dependent on the crosslink density. The material allows for a range of fast (hours) to slow release (weeks) leading to a multitude of applications as a thin outer layer with temporal drug delivery of several factors. The investigative team has the necessary expertise in bone tissue engineering, electrospinning (Cosgriff-Hernandez), and anti-microbial studies (Cohen). Upon completion, the multifunctional meshes will have passed the initial in vitro screening to permit assessment of allograft revitalization in rodent and large animal models (future R01). Although initially focused on improving bone regeneration, there is broad potential applications in regenerative medicine where multifactor release with independent control of release kinetics of growth factors, anti-inflammatories, or enzymes."
"9251256","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For more than 40 years, the NCI has supported a clinical trials infrastructure program to conduct early phase clinical trials across the US. As par of its efforts to enhance, facilitate, and expedite the process of early-phase drug development, the NCI created the NCI Experimental Therapeutics Program (NExT), which represents a joint early therapeutics development program between NCI intramural and extramural teams/institutions to prioritize a pipeline of NCI-driven targeted therapeutics. The NCI has now developed a comprehensive plan to transform the NCI-sponsored cooperative experimental therapeutics clinical trials program from a series of separate institutions conducting early-phase cancer treatment trials to a new consolidated, integrated Program, referred to as the NCI Experimental Therapeutics-Clinical Trials Network (ET-CTN). The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPC) has been an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center since 1990, and the UPCI has been involved in the NCI-U01 Phase I Early Drug Development Program since 1999. We now propose to be part of the new NCI ET-CTN as a Lead Academic Organization with the following specific aims: (1) to conduct early-phase experimental therapeutic clinical trials using single or combinations of novel agents from the NCI-CTP IND portfolio; (2) to participate on investigational agent-specific Project Teams to define the drug development plan; (3) to investigate the PK/PD aspects of the experimental agents and establish potential relationships between dose, schedule, exposure, and biological/antitumor effect; (4) to develop statistically appropriate clinical trial designs, including integral and integrated biomarker trials, accelerated titration, adaptive designs, and other design schemes; (5) to investigate special study populations with hepatic and/or renal dysfunction; (6) to evaluate data from related laboratory-based studies that assess drug-drug interactions; and (7) to evaluate translational endpoints in clinical trials of investigational agents.         RELEVANCE:  As a Lead Academic Organization of the NCI Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network, the UPCI plans to leverage its significant experience and leadership in early-phase clinical drug development and facilitate the early-phase clinical development of novel therapeutic agents and combinations that are of high priority to the NCI and the national interest. The long-term goal of this effort is to guide future disease specific clinical trials tha may have the potential to change the standard of cancer care in the US and worldwide"
"9478166","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes (T1D) arises in genetically predisposed individuals as a consequence of the immune- mediated destruction of pancreatic islet insulin- secreting beta cells. The onset of clinical symptoms of diabetes represents a relative endpoint in the chronic progressive decline of beta cell function, and occurs when a preponderance of beta cell mass is lost. The Diabetes Prevention Trial -Type 1 (DPT-1) and Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Network have demonstrated that: 1) multi-center cooperative research in T1D can be efficiently coordinated on a national and international level and 2) T1D can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy in relatives of persons with T1D by the presence of autoantibodies and other predisposing metabolic and genetic factors prior to significant hyperglycemia. These studies have enabled identification of a large number of individuals at very early stages of disease. The TrialNet network is committed to further define the pathophysiology of the development of T1D and to conduct clinical trials of interventional agents that may lead to the prevention and/or amelioration of the disease.  Indiana University (IU) has been a key member of the TrialNet consortium since its inception in 2003, first as an U.S. Regional Recruitment Center for the DPT-1 study and then as a critical Clinical Center for TrialNet with a wide affiliate network, centrally positioned at the crossroads of Midwestern and Eastern regions. In response to RFA DK-14-016 we outline our accomplishments to date in TrialNet, with a particular focus on leadership in TrialNet trials and studies, our support of collaborative research, our recruitment and outreach plans (including use of affiliate sites in Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio), our follow-up and retention plans, and suggestions for increasing the network's cost efficiency. We demonstrate our excellent rates of screening of relatives of persons with T1D through the Pathway to Prevention Study; our solid enrollment and excellent retention for monitoring, prevention, new-onset, and long-term follow-up studies; and our affiliate network expansion by 9 regional sites. In addition, we are engaged in a program of biomarker discovery for prediction and monitoring of progression of T1D and are using the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute core resources to identify new patient populations and to explore research barriers to participant participation in open study protocols."
"9482723","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Discoveries in reproductive biology have had a remarkable impact in science and medicine, leading to several Nobel prizes in Physiology or Medicine in the past decade. Despite these advances in science that were produced by experts in the reproductive biology, the number of reproductive science trainees is dwindling at an alarming rate. To help reverse this trend, we have established this T32 Training Program in Reproductive Development from Gonads to Fetuses (RDGF). The purpose of this program is to tap the large, diverse and highly qualified pipeline of graduate students (PhD or MD/PhD) and postdoctoral fellows (MD or PhD) that matriculate at the University of Pittsburgh each year and recruit them to pursue training and careers in the reproductive sciences. This training program will enhance the recruitment of reproductive biology researchers into the unique environment at Magee-Womens Research Institute where graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, medical residents, medical fellows and junior faculty (119 total trainees) work side by side in state of the art research facilities and experience on a daily basis how fundamental research discoveries impact reproductive medicine and patient care. The overarching objectives of the Program are to select and recruit the most qualified candidates (3 PhD students and 3 postdocs/year) into the reproductive sciences and pair them with well-funded, productive mentors who are committed to the training mission of the program and the University of Pittsburgh/Magee. The program will provide trainees with the education, resources and technical experience to conduct impactful science, while adhering to the principles of responsible conduct of research and scientific integrity. Rigorous oversight and progress review of Trainee/Mentor teams will ensure that trainees are fully immersed in all aspects of academic career development, including career development coursework, publications, grant submissions and attendance/presentation at local and national/international meetings. Research productivity milestones (e.g., publications, grants and awards) combined with connections made in the reproductive biology community at meetings will set the stage for advancement to the next stage of career development. Full immersion of trainees in all aspects of their academic endeavors will endow them with a sense of ownership of their research productivity and increase the likelihood that they will be retained long-term in reproductive science-related careers. Graduate students (PhD or MD/PhD) can remain in the training program for a maximum of five years and postdoctoral fellows can remain in the program for a maximum of three years. However, our program requires that all trainees write and submit and individual training grant application during their second year of training. This is a valuable skill for a career in science and the turnover as trainees transition from institutional to individual awards will help maximize the number of trainees and impact of the program. We anticipate training a total of 6 graduate students and 6 postdoctoral trainees during the five year award period."
"9697467","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco and alcohol often are used simultaneously by young adults, and their co-use is associated with greater likelihood of a dependence diagnosis in adulthood, disease, and eventual death from both substances. With wide reach and engagement among users, social media offer phenomenal opportunities to engage young people in an intervention for tobacco use and heavy drinking, and to foster socially supportive communities in which individuals can help each other reduce risky behaviors and maintain these changes over time. Preliminary work by our group has shown that young adults have an interest in using Facebook to quit smoking and that an intervention tailored to readiness to quit would be well received. Funded with a career development award from NIDA, the Principal Investigator has developed the Facebook Tobacco Status Project (TSP), a motivationally-tailored smoking cessation intervention for young adults based on US Clinical Practice Guidelines, and we have strong preliminary results. The present study seeks to determine whether adding an alcohol component (TSP +ALC) can lead to improved individual or combined tobacco and heavy episodic drinking (HED) outcomes among young adults who engage in both health risk behaviors. Phase I will develop TSP+ALC based on focus groups with young adults who smoke and have HED (5+ drinks for men, 4+ for women), the existing TSP, US Clinical Practice Guidelines for smoking cessation, and National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines for changing alcohol use. We will then use Facebook to recruit and conduct usability testing with 30 young adults who use tobacco and alcohol and revise the intervention according to feedback received. Phase II will evaluate, in a pilot randomized trial, the feasibilit and initial efficacy of TSP+ALC compared to TSP, with 160 US young adults recruited online. Young adults who smoke and have HED will be randomized to receive TSP or TSP+ALC. Both interventions will assign participants to a private Facebook group tailored to their readiness to quit tobacco and deliver a 90 day intervention including Facebook postings and weekly The Dr. Is In sessions with a trained counselor to guide group sessions. All participants will be offered  2-week introductory supply of nicotine patch. Participants will complete baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up assessments online. The primary outcome will be biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at each timepoint. Secondary outcomes include days of HED, dependence symptoms, readiness to quit, and thoughts about abstinence for smoking and HED. Facebook data will determine patterns of engagement, types of posts that attract the most and quickest user activities, and the relationship between user activity and tobacco use and HED in each group. Results will be used to design a randomized clinical trial powered to detect significant effects across groups. This line of research will inform new digital substance use interventions for young adults with great potential for cost-effectiveness and widespread dissemination."
"9519782","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although close to 85% of frail women in long-term care facilities have osteoporosis and the risk of osteoporotic fractures is nearly 10 times that of community dwelling elderly, few are treated and studies are scarce. The potentially potent therapies for osteoporosis in the young may have more risks than benefits in fragile elderly. Furthermore, for the first time we have demonstrated in this frail cohort increases in bone mineral density may not automatically translate to fracture reduction due to compromised skeletal integrity, poor mobility and/or limited life expectancy. Therefore, fracture reduction studies are desperately needed in this vulnerable population. The goal of our proposed R01 is to perform the first fracture reduction clinical trial with a potent antiresorptive agent in the mot vulnerable long-term care population. With our initial R01 we demonstrated the feasibility of recruiting and monitoring, and its efficacy on bone mineral density and bone turnover in a cohort of 180 long-term care residents. However we observed an increase in non-injurious falls. The stage is now set for phase 2, a definitive fracture reduction trial which forms the basis for our R01. We postulate that in frail, institutionalized women an annual infusion of zoledronic acid, an antiresorptive therapy for osteoporosis, will: (H1) be effective demonstrated by fracture reduction; (H2) be safe; and (H3) identify baseline characteristics and concomitant bone structure changes associated with a favorable fracture reduction and bone density response to therapy. To address these hypotheses we will enroll 886 institutionalized women over the age of 65 in a 3 year, randomized, double-blind, calcium and vitamin D controlled trial with the antiresorptive agent zoledronic acid. Use of an intravenous, once yearly agent avoids concerns of oral bisphosphonate side effects, poor absorption and burden on staff. Participants will reside in the long-term care settings associated with the Division of Geriatric Medicine, University of Pittsburgh and will include women with multiple comorbid conditions, functional and cognitive impairment, and limited mobility. Outcome measures will include incident fractures (combined vertebral and nonvertebral), adverse events, safety, bone mineral density, and trabecular bone structure. Novel features include: 1) the first-ever fracture reduction study of a potent antiresorptive agent in the negelected long-term care population, 2) mobile lab for state-of-the-art assessment of vertebral fractures and bone density (safety assessment) on site, 3) an electronic surveillance system to collect adverse events in real time including falls, and 4) exploring the role of bone structure in translating increased BMD to potential fracture reduction. Moreover, we have a unique opportunity to build on our established long-term care intervention infrastructure and track record. This study will provide the necessary data regarding the effectiveness and safety of osteoporosis treatment in elderly, institutionalized women."
"9508281","Abstract Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood disorder and is associated with wide- ranging impairments and negative health outcomes, including those that persist into adulthood and have significant public health consequences. Children with ADHD are at increased risk for not achieving recommended amounts of physical activity (PA) and engaging in high rates of sedentary behaviors like media use. PA is found to improve cognitive functioning and decrease ADHD symptoms, but is usually not addressed in standard treatment for ADHD. In this two-phase R21/R33 application, we propose to develop and pilot an intervention to increase PA and healthy behaviors in children with ADHD using a family-focused treatment model. In the R21 phase (n=30), we will pilot a group parent intervention based on the front-line behavioral treatment for ADHD, parent Behavior Management Training (BMT), adapted to focus on increasing PA and integrated with mobile Health technology (i.e., wearable PA trackers) and social media (Facebook) support to increase engagement and longevity of effects. We will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and effects of the intervention to increase PA. In the R33 phase (n=80), we will conduct a small randomized trial comparing the novel PA-focused intervention with standard BMT and examine effects on PA, other health behaviors, ADHD symptoms and functioning, and family outcomes across a 1-year period. Findings will inform a future large- scale evaluation of intervention effects on long-term health and functioning for children with ADHD."
"9481844","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited access to care is a major contributor to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and unintended pregnancy for U.S. adolescents and contributes to significant health disparities, including rates of STIs that are 6-7 times higher for uninsured youths than for insured youths. Racial/ethnic disparities also exist, with African American and Hispanic adolescents evidencing    pregnancy rates that are 4 times higher than White youths. The emergency department (ED) represents an important but underutilized location for reaching large numbers of sexually at-risk adolescents with limited access to evidence-based care and there is growing support for use of the ED to improve adolescent sexual health outcomes. Because few proven interventions are available in the ED to motivate youth to safer sexual behavior and provide health services (e.g., STI testing, condoms), novel interventions are needed. Dr. Miller, a pediatric emergency medicine physician and the candidate for this Career Development Award, is committed    to conducting patient-oriented behavioral research to improve adolescent health outcomes, focusing on underserved communities. Together with a strong multi-disciplinary mentorship team, Dr. Miller has created a four-year career development plan which includes structured mentoring, completion of a Master of Science in Clinical Research, and focused training in the use of health behavior change theories to develop multi-level interventions, research methods and statistical analyses for behavioral intervention trials, effective counseling strategies for health behavior change, health care system and payment models, and responsible conduct of    research. Dr. Miller's training activities will be complemented by an innovative project that will facilitate practical application of these new skills. The goal of the project is to enhance and tes a previously piloted ED SexHealth intervention that uses a dedicated health educator to provide risk reduction counseling, point-of care health services, and referral for ongoing care. Following intervention refinement, Dr. Miller will conduct a randomized trial of the enhanced intervention versus a standard information arm to determine the effect size of rates of health service uptake and enhanced intervention feasibility. We hypothesize that the intervention will result in higher health service uptake and increased condom use versus a standard information arm. The    rationale is that it will produce the first controlled data on an intervention designed to improve adolescent sexual health outcomes using a novel and effective method of delivering care. We expect to use these critical effect size estimates to inform the design of a larger clinical trial o evaluate efficacy. Dr. Miller's training efforts will culminate in the submission of an R01 proposa to fund this trial. This training and research plan are consistent with the mission of the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the Healthy People 2020 objectives from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and the 2009 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference."

"9476889","The goal of this ongoing R01 is to chart the progression of pathobiologic markers of presymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and their effect on neural function and cognition in a late-middle-aged cohort enriched with risk for AD. There is an appreciable gap in knowledge about the temporal disease course in this age range that this ongoing project has been directly addressing with serial multimodal imaging including amyloid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, and serial cognitive measurement. In the next funding cycle we will add a new positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique sensitive to fibrillar tau [F-18]THK5351 indexing neurofibrillary pathology. In the prior funding period we recruited 179 individuals from a registry of 1,545 people at risk for AD known as WRAP (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention). We found that [C-11]PIB amyloid burden is detectable in 20% of people with parental history of AD at a mean age of 60. Baseline amyloid is more extensive in the presence of higher CSF total tau levels, and 2-year increases in PiB amyloid are significantly predicted by higher baseline CSF tau. The hypothesis for this renewal is that tau- related neurofibrillar pathology begins early (in accord with the neuropathology literature) in people at AD risk and its strategic spatial burden explains changes in amyloid, neural function and cognitive decline. Aim 1: To test the premise that amyloid burden is necessary but not sufficient to evoke preclinical cognitive change. We will examine effects of longitudinal amyloid and tau change on episodic memory trajectories over time in 235 at risk individuals including all subjects we previously enrolled and follow them over 2 years with advanced multimodal imaging and CSF. Aim 2: To assess the effects of tau and amyloid imaging on MRI and CSF indicators of neural injury and function. Aim 3: To develop a multimodal disease marker to maximize efficiency of clinical trials in preclinical AD. Following our work in creating tools for efficient clinical trials in MCI, we will extend these concepts to the pre-MCI phase of disease utilizing deep learning architectures with tau, amyloid and structural imaging inputs. We will also examine change over time in tau, amyloid and cognition as outcomes. As any of these features considered singularly may be affected by age, and as amyloid and tau may be `necessary but not sufficient' by themselves, a derived multimodal marker may have eventual clinical utility in enriching prevention trials with those most likely to progress, and increasing power to detect change attributable to preclinical interventions. Significance: Relative tau and amyloid imaging profiles have not been empirically established in the presymptomatic time frame and this information is urgently needed to identify incipient disease. No comparable studies exist regarding the evolution of tau and amyloid signal in the critical late-middle-age time frame of preclinical AD. This ongoing project represents a unique opportunity to examine the earliest determinants of AD progression, when treatments may be most meaningful."

"9479294","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The vertebrate central nervous system is formed with great precision into discrete yet interconnected structural and functional units that control anima behavior. Compartmentalization of the neuroepithelium into these functional units is facilitated by its exposure to signaling molecules secreted from localized organizing centers (Jessell, 2000; Hébert and Fishell, 2008; Scholpp and Lumsden, 2010). The zona limitans intrathalamica (zli) is one such signaling hub in the caudal forebrain that is the source of secreted morphogens, including Sonic hedgehog (Shh), that are essential for developing the thalamus into a vital processing and relay station for sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex (Epstein, 2012; Martinez-Ferre and Martinez, 2012). Mouse mutants that lack Shh in the zli and/or basal plate of the caudal diencephalon show significant alterations in thalamic progenitor identity and nucleogenesis (Szabó et al., 2009; Vue et al., 2009; Jeong et al., 2011; Bluske et al., 2012). Despite the importance of the zli for thalamic morphogenesis, our knowledge of how this narrow boundary between the thalamus and prethalamus is established as a major brain-organizing center remains unresolved. Central to the understanding of zli formation is the mechanism by which Shh transcription is activated within its prescribed domain. Studies from my lab have provided substantial insight to the regulatory landscape underlying Shh transcription in the CNS (Jeong et al., 2006; Jeong et al., 2008; Geng et al., 2008; Jeong et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2012). Experiments in this proposal will address the hypothesis that enhancers with overlapping activity in key brain signaling centers share a common cis-regulatory signature. Our preliminary studies have identified six sequence motifs that are highly enriched in a set of enhancers that coordinate the expression of Shh and other co-regulated genes in the ventral midbrain, caudal diencephalon and zli. In the following three aims, we propose to systematically evaluate the requirement of candidate components of the cis and trans regulatory network underlying Shh/zli gene expression (Aims 1 and 2), clarify the evolutionary origin of the vertebrate zli (Aim1), and determine whether specific alterations in the regulation of Shh/zli expression contribute to neurodevelopment disorders of thalamic function (Aim3)."
"9478088","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the revised version of the first competing renewal of a Program Project (PP) focused on investigating the role that age-related changes in autophagy play in the functional alterations and inefficient response to immunological challenges and to stress of old organisms. Autophagy is a basic catabolic pathway essential for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, regulation of the cellular energetic balance and an integral part of the response to stress. The components of the PP are four Projects involving 6 faculty members from 5 academic departments and three Cores that provide support to the research activities of the four projects. The projects share ideas, techniques and experimental models. Completion of aims requires participation of members from several of the projects. The PPG activities are reviewed periodically by a 6-member Scientific Advisory Committee. The long-term goal of the PP remains testing the overall hypothesis that impairment in autophagy mediates the functional deterioration and the inability to orchestrate an efficient response to stressors and to immunological challenges in old organisms. Building on the novel findings of the previous period, we propose now the following specific aims: 1) to characterize the involvement of different autophagic pathways, including endosomal-microautophagy (eMI), in the cellular response to stress with the focus now on proteotoxicity, lipotoxicity and genotoxicity  in liver, brain (P1), adipose tissue (P4) and immune system (P2, P3); 2) to determine the impact of age-related changes in the different autophagic pathways on the immune response (P2, P3), adipose tissue homeostasis and remodeling (P4) and in the organismal resistance to stress (P1); 3) to analyze the effect of different interventions that modulate the activity of different autophagic pathways on the metabolic changes associated with aging (P1, P4) and on the failure of two essential immune functions, antigen processing and presentation (P2) and T cell activation (P3). These studies will require the synergistic cooperation of groups with expertise in  autophagy, dendritic cell function, T cell biology, lipid metabolism, medicinal chemistry and oxidative cellular injury. Relevance: This PP explores the novel concepts that: 1. defective autophagic function is behind the higher vulnerability to stressors of old organisms and that 2. interventions aimed at restoring or enhancing autophagy could be implemented as anti-aging strategies to prolong health-span. Our studies may ultimately lead to fundamental insights in understanding, treating or preventing the metabolic alterations and declined cognitive and immune function of elders through manipulations of the autophagic system."
"9461999","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NIA Interventions Testing Program represents a multi-site translational research program to evaluate agents hypothesized to extend mouse lifespan by retardation of aging or postponement of late life diseases. Interventions proposed by multiple collaborating scientists from the research community are initially tested, in parallel, at three sites (Jackson Laboratories, Michigan and Texas), using identical, standardized protocols, and using sufficient numbers of genetically heterogeneous mice to provide 80% power for detecting changes in lifespan of 10%, for either sex, after pooling data from any two of the test sites. Forty such lifespan experiments, involving various doses of 25 distinct agents, have been initiated in the first nine years of the ITP. Significant effects on longevity, in one or both sexe, have been documented for 5 of the tested agents: aspirin, NDGA, rapamycin, Acarbose, and 17-?-estradiol. Initial lifespan trials are now underway for 8 agents, as well as comprehensive analyses of the effects of rapamycin, Acarbose, and NDGA on health and on cellular and physiological traits thought likely to mediate the beneficial effects seen. Plans for the next five year period include additional lifespan (Stage I) trials, detailed analyses (Stage II) of agent found to increase lifespan, and some increased emphasis on collaborations with other scientists skilled at evaluating traits related to health and disease or at testing ideas about mechanisms of drug action on aging. Each of the three ITP laboratories will bring special expertise to the effort measures of age-sensitive traits at the Jackson Laboratory, pathology and statistical analysis at Michigan, and pharmacology at the University of Texas."

"9493063","Project Summary Biomedical Engineering (BME) undergraduate students at Colorado State University (CSU) complete two B.S. degrees, in BME and a partner major of either Mechanical Engineering, Chemical and Biological Engineering, or Electrical Engineering. Throughout the five year curriculum, these students become proficient in math, biomedical science, and their chosen engineering specialization. Much of CSU's two-semester BME Senior Capstone Design course focuses on medical device design, and it is important for young biomedical engineers to spend time in the clinic to truly understand the environment and constraints that must be considered for successful design of medical devices. However, as a university that is not affiliated with a medical school, there are very few opportunities for CSU's BME students to gain significant exposure to clinical settings. The overall goal of this proposal is to enhance the existing interdisciplinary team-based BME Senior Capstone Design course at CSU by providing a summer clinical immersion program at University of Colorado Health Medical Center of the Rockies, a Level II Trauma Center. The recurring seven week full-time clinical immersion experience during the summer before senior year will be comprised of one week rotations through specific specialty areas: Anesthesia, Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, Orthopedic Surgery, Cardiology, Cardiovascular Surgery, Pulmonary Medicine, Neonatology and Interventional Radiology. Addition of the clinical immersion program during the summer before the BME Senior Capstone Design course will allow for the students in this program to participate in needs assessment and project identification as they work with clinicians to co-develop ideas that can be incorporated into open-ended senior design projects for that academic year. Such projects will be co-advised by a clinician and an industry partner, so students working on the project can benefit from expertise in both practical use of the device/technology of interest as well as the design and regulatory processes required for development of the device/technology. These experiences will better prepare students for competitive careers in medical device development and technologies, and the resulting senior design projects will contribute to advances in medicine and improved patient care."
"9459820","CORE E: MAGNETIC RESONANCE & OPTICS SPECTROSCOPY ? PROJECT SUMMARY Core E provides state-of-the-art in vivo assessment of mitochondrial energetic and redox state. This is made possible by applying Magnetic Resonance (MRS) and Optical Spectroscopy (OS) methods to intact animals. Because the cell environment plays an important role in regulating mitochondrial function in vitro assays of both energetics and redox will not fully reflect the local environment and function of the intact tissue, cell and mitochondria. To that end, we will use new innovative tools to reveal cell and mitochondrial NAD redox states (NAD+ and NADH) in vivo in addition to established measures of cell energy status (ATP, PCr, ADP, pH). This breakthrough in measuring NAD redox states permits measurement of intrinsic factors that underlie mitochondrial inhibition that comes with age and its reversal with a targeted intervention. Changes in mitochondrial energetics and NAD redox status are key aspects of the hypothesized mechanisms underlying age-related dysfunction and reversal by SS-31 tested in all three PPG projects. Therefore, assessment of these properties is an important requirement of the three PPG Projects that are based on enhancing mitochondrial function in heart, skeletal muscle and vision. Here we apply our innovative multimodal (MR and optical) approaches in combination with physiological perturbations to measure key mitochondrial functional properties that change with age and are impacted by interventions. These measures provide ? for the first time in vivo ? the critical measures of mitochondrial function that are the gold-standard in vitro: mitochondrial O2 uptake and ATP synthesis, as well as mitochondrial capacity (ATPmax) and coupling efficiency (P/O). These measures are made non- invasively in rodent models in muscle and heart in vivo. Our preliminary studies demonstrate change in cell energy state, NAD redox states and reduced mitochondrial function in these organs with age. Most importantly, these same techniques are sensitive to detect the impact of interventions to reverse the cell energy state reductions and redox changes, as well as improve mitochondrial function in old tissues. We will use this approach in to assess in vivo cell energy status (ATP, PCr, ADP, pH) and NAD redox status (cell NADH, NAD+ and mitochondrial NADH) by measurement of new spectroscopic signatures (Aim 1) and to assess in vivo mitochondrial energetics by measurement of mitochondrial oxidation, phosphorylation and coupling in vivo (Aim 2)."
"9478175","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite effective current therapies for Type 1 diabetes (T1D), significant risks of long term complications of diabetes exist. Multiple studies have demonstrated that autoimmunity associated with type 1 diabetes is found years before its clinical presentation and that T1D can be predicted. The goals of the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Study Group are to prevent loss of beta cells through study of the pathogenesis of T1D and trials of therapies to intervene in the process. To reach TrialNet's goal, successful Clinical Centers must maintain and develop highly effective recruitment approaches, encourage participation of subjects in follow up and prevention studies and carry out studies in a highly efficient and accurate manner. In addition, they must contribute to the overall mission by engagement in TrialNet activities and committees and adding clinical and/or scientific expertise. The aims of this application reflect our center's approach to meeting TrialNet's mission: ? To describe the progress and function of the Toronto Clinical Center as an innovative and effective TrialNet  site that has developed an extensive regional and national network with broad links in the diabetes  community. As a result, our site ranks 5th of 18 Clinical Centers in the number of subjects enrolled in  screening and monitoring phases of the Pathway to Prevention study with a very high retention rate of over  90%. Careful analysis of the effectiveness of recruitment approaches through the use of reports from  TrialNet's Coordinating Center and data collected by our site has allowed us to optimize efforts yielding an  increase in the number of subjects screened for the Pathway to Prevention Study over the past 3 years. ? To illustrate leadership and collaborative roles in TrialNet efforts such as Dr. Wherrett's leadership of the Study of Effects of Recombinant Human Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase on the Progression of Type 1 Diabetes in New Onset Subjects Study, management of all Canadian regulatory requirements for our site and the Canadian Affiliate Network, and our coordinators' roles in developing materials to support recruitment. ? To highlight approaches used to assist Affiliate Sites with training and specialized support such as screening event identification and development. Methods to enhance recruitment and cost efficiency through new links, optimize efficiency of IRB review through the development of shared tools for review and consent documents, monitor the success of recruitment efforts and study conduct are detailed. A proposal for a fellowship to support new clinical researchers in type 1 diabetes is described."
"9481800","Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) carries a high risk of progression to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, there are currently no effective treatments. For older adults with MCI, the cognitive problems and uncertainty they face negatively impacts their everyday functioning, capacity and confidence to engage in challenging cognitive activities, and thus their quality of life. A substantial proportion of adults with MCI either take cholinesterase inhibitors or have tried them, but the low efficacy of these approved treatments for AD appears outweighed by their side effects. The goal of this study is to test the efficacy of a non-pharmacological treatment for MCI that involves noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS). Early studies in AD dementia patients have found that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS, a form of NIBS) improved global cognitive function and activities of daily living. Given that in AD, neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction progress along brain networks, these early studies of brain stimulation in AD dementia suggest there is sufficient neuroplasticity for efficacious effects of brain stimulation. Of the very few rTMS studies in MCI that have been published, the effect size appears to be moderately large. However, it is not clear whether the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the stimulation site used in most of the prior MCI/AD rTMS trials, is the optimal site for achieving the most efficacious effects including effects on episodic memory. Importantly, when other investigators used rTMS to stimulate a lateral parietal cortical (LPC) site in healthy young adults, significant effects of rTMS on memory were measurable weeks later. Moreover, functional connectivity of brain regions was selectively increased, including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a ?hub? of brain networks that is affected in amnestic MCI. Because stimulation of the DLPFC and the LPC may each have distinct effects, we designed this pilot trial to have two active rTMS treatment groups: DLPFC and LPC. A third group, a sham-control, will also be included to achieve a controlled, randomized, double-blind trial. For each of the three groups, stimulation will be bilateral, based on effects achieved in the AD studies. The primary hypothesis is that active rTMS (to either site of stimulation) will be superior to sham-control in improving memory. Measures of change in functional connectivity will be computed to examine whether there is evidence that rTMS changes connectivity of the PCC with other regions of the brain. In addition to looking at effects of rTMS on functional connectivity and cognition in relation to the cortical site stimulated, genetic markers will be collected toward addressing heterogeneity of response. To track the durability of rTMS effects on memory, participants will be followed longer than in any prior study (up to 6 months after the intervention). If this study finds rTMS improves memory in older adults with MCI, further clinical development of this non-pharmacological treatment could ultimately improve the lives of millions of older adults who have MCI and are at an increased risk of developing dementia."
"9675650","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  The University of Pennsylvania Superfund Research and Training Program Center (Penn SRP Center) evolved as a direct consequence of concerns from the community living proximal to the BioRit Asbestos Superfund site in Ambler, PA. The community at Ambler has actively participated in the design of projects to be tackled by the Center. As a result, the Center will consist of two Environmental Science Projects and four Biomedical Science Research Projects, which will be underpinned by one Research Core and four Service Cores. These Projects and Cores will explore various aspects of asbestos fate, exposure, remediation, and adverse health effects. Environmental Science Projects 1 and 2 are entitled Remediation of Asbestos Particles and Mobility and Fate of Asbestos Particles, respectively. Biomedical Science Projects 3-6 are entitled Social Determinants of Risk And Attitudes about Asbestos in a Superfund Environmental Justice Community, Animal Models of Mesothelioma, Chemoprevention of Asbestos-Induced Lung Diseases, and Biomarkers of Asbestos Exposure The Cores comprise an Administrative Core (Core A), the Community Engagement Core (Core B), the Research Translation Core (Core C), the Biostatistical Research Support Core (Core D), and the Interdisciplinary Training Core (Core E). The goals of the Penn SRP Center will be accomplished through the leadership of two senior highly accomplished investigators, Dr. Ian A. Blair (Director) and Dr. Trevor M. Penning (Deputy Director). The Penn SRP is underpinned by four highly significant entities. First, the Penn Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) provides an academic home, with enormous resources to draw upon. Second, the CEET Translational Biomarker Core provides instrumentation and resources for conducting sophisticated biomarker discovery and validation studies. Third, the CEET Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core will provide support for human subject study design and storage of annotated biospecimens. Fourth, the existing CEET Certificate Program and T32 Training Program in Environmental Health Sciences provide a resource of potential students and postdoctoral fellows who could be recruited into the Penn SRP Center. Advanced techniques for the detection, assessment, and evaluation of the effect on human health of hazardous substances will involve the development of a new animal model of asbestos-induced mesothelioma. Methods to assess the risks to human health presented by hazardous substances will involve novel metabolomics methodology using high resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry will be developed to identify human populations that are exposed to asbestos. Methods and technologies to detect hazardous substances in the environment will involve two quite separate approaches. One will involve the use of earth science-based methodology to monitor the movement of asbestos within dump sites and the other will involve a sociological study to identify how asbestos exposure can occur and whether this can explain the cluster of asbestos-induced mesotheliomas in Ambler. A basic biological method to be employed for reducing the amount and toxicity of a hazardous substance will involve the remediation of asbestos by mycorrhizal fungi-mediated conversion it to a non-toxic molecular form. Therefore, although these projects evolved in response to the Ambler community's concerns (EPA Region 3), the results can be readily translated to the fifteen other asbestos sites that are present in five of the other EPA Regions (2, 5, and 8-10)."
"9493866","Fifty percent of all adolescents will use some form of illicit drugs before the end of high school, 20-25% will meet criterial for depression, and many others will engage in health compromising behaviors like delinquency and violence?with consequences for their long-term health. Evidence-based interventions shown to prevent these behavioral health concerns could improve adolescent health trajectories if implemented widely in pediatric primary care. The American Academy of Pediatrics? Bright Futures recommends that pediatricians offer developmentally tailored anticipatory guidance to all parents to support their children?s healthy development, but programs providing guidance are not offered universally. This UG3-UH3 application tests the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing Guiding Good Choices, a universal, evidence-based anticipatory guidance curriculum for parents of early adolescents, in three large, integrated healthcare systems serving socioeconomically diverse families. This intervention reduced adolescent alcohol, tobacco and marijuana use, depression, and general delinquency in two previous rigorous randomized controlled trials. It also strengthened parenting practices and parent-adolescent relationship quality, both broadly protective against behavioral health concerns. Guiding Good Choices has the capacity to achieve population-level impact on adolescent health if made widely available through pediatric primary care. Parents trust pediatricians? advice regarding their children?s well-being, and current research with socioeconomically diverse groups suggests that they are eager to participate in family-focused programs offered in primary care clinics. Building on this body of research, the investigative team, in close cooperation with the NIH Healthcare Systems Research Collaboratory and healthcare systems partners, will conduct a cluster-randomized trial of Guiding Good Choices in 72 pediatric primary care practices. Half will be randomly assigned to offer the program universally to parents of adolescents ages 11 to 12, and half will serve as usual care controls. The study will use a workflow that is easy to adopt, implement, and maintain by primary care clinics to enroll families in the intervention at the adolescent well visit. We anticipate recruiting over 4,500 families into the trial. The team will use the RE-AIM framework to test implementation outcomes and effectiveness, including hypothesized reductions in several behavioral health problems (e.g., substance use initiation, mental health symptoms and diagnoses), and emergency department and inpatient service utilization. We will use data from the EHR and a supplemental behavioral health survey to monitor outcomes up to 3 years post intervention. We will also assess the feasibility and sustainability of implementing the intervention in each HCS, including health economic evaluation to understand costs in relation to value gained. Throughout the trial the investigative team will engage in ongoing dialog with HCS leaders, pediatricians, and clinic staff to ensure the intervention and implementation process fit the needs of each HCS. We anticipate that evidence of feasibility and effectiveness in three different HCS will foster broad dissemination to achieve public health impact."

The meeting will assemble leaders in the field, together with junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students, to discuss the latest advances that analyze organization and function of nervous systems on the level of neuronal circuits in a variety of organisms and systems.  Computation in neuronal circuits is perhaps the major unresolved problem in biology and provides a missing link between genes and behavior. We believe that the problem of such magnitude requires joint efforts among scientists working on different organisms and systems. Creating such synergy served as a motivation for starting this biannual meeting series. By now, this is a well-established and highly regarded meeting in the community, which has an unusual inter-species flavor and focus on circuit structure and function. By its very nature, research presented in the meeting is highly interdisciplinary as it brings together experimentalists, theorists, and researchers from a range of quantitative disciplines.  The meeting will include sessions on sensory transformations, circuit computations, internal states, learning, motor control, and advanced techniques in neural circuits. Each session will be chaired by a leading scientist in the field. Oral presentations will be given by distinguished invited speakers as well as by speakers selected from submitted abstracts by a steering committee comprised of the invited speakers. Selected speakers will include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty, with the aim of maximal inclusion of young investigators and under-represented individuals. Of special importance are the two poster sessions, where many participants can present their work in an atmosphere conducive to informal discussion. The meeting will be of moderate size and we expect about 250 people to attend, the vast majority of whom will be presenting a poster or talk."
"9507374","Project Summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that affects more than 2.5 million people worldwide with an unknown etiology. People with MS can experience relapsing-remitting or progressive forms of disease, with the latter associated with cortical atrophy and cognitive decline. While MS is classically regarded as a disease of the white matter, recent evidence suggests that there is significant myelin loss in the gray matter of patients with MS. Cortical lesions are common in early MS and their increasing abundance during late stages of MS suggests that they may be an important therapeutic target. B cells are directly implicated in MS pathology, with recent evidence implicating IgG-mediated demyelination in pathology and the effectiveness of anti-B cell therapies in treatment of MS. However, mechanisms regulating myelin injury and repair in cortical lesions are incompletely understood. Progress in the understanding of MS has been constrained by the paucity of animal models that recapitulate hallmarks of the disease and inability to detect the dynamics of cortical demyelination in living patients. To overcome these limitations, we have developed both a novel mouse model of MS antibody-dependent demyelination and approaches to visualize myelin, oligodendrocytes, and their precursors in the living mouse brain. Here we propose to capitalize on these innovative approaches to discern the dynamics of demyelination and repair myelin in cortical lesions. The objectives of this proposal are: 1) Develop and evaluate a new model of antibody-mediated MS cortical demyelination and 2) Elucidate the mechanisms underlying remyelination in cortical lesions. This proposal breaks new ground by developing novel approaches to understand the mechanisms underlying cortical lesions that characterize MS and provide an in vivo mouse model platform that will allow for the evaluation of new therapeutic candidates for MS."
"9558198","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common of the interstitial lung diseases, occurs in about 128,000 people, with 48,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the US. The typical clinical course is a progressive fibrotic disease characterized by scarring and `honeycombing' of the lungs causing an irreversible loss of the tissue's ability to transport oxygen. Co-morbid pulmonary hypertension is commonly seen in patients with IPF and contributes to a worsening clinical prognosis. IPF ultimately robs a patient of the ability to breathe leading to a mortality rate of 66% at five years following diagnosis. This high death rate corresponds to an unappreciated large number of fatalities per year (n=40,000), about the same yearly rate as deaths due to breast cancer. Current treatments have mainly focused on blocking proliferation of lung fibroblasts. A novel target?Protease-Activated Receptor-2 (PAR2)?has recently been identified as an important mediator in the pathogenesis of IPF. PAR2 is a cell surface receptor that is upregulated in reactive lung epithelium, fibroblasts, and inflammatory cells during progression of IPF, and IPF patients with high expression of PAR2 in the lung have worse survival and clinical indices. Increased pro-coagulant protease (factors VIIa/Xa/TF) activity in the lung, and local inflammatory proteases such as mast cell tryptase trigger aberrant PAR2 signaling and activation of the fibrotic response. The goal of this Oasis fast-track STTR proposal is based on our discovery of a PAR2 inhibitor, OA-235c, as a potent suppressor of aberrant lung fibrotic processes. The cell-penetrating, lipidated inhibitor OA-235c, was developed using our proprietary PepducinTM technology. PepducinTM technology offers a unique opportunity to target the intracellular surface of recalcitrant G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as PAR2 with exquisite specificity, potency and long half-lives, with prolonged drug exposure to the target tissue, namely lung. In pre-clinical studies, we show that OA-235c significantly suppresses fibrosis and inflammation in IPF and other fibrotic-organ models. In preliminary toxicology studies, OA-235c was safe and tolerated in dogs, rats, and mice with no evidence of pancreas, liver, heart, kidney, lung, bone marrow, or other organ toxicity or any laboratory abnormalities at high multiples of the therapeutic dose. Oasis Pharmaceuticals successfully preformulated and produced OA-235c at 98% purity and high chemical and proteolytic stability. Phase 1 (Aim 1) will identify and validate a formulation at 50-100 mg/mL solubility for OA-235c and demonstrate significant suppression of lung fibrosis and determine any drug-drug interactions with the two standard-of-care IPF agents. The goal of Phase 2 (Aim 2) will be to complete the IND Data Package under GLP conditions with GMP OA-235c with submission of the IND to the FDA as the final milestone. Rapid completion of the proposed preclinical and IND-enabling studies would generate a novel drug candidate with an anti-fibrotic mode of action for the potential treatment of IPF in patients."
"9485965","The development of the core facilities has been a learning experience for the PI of the NO INBRE. The major lesson learned since initial funding of the NO INBRE is that in a low population, large land mass state with a limited investigator base, one must develop core facilities that provide services that cannot be purchased through commercial entities. This certainly applies to flow and cell sorting since there is no other facility capable of sorting cells in the entire state of North Dakota. Likewise, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to perform flow through commercial entities or at academic centers distant from one's home laboratory. This is especially true for the sorting of cells, where in most instances immediate processing and/or culture of the product is necessary. A prime example of this situation is in the cutting-edge technology of stem cells, where research in this area is difficult, if not impossible, without the ability to sort and capture the resulting cells for culture and/or analysis. The NO INBRE has identified this core as essential for the further development of research, teaching and service in NO. Simply stated, at some juncture in their undergraduate career, every undergraduate student destined to enter the graduate student or health professional pipeline should have been exposed to flow and cell sorting. The same is true for graduate students destined for postdoctoral fellowships and medical students progressing to residencies."
"9431701","Project Summary/Abstract The ability to update strategies as contingencies change, or cognitive flexibility, is a fundamental behavioral process that allows for maximizing positive, while minimizing aversive, outcomes. This process is critical for survival, and its dysregulation is a hallmark of a number neuropsychiatric disorders including addiction. For example, cocaine addicts have a slowed ability to learn new associations, and also make risky choices despite environmental cues indicating that more advantageous choices are available. These deficits are similar to those seen in patients with damage to prefrontal cortical areas, and imagining studies in cocaine addicts also suggests that cocaine-induced plasticity in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) may be involved. While hypotheses as to the circuit basis of cocaine-induced cognitive deficits have been generated from clinical studies, in many cases we lack direct, mechanistic preclinical data verifying these hypotheses. In our preliminary studies in rats we have identified two projection-defined subpopulations in the mPFC, cells that project to the nucleus accumbens or those that project to the periaqueductal gray area, which divergently encode positive and negative stimuli. We hypothesize that these populations are involved in cognitive flexibility, and its dysregulation by cocaine. The experiments put forth in this proposal will systematically test this hypothesis by combining single-cell calcium imaging, to record endogenous activity, and optogenetics, to manipulate activity, with intravenous cocaine self- administration. The cutting-edge technologies employed in this proposal will allow us to test the novel hypothesis that specific subpopulations in the mPFC are critically involved in fundamental behavioral control, cognitive flexibility, and cocaine-induced deficits in these processes. A successful outcome of this proposal will facilitate my transition to an independent academic position, while advancing our understanding of the circuit basis of cocaine addiction."

The long-term goal of our project is to elucidate the computations and interactions among brain areas subserving integration of cognitive information across space and time. As a paradigmatic example of cognitive integration, we focus on the problem of visual pattern completion. We can make cognitive inferences and recognize heavily occluded objects from partial information. Cognitive integration must act over time (e.g. comparing current states with past ones), across space (e.g. evaluating signals across different parts of the visual field) and across brain areas (e.g. simultaneously considering bottom-up inputs in the context of prior knowledge). To further our understanding of the neural circuits orchestrating pattern completion, here we record intracranial field potentials from temporal and frontal cortex through electrodes implanted in epilepsy patients for clinical reasons while they perform visual recognition tasks. By virtue of the high resolution of our recordings, we aim to elucidate the circuits, brain areas and dynamic interactions across areas involved in spatiotemporal integration during pattern completion. The results from these investigations will provide initial steps to characterize and constrain the fundamental problem of how information is integrated by cortical circuits."
"9461087","PROJECT SUMMARY Elaborations of unactivated carbon centers are among the most demanding reactions that enzymes catalyze. These reactions generally involve radical intermediates, often produced by strategic abstraction of substrate hydrogen atoms (H·). A prevalent strategy to cleave C?H bonds possessing homolytic bond-dissociation energies (BDEs) in excess of 95 kcal/mol involves intermediates derived from the reaction of O2 with transition metal cofactors. A distinct strategy, predominant in the anaerobic world and still important in aerobes, employs a 5'-deoxyadenosyl 5'-radical as the H· abstractor. This radical is generated via the homolysis of adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) or the reductive cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Those enzymes employing SAM to catalyze radical-dependent reactions belong to the so-called radical SAM (RS) superfamily, which contains almost 114,000 individual sequences that encompass at least 65 distinct reactions. Moreover, the number of enzymes and reactions catalyzed by members of the superfamily are increasing at an amazing pace as sequences of new genomes become available. The work described herein builds on and advances work from our laboratory on the characterization of some of the most novel reactions within the superfamily, including those involved in tRNA and ribosome modification, lipoic acid biosynthesis, the biosynthesis of several antibiotics, and antibiotic resistance. Specific objectives will be to i) elucidate how methylation of unactivated carbon and phosphorus atoms takes place, and provide rationale for the strategy employed for each type of methyl acceptor; ii) formulate methods to determine substrates for the many unannotated radical SAM methylases; iii) elucidate how iron-sulfur clusters are used as sources of sulfur atoms during sulfur insertion reactions and to determine how they are resynthesized after each turnover; iv) elucidate the pathway for the biosynthesis of the thiopeptide antibiotic, nosiheptide; and v) begin to characterize several radical SAM enzymes from humans that play important roles in health and disease."
"9475143","OVERALL ABSTRACT. The goal of this Program Project (P01) Grant is to provide much needed information regarding the mechanisms underlying age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, often referred to as sarcopenia. Studies from our team show that mice deficient in copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD, Sod1KO mice) display progressive declines in muscle structure and function throughout early adulthood, such that by middle age the Sod1KO mice resemble very old wild type mice. These findings support a mechanistic link between chronic oxidative stress and sarcopenia. A key feature of the initiation of muscle declines with aging and in Sod1KO mice is the degeneration of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). To probe the importance of pre- and post-synaptic factors in sarcopenia, we developed new mouse models with nerve- or muscle-specific deficiency of Sod1 or with Sod1 restored in neurons of Sod1KO mice. These mice have produced several key findings: 1-partial rescue of CuZnSOD only in neurons of Sod1KO mice prevented premature muscle atrophy, 2-deficiency of CuZnSOD only in neurons caused less severe atrophy than is observed in Sod1KO mice, and 3-lack of CuZnSOD only in muscle resulted in weakness without atrophy. These data indicate that motor neuron deficits arising from an oxidized redox status are critical in sarcopenia, but reduction of Sod1 in either neurons or skeletal muscle alone does not replicate the phenotype of Sod1KO mice, suggesting an interactive effect between both muscle and neural tissues. Thus, our objective is to critically test this ?two-hit? mechanism for sarcopenia. We hypothesize that (1) defects in neuronal function arising from altered redox homeostasis, due to Sod1 deficiency or aging, initiate disruption of NMJs resulting in muscle mitochondrial dysfunction; and (2) under circumstances of impaired ability of muscles to maintain mitochondrial function, resultant changes in ROS, calcium, and/or inflammation will feed back to further impair maintenance of the NMJ. We will address this hypothesis in a set of highly integrated Aims that will determine 1. the impact of altered redox homeostasis in motor neurons on NMJ formation and function, 2. whether NMJ degeneration and increased ROS generation by muscle mitochondria (mtROS) are necessary to induce sarcopenia, and 3. the role of muscle mtROS, calcium, and inflammation in the weakness and muscle fiber loss. We will achieve these Aims through three synergistic Projects supported by Administrative and Animal Resource Cores that are key to the success of this interactive P01 that relies on shared animal models, frequent contact, and highly collaborative science."

"9478544","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This T32 application seeks to equip pediatric rheumatology fellows with the investigative skills necessary to succeed in meaningful scientific careers in academic pediatric rheumatology. The program is based in a large Division of Pediatric Rheumatology (PR) with several center grants (P30, P01) and NIH-funded investigators. The Pediatric Rheumatology Division, including its related clinic, is part of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) and The Children's Hospital Research Foundation (TCHRF), as well as part of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine (UCCOM) with its clinical and biomedical science departments. The Pediatric Rheumatology divisional research program draws strength from uniquely integrated teams of clinical, translational and basic researchers involved in active ongoing collaborations with members of Divisions of Immunobiology, Human Genetics, Hematology/Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation, Nephrology, Pharmacology, Radiology, Psychology and Bioinformatics. The primary faculty advisors were selected from 15 specialties divisions based on the ongoing collaboration with Rheumatology faculty, high research productivity and strong record of training of young scientists. Although the main emphasis will be placed on MD and MD/PhD trainees in the PR Fellowship Program, PhD candidates with strong interest in translational research in pediatric rheumatologic diseases will be sought as well. The majority of trainees will focus their research and training activities in one of the two special emphasis areas of strength, unique to the CCHMC research center and the Division of Rheumatology: (1) application of bioinformatics and omics technologies including genomics, epigenetics, proteomics, and metabolomics to advance translational research related to pediatric rheumatology, and (2) clinical epidemiology, development of clinical outcome assessment tool and clinical trial design. The program is well supported by core facilities as well as by academic courses, including a mandatory course in medical ethics. Other available courses include computational system biology, immunobiology, molecular genetics, and epidemiology and biostatistics. The interdepartmental Immunobiology Graduate Program (MS and PhD) that is centered at CCHMC complements existing programs in Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and Education in the UCCOM. It is believed that this Training Program for Pediatric Rheumatic Disease Research provides unique resources and will continue to enlarge the pool of individuals with a career interest in biomedical science as it relates to pediatric rheumatology, a pool that is far too small to meet the requirements of the next decades as molecular medicine is increasingly applied in the clinic."
"9519781","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study will use qualitative methods to understand barriers to and facilitators of re-housing older homeless adults (aged 50 and older) with members of their family. The proportion of homeless adults age 50 and older has grown at a rate exceeding the general population for the past two decades. Despite extensive evidence demonstrating the severe deleterious effects of homelessness on health, gaps exist in identifying housing strategies for older homeless adults. The NIA funded R01, Aging among the homeless: geriatric conditions, health and healthcare outcomes, (AG041860, PI Kushel) a longitudinal study of 350 older homeless adults, will serve as the parent study to the proposed project. In the Aging Homeless Study, a large proportion of older homeless adults have frequent and on-going contact with family members; approximately one-third were temporarily housed with family for a week or longer in the prior six months, most homeless participants expressed a willingness to live with family and a belief that their family members would allow them. This combination of temporary housing with family and willingness to continue has raised questions as to whether steps could be taken to make these temporary housing situations permanent. Existing interventions to promote older individuals' ability to thrive in the community bolster social ties, as loneliness and social isolation are associated with higher rates of chronic medical conditions, cognitive decline, and mortality. The proposed project will examine whether re-housing with family members is an effective means to promote re-housing and support older homeless adults' existing social ties. We propose to adapt the social-ecological model to address the following specific aims: Aim 1: To understand the factors influencing older homeless adults' ability to live with housed family members from the perspective of both older homeless adults and their family members. Aim 2: To understand the factors influencing older homeless adults' ability to live with housed family members from the perspective of key programmatic and policy stakeholders. Aim 3: To develop a toolkit addressing the barriers and facilitators to housing older homeless adults with family members for clinicians, homeless services providers, low-income housing program leaders and policy makers. To address Aims 1 and 2, we will conduct one-to-one qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of older homeless adults enrolled in the parent study, their family members, and service providers and policy stakeholders. We will conduct ethnographic participant observation in family members' home environments. Qualitative data will be transcribed, coded and analyzed using grounded theory methodologies by the multidisciplinary research team, consisting of an internationally recognized researcher of health for homeless populations (Principal Investigator), a medical anthropologist (Principal Investigator), and an epidemiologist with expertise in transitional science (Co-investigator). For Aim 3, we will synthesize study data and develop the toolkit to provide guidance about re-housing older homeless adults with family members."

"9695624","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Her2 is expressed in ~25% of breast cancers and correlates with highly aggressive disease. Her2-targeted therapies are highly efficacious against Her2-positive cancer, yet no clinical imaging agents can assess Her2 status in vivo. EvoRx Technologies has developed a method to discover cyclic peptides that have antibody-like affinities and selectivities, high stability in serum, and rapid systemic clearance. In our Phase I contract, we showed that EVO- 004 has rapid, high levels of tumor uptake with minimal background in mouse models, developed an efficient, automated radiochemical synthesis, and obtained preliminary PET/CT images in mice showing specific tumor uptake as well as rapid clearance and low liver uptake.  In Phase II, we aim to complete pre-clinical experiments, enabling first-in-human PET/CT imaging studies with EVO-004. We will use mouse model imaging studies of primary and metastatic cancer models to establish the sensitivity and limit of detection for Her2-positive disease, optimize EVO-004 radiochemical synthesis for clinical production, perform GMP validation studies, and establish dosimetry in rodent and primate models to determine tracer toxicity and establish the maximum safe dose for patient trials. Lastly, we will obtain an IND to deploy our PET tracer in patients with Her2-positive inflammatory breast cancer to demonstrate safety and concordance with biopsy-proven Her2-positive disease."
"9476286","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary carotenoids are associated with many health benefits, including decreased rates of cancer and inflammatory disease. More importantly, pro-vitamin A carotenoids (such as ?-carotene) are essential for prevention of vitamin A deficiency (VAD), a global health problem causing blindness, greater susceptibility to disease, and increased mortality. Because of their health-promoting roles, substantial progress has been made in the metabolic engineering of carotenoids in plant-based foods. Most famously, golden rice was engineered with high levels of ?-carotene to aid prevention of VAD, which impacts hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Other carotenoids are also the target of metabolic engineering research, with similar, health-focused goals. The roles of carotenoids and their Apo carotenoid derivatives (e.g. vitamin A) are mediated by multiple biochemical mechanisms including light absorption, electron transfer, and isomerization and quenching of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In these roles, carotenoids are exposed to high-energy and oxygen-rich environments where they react forming carotenoid damage products that are hazardous to life. As an example, ?-carotene in plants is fundamental for protection of photosystem II against ROS. Damage of this carotenoid generates a highly reactive pro-oxidant that decreases photosynthetic efficiency, negatively impacting crop yield. In humans, vitamin A damage products cause macular degeneration, while oxidative damaged ?-carotene is linked to an increased incidence of lung and stomach cancers. Although the unavoidable formation of carotenoid damage products is well documented, their accumulation in non-stressed photosynthetic tissues is not. Interestingly, non-photosynthetic tissues of plants (where carotenoids are not essential) often accumulate carotenoid damage products under non-stress conditions. This is problematic for the metabolic engineering of carotenoids, as edible non-photosynthetic tissues are the target of these bio-fortification efforts. The formation of damage products in these tissues not only decreases the carotenoid content of food, but also hastens spoilage. The lack of accumulated carotenoid damage products in photosynthetic tissues -- where carotenoids are essential, but ROS levels are highest -- suggests the presence of an, as yet undefined, network of repair enzymes that mend damaged carotenoids. My recent publication uncovering a gene that is inversely correlated with the accumulation of oxidative damaged ?- carotene in photosynthetic tissues strengthens this hypothesis. The proposed pilot project will characterize the function of two putative carotenoid repair enzymes. The results of this research will greatly benefit the stable engineering of carotenoids in plant-based foods for the prevention of disease. Additionally, an important part of this project is my professional development as a PI. As such, I sought out a highly successful mentor to guide me during this early stage of my career by advising on research direction and dissemination, collaborative opportunities and acquisition of research funding."
"9440069","Project Summary Humans are routinely exposed to mixtures of chemical and other environmental factors, making the quantification of health effects associated with environmental mixtures a critical goal for establishing environmental policy sufficiently protective of human health. Advancing research on mixtures science requires innovation across a span of disciplines in environmental health: exposure science, statistical methods for risk estimation in toxicology and epidemiology, and risk assessment. Accordingly, this proposal structures three specific aims spanning the primary needs in mixtures science: exposure biology (the development of good biomarkers for environmental mixtures), estimation of risk associated with pre- and post-natal exposures to environmental mixtures in children's health, and methods for improving guidance values in risk assessment of mixtures to improve environmental policy. Specifically, incorporating the critical aspect of exposure timing, in Aim 1 we will (1) develop methods that integrate information from studies with highly temporally resolved information on exposure into studies with more temporally targeted biomarker measures; and (2) develop methods that incorporate multiple biomarkers of exposure at varying temporal scales within the same study. Armed with new temporally resolved data on exposure mixtures, in Aim 2, we will develop new classes of models that can assess whether either (1) exposure at one time can ?prime? an individual to be more susceptible to a concurrent or subsequent chemical exposure, or (2) exposure to a nutrient or other ?protective? exposure at a given time can buffer an individual's tolerance to chemical exposures experienced at other times. However, simply identifying chemicals that are bad actors evidenced through epidemiology data does not adequately inform public health risk assessors about ?acceptable ranges? of environmental exposures from consumer products, which is fundamental to regulatory guidelines. In Aim 3, we will develop new classes of models that incorporate and evaluate regulatory guideline values into analyses of health effects of exposure to chemical and nutritional mixtures. Essential to this project is access to motivating data from two on-going pregnancy cohort studies of child development. The PROGRESS study is a cohort in Mexico City. Teeth biomarkers from these children provide a high temporal-resolution record of perinatal exposures to metals. The SELMA study is a large pregnancy cohort in Sweden with prenatal endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) exposure and dietary data available, making it possible to test for the potential mitigating effect of good nutrition on health effects from EDCs."

"9437297","Sphingolipids (SLs) are essential structural components of membranes and provide reservoirs for critical bioactive lipids, including ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Whereas ceramide is associated with apoptosis and growth arrest, S1P commonly promotes survival and proliferation. The best- characterized targets of S1P are S1P receptors localized to the plasma membrane. S1P also can act in the nucleus by binding to and inhibiting class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), which are major regulators of gene expression. SL signaling is characterized by highly compartmentalized generation and targeting of the bioactive molecules. Substantial insight on localized S1P production and targeting at the plasma membrane has been obtained, but little is known about regulation of SL metabolism in the nucleus. This project involves investigation of proteins with potential roles in generating bioactive SLs in the nucleus. The work includes analysis of a neutral sphingomyelinase localized to the nuclear envelope (NE) that is required for myoblast differentiation, which may be integral to nuclear SL metabolism. This component and other enzymes with potential links to nuclear SL metabolism will be analyzed in a cultured myoblast differentiation model. Subcellular fractionation and lipidomics will be used to characterize the role of these proteins in regulating the dynamic SL landscape of the nucleus during myoblast differentiation, and in producing bioactive SLs including S1P. In addition, the potential functions of S1P in activating expression of myogenic genes as an inhibitory ligand for class I HDACs will be evaluated. Overall this project will investigate the hypothesis that the nucleus houses a distinctive SL metabolism that has a major role in myogenic differentiation. The work has clear relevance to muscle pathology in humans, since HDAC inhibitors including S1P have been shown to ameliorate muscular dystrophies in animal models."
"9463490","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Silvio O. Conte Center at the University of Washington is designed with a specific goal of understanding how stress-exposure can exacerbate depressive symptoms and increase the risk of a depressive episode in vulnerable individuals. Clinical experience has established a strong interaction between a history of unregulated stress exposure and the risk of mood disorders, but how the stress- mediators produce enduring changes in brain function that result in depressive symptoms is not clear. Novel therapeutics based on new insights to these mechanisms have the potential to enhance stress-resilience in this vulnerable population. The research aims of this Center are designed to understand 1) how the dynorphins, which are released in response to repeated stress, cause aversive effects in mice that have been suggested to be responsible for a component of stress-induced dysphoria in humans; 2) how the serotonergic inputs from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) that regulate the dopaminergic system in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) affect neuronal excitability and are changed by repeated social defeat stress exposure; 3) how stress exposure alters gene expression in the serotonergic neurons of the DRN; and 4) how repeated stress exposure alters the regulation by CRF of the dopamine release by VTA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). These studies in mice will combined the use of transgenic Cre driver lines, conditional gene inactivation, optogenetics, and DREADD techniques to selectively regulate specific components of the DRN-> VTA -> NAc neuronal circuit known to be important in mood regulation. The studies will use behavioral, electrophysiological and fast-scan voltammetry techniques to measure the responses mediated by the different components of the circuit. Both male and female mice will be studied to identify sex-specific responses. The Center will include translational studies that attempt to link the mouse studies to stress responses in Women with treatment-resistant depression. A plausible hypothesis underlying this clinical study component is that the inflammatory mediators affecting gene expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes may also be acting as stress-mediators in brain. For example, both cytokines and dynorphins regulate the serotonin transporter function, and a link between their effects on neuronal circuits may suggest novel therapeutic approaches. The UW-Conte Center will support basic science and clinical research, as well as community Outreach and Training missions in a coordinated and synergistic mode."
"9599627","ABSTRACT The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is one of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century. In particular, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are one of the most challenging organisms in clinical settings. Indeed, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium have been designated by the Infectious Disease Society of America as one of the ?superbugs? against which new therapies are urgently needed. Daptomycin (DAP), a cell membrane-targeting lipopeptide antibiotic with potent in vitro bactericidal activity against VRE, has become a key ?front-line? antimicrobial agent against these organisms. However, development of resistance during therapy is a daunting challenge. The major mediator of DAP resistance in enterococci is a cluster of genes (designated liaFSR) that encode a three-component regulatory system involved in orchestrating the cell envelope adaptive response to antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides. LiaR is the response regulator (LuxR-type) of the system whose activity seems to be regulated by LiaF and LiaS (histidine kinase). However, the specific regulatory role of LiaF in enterococci is unknown. Additionally, we have identified a cluster of three genes that are mediators of the LiaR response (designated liaXYZ). LiaX is a surface exposed and secreted protein that appears to be the main orchestrator of the LiaR- mediated cell membrane response by negatively regulating the LiaFSR system, controlling cell membrane phospholipid remodeling (a phenotype associated with DAP resistance). Additionally, the N-terminus of LiaX interacts with penicillin-binding protein 5 (a key enterococcal enzyme required for cell-wall synthesis in the presence of ?-lactams) and is likely to mediate the ?see-saw? effect (hypersusceptibility to ?-lactams upon developing of DAP resistance). LiaY and LiaZ are two transmembrane proteins that are regulated by LiaX. Our data indicate that LiaYZ are required for DAP resistance and that LiaY is likely responsible for changes in cell membrane phospholipid architecture. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of our proposal is that understanding the mechanisms by which LiaFSR and LiaXYZ orchestrate the cell membrane response against antibiotics would provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of antimicrobial peptide resistance and bacterial adaptation that could be exploited with novel therapeutic interventions. We plan to develop our experimental approach in three major specific aims. In Sp. Aim I, we will investigate of the role of LiaF, a transmembrane protein that seems to play a major and distinct role in the activation of the response regulator LiaR in enterococci. In Specific Aim II, we will focus on the characterization of LiaX as the master effector of the cell envelope adaptive response. Specific Aim III will assess the role LiaYZ as mediators of DAP resistance and cell membrane remodeling under the assumption that such effect is mediated through interactions with cardiolipin synthase, a major phospholipid enzyme. We expect to provide evidence for a novel biochemical paradigm to the cell envelope response to antibiotics and, potentially, new targets for drug development."
"9697464","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adverse early life experiences such as prolonged child neglect and abuse increase the risk of developing mental health disorders including substance abuse and psychiatric disorders in childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Understanding the consequences of child abuse and neglect on early brain development and neural processes that shape memories and guide behaviors based on past experiences are important goals of research aiming to improve prospects for successful treatment of abused children. Pathological reward-dependent learning within the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the subsequent dysregulation of dopamine (DA) signaling from the VTA seems to be central to the onset of addiction and stress-related disorders, suggesting the potential therapeutic benefits of selective intervention in this brain area in treatment of such disorders. A single 24h episode o early maternal deprivation (MD) in rodents is widely used as an animal model of severe early life stress. Studies using this model have provided a strong link between the dysregulation of DA signaling and a later propensity to develop stress-related disorders. However it is still unknown how early MD affects the reward learning processes in the VTA. In this proposal, we will test our hypothesis that MD triggers epigenetic mechanisms that selectively reduce expression of critical memory-associated genes that support GABAergic plasticity in the VTA, and these epigenetic changes in part contribute to the development of later psychopathology. Our preliminary data also indicate that MD selectively disrupts GABAergic plasticity in the VTA through epigenetic modifications of critical signaling molecules underlying this plasticity. We will use a combination of molecular, cellular, immunohistochemical, biochemical, epigenetic, and behavioral techniques in naïve, maternally-deprived (MD), and non-maternally-deprived (non-MD) juvenile rats to drive a mechanistic understanding of experimental MD that may be highly applicable to recovery of child abuse and neglect. Understanding the effects of MD on neurons in the VTA will expand our knowledge of an important but neglected part of the cellular basis of child abuse and neglect. Consequently, we will identify novel mechanisms in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, memory formation and DA signaling within the VTA that can be selectively targeted in a cell-type and circuit-specific manner in the period immediately following an episode of MD or other severe stress during early development."
"9475718","PROJECT SUMMARY    Alzheimer?s disease and other related dementias (ADRD) are widely acknowledged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older populations. There are racial disparities in prevalence, with older African-Americans being twice as likely as older whites of having ADRD, with more severe symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Treatment intensity of people with ADRD is well documented to differ by race, including differences in health services received such as medication use and end of life care patterns. For example, African-Americans have 1.77 times the risk of having a feeding tube placed at the end of life than white patients. While differences in patient preference across racial and ethnic groups are documented, one major gap in our knowledge is what role physician practice characteristics have on disparities. While disparities could exist because the same physician is treating African-American and white patients differently, an alternative could be that people of different races with ADRD are seen largely by different physicians, with varying experience with either dementia or racial minorities. Furthermore, physicians seeing minority dementia patients may be in completely different physician ?networks,? meaning minorities see physicians who have differential connections to providers with specialized ability to diagnose and treat people with dementia.    The influence of physician professional connections on behavior can be studied by drawing on methods developed for the study of social networks. Social networks are structural representations of social interactions and personal or professional relationships. For physicians, social networks consist of colleagues with whom they share information, which can be measured by inferring connections when physicians share patients. The goal of this R03 is to develop preliminary data and methods to study the influence of social networks of physicians on disparities in end of life (EOL) care delivered to white and African-American Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD. We propose to address these questions developing social networks of physicians who provide EOL care to dementia patients, stratified by race, and study how these networks are associated with the quality and racial disparities of that care. Thus, this R03 is designed to: (1) construct and summarize physician patient-sharing networks for dementia patients and describe the relationship between network characteristics of their predominant provider of care and end of life outcomes; and (2) elucidate the relationship between physician patient-sharing networks and the disparities by race in intensity and quality of care received at the end of life for dementia patients. With greater understanding of the relationship between disparities in quality of care and physician networks, this R03 will form the basis for future research at Dartmouth to inform new areas of health economic and services research, and potentially many other questions regarding physician influence of healthcare quality and use for people with Alzheimer?s disease."
"9475801","Although the importance of psychosocial screening in sickle cell disease (SCD) has been emphasized by the  National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and the American Academy of Pediatrics, screening is not currently  implemented in a systematic manner, due in part to the lack of reliable, valid, and culturally sensitive  screening instruments. The proposed mentored research will investigate the Psychosocial Assessment Tool  (PAT) as an acceptable evidence-based caregiver-report screener of psychosocial risk and resilience in  pediatric SCD. PAT items reflect theoretically and clinically relevant domains based on social ecological  theory and the Pediatric Preventative Psychosocial Health Model. To date, the PAT has been used primarily  in the pediatric cancer population. Given potential distinctions between SCD and pediatric cancers,  particulariy with respect to socioeconomic characteristics, health disparities, cultural factors, and the ongoing  burden of the disease, it is critical to establish reliable and valid aspects of psychosocial risk specific to SCD.  Part 1 of this research proposal uses a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the acceptability of completing  the PAT in a sample of 30 primary caregivers of children (birth to 21 years) with SCD. These caregivers will  be asked to provide qualitative feedback regarding their experience of completing the PAT, to inform the  need to modify the PAT to better fit the SCD population, rendering a SCD version of the PAT (PAT-SC). In  Part 2, 170 primary caregivers of children (birth to 20 years) will be recruited to complete the PAT-SC and  other clinically relevant outcome measures at three time points (baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow up).  Clinically important health and school outcomes will be assessed through the electronic health record and  school data, which will also be gathered at the three time points. Data analyses will include exploratory and  confirmatory factor analyses, tests of association of the PAT-SC and clinically relevant health outcomes, and  psychometric evaluations (reliability, validity). At the conclusion of the study we anticipate having an  acceptable and valid psychosocial screener that can enhance the delivery of evidence based care to SCD  families in order to reduce health disparities and promote wellbeing."
"9522908","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Researchers from multiple disciplines advocate the importance of understanding the role of early-life factors in outcomes in midlife and old age. Education, early family life, childhood health, personality, and lifestyle have been identified as factors that shape the life course trajectories of individuals and subgroups within populations. The scarcity of longitudinal panels that span childhood, young adulthood, mid-life, and old age is a major research limitation. The 26 years of life history collected by the Longitudinal Study of American Youth (LSAY) offers a unique opportunity to examine questions about the influences of early-life factors in members of the Generation X cohort. Since 1987, the LSAY has tracked a national probability sample of 7th and 10th grade students into adulthood. This proposal seeks funding to (1) maintain this panel as they move into early midlife and extend the interview protocol to harmonize with the Health and Retirement Study (HRS); and (2) examine three characteristics that distinguish this cohort from previous cohorts: their education-work trajectories, financial challenges, and exposure to technology.  Recognizing the value of extending the decades of previous work and federal investment, the first objective of this proposal to continue data collection with the Generation X cohort of the LSAY and to extend it into the Longitudinal Study of American Life (LASL) to monitor the transition from young adulthood into mid-life and to set the stage for subsequent tracking into pre-retirement and later life. This work will build conceptual and empirical bridges from the existing LSAY data base of measures of earlier life choices using items from the NIA-supported HRS and it will improve our understanding of the dynamic processes that occur during mid-life.  The second objective of the proposed work is to examine three characteristics that distinguish the Generation X LSAY cohorts from previous cohorts: (1) the impact of education on career choices and on cognitive choices during mid-life and about pre-retirement and retirement decisions, (2) the influence of mid-life financial pressures on Generation X adults associated with financing the college educations of their children and the possible financial needs of aging parents, and (3) the impact of growing up in the Electronic Era on information acquisition and life course decision making in later adulthood."
"9440096","Although African Americans are at elevated risk for age-related cognitive decline and memory loss? with double the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to white Americans?we do not sufficiently understand the causes of this health disparity, nor how to best focus future interventional efforts to remediate this health crisis among older African Americans. Stress, sleep deprivation, sedentary lifestyles, poor cardiovascular fitness, depressive symptoms, high body mass, and low education are all known risk factors for cognitive decline and AD; their widespread presence among African Americans, particularly in low socioeconomic communities, suggests that some or all of these may be key to the high rates of dementia and Alzheimer's among African Americans. However, little is known about the relative importance (and interactions) among these different risk factors for AD in African Americans. Additionally, there is a dearth of data on the neural changes that occur across the lifespan in older African Americans-- especially those at highest risk for AD-- and how these relate to behavioral and lifestyle risk factors for AD.  This revised R01 resubmission?including four months of pilot data from our R56 bridge award and retitled ?Risk Factors for Future Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease in Older African Americans??will address the aforementioned gaps in understanding minority health disparities in Alzheimer's disease. We will test 360 African Americans, ages 65-85, on a battery of neuropsychological, cognitive, health, fitness, genetic, and lifestyle assessments. Our sample includes 240 newly recruited participants as well as 120 legacy participants recruited during the current R56 grant. Half (180) will receive brain imaging using MRI, addressing the paucity of available neuroimaging data on older African Americans. Two aspects of our plans are especially innovative and significant to project success.  First, we address barriers to African-American research participation and retention through our ten-year history of partnership, cooperation, and trust with the African-American communities of Greater Newark through Rutgers University-Newark's African American Brain Health Initiative: A University-Community Partnership (www.brainhealth.rutgers.edu). Our long-term relationships with community-based organizations have been critical to our past successes and involve year-round programs for community outreach, education, and engagement that bolster our research recruitment and retention. Many of these efforts are funded through a five-year grant to the PI from the NJ Department of Health's Office of Minority and Multicultural Health.  Second, we address the need for evaluating and validating novel cognitive assessments that are sensitive to the earliest stages of prodromal Alzheimer's disease by having all participants complete the Rutgers Generalization Tasks, innovative cognitive assessments developed by the Co-I (Myers) and PI (Gluck). These tasks are derived from prior neurocomputational models of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus, brain regions disrupted in the earliest stages of prodromal AD. As these tasks are based on non-verbal animal conditioning paradigms, they may be especially valuable for tracking cognitive changes in our population, which is affected by low levels of education or verbal fluency. We hypothesize that deficits in generalization?the ability to apply previously learned rules to novel task demands and new stimuli?will correlate with, and longitudinally predict, cognitive decline and neural changes in prodromal AD. Aim #1. CROSS-SECTIONAL BEHAVIORAL ANALYSES: We will evaluate (1) how variations in health, physical fitness and activity are correlated with cognitive function, and (2) how the influence of these variables is mediated by education, social support, and genetics, in modulating the risk of cognitive decline and AD in elderly African Americans.!Predictions: Low levels of physical activity and cardiovascular fitness and high body mass, will be correlated with poorer performance on the Rutgers Generalization Tasks. Aim #2. NEURAL MECHANISM ANALYSES: Using multimodal MRI to capture brain structure, function, and  white matter integrity, we evaluate how the relationships in Aim #1 are mediated by neural mechanisms.  Predictions: Poorer generalization performance (and low levels of physical activity and fitness) will be associated with reduced hippocampal volume, entorhinal cortical thickness, intra-hippocampal and EC- hippocampal connectivity, and decreased FA and increased MD in the hippocampus and EC. Aim #3. LONGITUDINAL PREDICTIVE ANALYSES: To identify longitudinal aspects of the relationships  described in Aim #1 and Aim #2, along with predictors of future cognitive decline and progression to aMCI  and AD, we will test all participants at baseline and every two years thereafter (providing us data from three  time-points for the legacy R56 cohort, and two time-points for the newly recruited participants).  Predictions: Participants who progress to aMCI or AD will show early impairments on the generalization  tasks (correlated with neurodegeneration) prior to deficits in standardized memory assessments, as well as  being more likely to have a history of lower physical activity and poorer cardiovascular fitness. The proposed R01, building on our ongoing R56 data collection, will overcome current limitations to understanding the high rate of cognitive decline and AD in older African Americans, while providing further clinical and neuroimaging validation of innovative cognitive assessments, the Rutgers Generalization Tasks, which may prove useful for detecting and measuring cognitive changes in early prodromal AD."
"9546374","ABSTRACT Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint disease. Although aging represents one of the most important risk factors for OA, mechanisms leading to the aging-related cartilage degeneration remain to be determined. We reported that cellular homeostasis mechanisms such as autophagy and oxidant defenses are compromised in aging and OA-affected cartilage. In our recent studies we investigated FoxO transcription factors, which regulate expression of autophagy proteins and autophagy activation. FoxO3a in particular is known as molecular gatekeeper of cellular aging. We observed a reduction in FoxO mRNA and protein expression in aging and OA-affected cartilage in humans and mice. These findings support the hypothesis that ?Aging-related reduction of FoxO expression impairs protective cellular homeostasis mechanisms, compromises chondrocyte survival and biosynthetic capacity and leads to accelerated joint aging and initiation of OA pathogenesis?. This hypothesis will be tested in the following aims. Aim 1: Regulation of FoxO expression and function in chondrocytes. We will examine the extracellular regulators and mechanisms of FoxO suppression or activation and identify the responsible cis-elements in the FoxO promoters. Using in vitro models of FoxO knock down and overexpression in normal and OA human chondrocytes and cartilage explants from FoxO deficient mice we will examine the role of FoxO in regulating chondrocyte functions. Aim 2: The FoxO signaling network in cartilage. FoxO target genes are tissue and context specific. We will establish FoxO target genes in mouse cartilage and human chondrocytes by using RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ChIP-seq for histone marks. Integrative analysis of these datasets will identify pathways and signaling mechanisms that are regulated by FoxO. Aim 3: Role of FoxO in cartilage homeostasis, aging and experimental OA. Our preliminary studies show that conditional cartilage specific deletion of FoxO1 leads to abnormal cartilage growth postnatally and spontaneous OA-like degradation by 6 months. We will generate postnatal triple and single knock out mice using Acan-CreER and test them for aging related changes and severity of experimental OA. Aim 4: Protective effects of FoxO overexpression and activation We will generate mice that overexpress active forms of FoxO1 or FoxO3 in cartilage to balance the OA associated suppression and determine outcomes with respect to homeostasis mechanisms and OA severity in the aging and surgical models. This project will establish that aging-related reduction in FoxO expression is an early and critical event in OA pathogenesis. This will provide the foundation for therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating FoxO expression and/or activity to prevent age-related and injury-induced onset and progression of OA. !"
"9469509","ABSTRACT Obesity causes 300,000 US deaths yearly, but most treatments do not result in lasting weight loss. People who show greater brain reward and attention region response, and less inhibitory region response, to high-calorie food images/cues show elevated future weight gain (Demos et al., 2012; Stice et al., 2015; Yokum et al., 2011, 2014), consistent with the theory that overeating results from a strong approach response to high-calorie food cues paired with a weak inhibitory response (Wiers et al., 2007). This implies that an intervention that reduces reward and attention region response to such food and increases inhibitory control region response should reduce overeating that is rooted in exposure to pervasive food cues. Computer-based response-inhibition training with high-calorie foods has decreased attentional bias for and intake of the training food, increased inhibitory control, and produced weight loss in overweight participants in 3 proof-of-concept trials, with effects persisting through 6-mo follow-up (Allom & Mullan, 2015; Kemps et al., 2014b; Lawrence et al., 2015b; Veling et al., 2014). A pilot trial found that overweight/obese adults who completed a multi-faceted 4-hr response- inhibition training with high-calorie food images and response-facilitation training with low-calorie food images showed reduced fMRI-assessed reward and attention region response to high-calorie training foods and greater body fat loss than controls who completed a rigorous 4-hr generic response-inhibition/response- facilitation training with non-food images (d=.95), producing a 7% reduction in excess body fat over the 4-wk period. We propose to evaluate a refined and extended version of this response-training intervention. Aim 1 is to randomize 180 overweight/obese adults to a 4-wk response training obesity treatment or a generic inhibition training control condition that both include bi-monthly Internet-delivered booster training for a year and a smart phone response training app that can be used when tempted by high-calorie foods, assessing outcomes at pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups (e.g., % body fat, the primary outcome). Aim 2 is to use fMRI to test whether reduced reward and attention region response, and increased inhibitory region response to high-calorie food images used and not used in the response training mediate the effects of the intervention on fat loss. We will also test whether during training participants show acute reductions in reward and attention region response, and increases in inhibitory response to high-calorie training food images to capture the learning process, assess generalizability of the intervention to food images not used in training, and collect behavioral data on mediators. Aim 3 is to test whether intervention effects will be stronger for those who show less inhibitory control in response to high-calorie food images, a genetic propensity for greater dopamine signaling in reward circuitry, and greater pretest reward and attention region response, and weaker inhibitory region response to high-calorie food images, based on the theory that response training is more efficacious for those with a strong pre-potent approach tendency to high-calorie foods."
"9472985","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  During important periods of growth and development, animals are highly sensitive to their nutritional environment and can modify their metabolism, causing changes that persist throughout life. Poor nutrition early in life can lead to maladaptations that later increase the risk of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Recent studies indicate that early nutritional exposures may also directly affect longevity and cellular processes associated with aging. However, due to the costly nature of longitudinal animal studies, it is difficult to compare the effects of diverse dietary exposures an age groups. In addition, the cellular mechanisms underlying the effects of early diet on metabolism and aging are largely unexplored. This application establishes a novel platform using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate the role of early nutrition on lifespa and overall health. The proposed aims will dissect the fundamental epigenetic mechanisms and physiological changes that underlie the effects of poor nutrition during critical periods of development on metabolic aging. These studies will provide new strategies and genetic targets for pharmacological interventions that reverse the effects of poor early diet and potentially improve human healthspan."
"9485206","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research seeks to determine how adverse social environments influence the risk of inflammation-related disease by up-regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. These studies test the hypothesis that adverse social environments stimulate the hematopoietic production of immature pro-inflammatory monocytes (CD16- in humans, Ly-6c-high in mice) via threat-induced activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in bone marrow myelopoietic cells. Specific aims will: (Aim 1) Define the neural and endocrine pathways by which chronic threat up-regulates pro-inflammatory monocytes; (Aim 2) Define the specific beta-adrenergic receptors and target cell types mediating threat-induced expansion of pro- inflammatory monocytes; and (Aim 3) Define the myelopoietic molecules mediating beta-adrenergic expansion of pro-inflammatory monocytes (including GM-CSF, TGF-beta, and the CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine signaling axis). When complete, these studies will provide an integrated mechanistic model of the neural / hematopoietic pathway by which chronic adversity can up-regulate inflammatory gene expression in circulating immune cells. The overarching goal of these studies is to develop a comprehensive theory that explains how common social risk factors can influence multiple inflammation-related diseases. In addition to clarifying the basic physiologic mechanisms involved in defensive programming of the immune system transcriptome, these studies will identify specific CNS mechanisms (e.g., Crf gene activation in central nucleus of the amygdala), pharmacologic intervention strategies (e.g., beta-2 and beta-3 adrenergic antagonists, and antagonists of GM-CSF, TGF-beta, and/or CXCR4), and mechanistic biomarkers (e.g., myelopoietic molecules and circulating monocyte phenotypes) that can be applied in future studies to clarify how stress-induced up- regulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes impacts specific inflammation-related diseases such as atherosclerosis, Type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer."
"9601221","Summary T cells play a central role in antitumor and antiviral immunity. In chronic infections and cancer, constant stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) often leads to exhaustion of T cells. Exhausted T cells are functionally incompetent and therefore less efficient to clear viruses and tumors. Reversing T cell exhaustion, such as with anti-PD-1 treatment, is used as therapy for a variety of cancers. However, challenges for successful immunotherapy remain, such as low response rate and immune-related adverse events. Thus, understanding how T cell exhaustion is regulated will help discover novel therapeutic targets and improve current therapies for chronic infections and cancer. We recently revealed a critical role of transmembrane protein 16 (TMEM16) F in restricting T cell exhaustion. We found that TMEM16F-KO T cells become hyperactivated during the early phase of chronic viral infection. This overactivation ultimately leads to severe T cell exhaustion and uncontrolled virus burden. Mechanistically, we found that TMEM16F is required for TCR-induced formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), a process that downregulates TCR signaling to prevent overactivation of T cells. Our hypothesis is that increased activity of TMEM16F could break T cell exhaustion, a novel therapeutic strategy applicable to chronic infections and cancer. We will support our hypothesis with the following aims: 1) Elucidate the role of TMEM16F in regulating T cell exhaustion in cancer. We will challenge wild-type (WT) or TMEM16F-KO mice with B16F10 melanoma cells. We will subsequently examine survival, tumor size, and responses of tumor-infiltrating T cells. To measure antigen-specific T cell responses, we will establish a tumor model using B16F10-GP33 combined with adoptive transfer of GP33-specific P14 TCR-transgenic WT or TMEM16F-KO T cells. Mechanistically, we plan to study the impact of TMEM16F on T cell receptor signaling in vivo. We will also use a genetic mouse model to investigate TMEM16F and T cell exhaustion toward autochthonous tumors. Ultimately, we intend to translate the role of TMEM16F in T cell responses to melanoma patients. 2) Examine how targeted activation of TMEM16F affects T cell exhaustion in chronic viral infection and cancer. We will establish a retrogenic mouse model to increase TMEM16F activity in vivo. To generate a T cell-specific system for overactivation of TMEM16F in vivo, we will perform lentiviral infection and subsequent adoptive T cell transfer to generate P14-chimeric mice. Based on these two mouse models, we will explore whether overactivation of TMEM16F affects the development of T cell exhaustion and the efficacy of anti-PD1 blockade in the context of LCMV chronic infection or B16F10 melanoma challenge. Overall, our proposed study will potentially identify TMEM16F as a novel target for therapies against chronic infection and cancer."
"9474547","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary pathway by which telomeres are maintained in most species relies on the enzyme telomerase. In model organisms such as yeast as well as in human cells, continual replenishment of chromosome termini by telomerase is critical in order to ensure continuous cellular proliferation. The contribution of telomerase to human health, with regard to both cancer biology and human aging, is substantial. Telomerase activity is up- regulated in ~90% of human cancers. Conversely, genetically inherited reductions in telomerase function have a significant impact on age-related phenomena, encompassing a broad spectrum of telomere-mediated diseases referred to as syndromes of telomere shortening. However, despite the importance of telomerase, a unified model to explain how telomerase is regulated in vivo to maintain telomere length homeostasis is still lacking. This deficit stems at least in part from limitations of the current experimental systems that are widely used for telomerase studies. We have addressed some of the prior obstacles to telomerase analysis in S. cerevisiae, through the development of several biochemical assays as well as a novel genetic strategy that can target surface residues even in the absence of structure. In our first Specific Aim, we propose an integrated analysis of the yeast telomerase holoenzyme complex in which telomerase genetics, biochemistry and enzymology can be assessed in one experimental system. The proposed experiments are designed to identify new telomerase-interacting regulatory factors, determine how catalytic features of the telomerase enzyme impact telomere length in vivo, and examine how telomerase assembly and disassembly through the cell cycle influences telomere homeostasis. This analysis will be aided by a comprehensive panel of genetic reagents in the three subunits of telomerase. The goal is to provide a temporal and enzymatic understanding of how elongation of individual telomeres by telomerase is regulated in order to achieve telomere homeostasis in wild type cells. An understanding of telomerase regulation provides only an incomplete picture of the contribution of telomere biology to cellular proliferation, however. In the absence of telomerase, telomere attrition results in an eventual block to further cell division, referred to as replicative senescence. The development of a semi- quantitative assay for senescence that measures even slight differences in proliferation has demonstrated that proliferation of telomerase-defective yeast even during early stages of replicative senescence is controlled by multiple pathways. This points to a largely unexplored network that is likely to be as complex as the genetic interactions that regulate telomere length in the presence of telomerase. The goal of Specific Aim 2 is to define this genetic network, using a rapid quantitative assay designed to monitor cell proliferation in the absence of telomerase, combined with a single-nucleotide-resolution assay that monitors how the patterns of telomere erosion change in response to defects in different pathways."
"9536627","Project Summary Cellular quiescence plays a key role in adult stem cells by providing a pool of self-renewing cells that can differentiate into specific lineages to replenish cells lost from natural turnover or injury. Quiescence also protects cancer stem cells from many common therapies that target rapidly dividing tumors, and is postulated to be a major contributor to cancer relapse. Thus, understanding the regulatory mechanisms that contribute to the self-renewal, survival, and formation of quiescent cells has important implications for many aspects of human health, including tissue regeneration and cancer therapeutics. In this proposal, we will define these mechanisms using the model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where stationary phase has emerged as an excellent system to study cellular quiescence. Quiescent yeast cells represent a sub-population of growth arrested, non-dividing or G0 cells that can be isolated from a stationary phase culture in sufficient quantities for genetic, molecular, and genomic analyses. Like quiescent adult stem cells in vertebrates, quiescent yeast cells show extended viability and can re-enter the cell cycle when growth-promoting signals are restored. Moreover, the formation of these cells plays a key role in the regulation of chronological lifespan and cellular longevity. In three specific aims, we will use a combination of molecular, genetic, and genomic approaches to define the reproductive capacity of quiescent cells by following the temporal and spatial program of DNA replication upon re-entry of quiescent cells into the cell cycle (Aim1); the mechanisms involved in the repair of exogenous DNA to preserve genome integrity (Aim 2); and the histone post-translational modifications that play a role in the formation and survival of quiescent cells and thereby regulate chronological lifespan (Aim 3). The proposed studies could provide important paradigms for understanding the mechanisms that contribute to the formation and maintenance of quiescent cells in more complex developmental systems, and the relationship of quiescence to cell longevity."
"9478546","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and related approaches have identified >60 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk loci. Despite this, many alleles remain to be discovered to account for heritability estimates observed in families. We have published data that most common RA risk alleles are shared across diverse ethnic groups. In Aim 1, we will exploit this observation to discover new RA risk alleles - we will conduct a multi- ethnic GWAS of ~20,000 RA cases and 60,000 matched controls (Asian and European ancestry). We will also compare and contrast genetic findings across two ethnic groups, and develop new analytical methods. We have data (manuscript in press) that RA risk genes identified from GWAS harbor rare alleles that contribute to risk of RA. Together with data from other diseases, this leads to the hypothesis that causal genes at RA risk loci discovered by GWAS will contain independent, protein-coding mutations (most of which will be rare in the general population). In Aim 2, we will test this hypothesis by sequencing all genes (~650 in total) identified by GWAS in 1,300 RA case and 1,300 non-RA controls of European ancestry. We will also sequence ~2,000 RA case-control samples of Asian ancestry in order to compare and contrast genetic findings across two ethnic groups. We will perform genetic burden tests to determine which genes harbor more rare risk alleles in cases compared to controls than would be expected by chance. However, finding causal variants and genes is only the first step in translating genetic discoveries to improved patient care, and drug discovery in particular. We hypothesize that genes with an allelic series (i.e., multiple alleles that influence disease risk) re excellent drug targets, especially genes that carry loss-of-function (LOF) alleles that protect from disease. We have unpublished data on one RA risk locus that demonstrates our ability to progress from a GWAS to a high-throughput screen (HTS) of ~2,000 small molecules. In Aim 3 we will extend this approach to new RA risk genes: for at least one gene, we will understand the functional consequences of new RA risk alleles using cutting-edge molecular techniques (e.g., TALENs, RNAi), and use this information to conduct an HTS. Together, these three Aims will (1) discover new RA risk loci using GWAS in Europeans and Asians, (2) discover rare RA risk alleles at causal genes from GWAS loci (also in Europeans and Asians), and (3) translate genetic discoveries into new biology and an HTS of small molecule compounds. IMPACT: We will build upon our past accomplishments to perform the most comprehensive genetic study of RA to date (from common to rare alleles). We will develop innovative methods for integrating GWAS and sequence data, as well as innovative methods to use human genetics to guide drug discovery. Our team has all of the experience and resources to accomplish these Aims."
"9551476","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In this project, we will evaluate the trajectory of changes in regional oxygen consumption and glucose use (total as well as the fraction devoted to aerobic glycolysis or AG) and in brain circulation through the course of preclinical AD to symptomatic AD in late middle-aged and older adults. It is currently established that AG is a marker of a group of metabolic functions which includes biosynthesis, neuroprotection, and apoptosis, which, in the context of the normal brain is involved in synaptic remodeling, learning and memory, and generation of energy for membrane pumps. AG is about 10-15% in the normal adult human brain, and it demonstrates more substantial changes compared to other measures of brain metabolism in response to physiological activation or pathophysiological challenges associated with brain diseases. Our cross-sectional observations in cognitively normal adults suggest that areas of the human brain targeted by AD pathology have uniquely high levels of AG, and higher levels of AG are associated with less PIB deposition, higher levels of CSF A?42 and better scores on cognitive tests. In our current project, we will determine the role of AG as a potential early biomarker of evolving AD pathology and predictor of cognitive decline. Our specific aims include estimation for the first time of AG in individuals with mild-to-moderate symptomatic AD combined with that in cognitively normal individuals to evaluate a hypothesis that low baseline AG will be associated with the subsequent development of AD pathology and cognitive decline. We will also determine the relationship between the rate of change in AG and rate of change in clinical assessments and biomarkers of AD. In most cases, this information will be combined with the previously collected data in the same individuals to provide a multipoint trajectory over time. These longitudinal assessments will allow us to evaluate changes in AG and other PET measures of metabolism and circulation during the transition from no AD pathology to preclinical AD, and through the preclinical stages to symptomatic AD. We will evaluate the hypothesis that AG changes prior to other parameters, and that the rate of change in AG will predict progression in AD pathology and cognitive decline. Our work may not only expand significantly our understanding of the role of glucose in brain function beyond providing energy via oxidative phosphorylation, but also provide important new insights into the pathophysiology of AD and neuroprotective potential of AG. This project is innovative because it proposes to combine different biomarkers of AD to address novel questions, in vivo, in humans to produce findings relevant to both clinical disorders and fundamental human neurophysiology. The methods chosen, with which our group has substantial expertise, will allow us to study intrinsic regional brain activity and energy utilization, in vivo, in humans, which appear to be associated with the regional development of AD pathology. This project will evaluate a potential of AG as a highly specific biomarker of synaptic function, and provide novel insight into the development and control of the efficacy of preventive treatments aimed to reduce AD pathology by modulating synaptic function. "
"9525466","ABSTRACT This exploratory/developmental study applies social network analysis methods to Medicaid claims data on patterns of multi-provider care received by adults with serious mental illness (SMI). The goal is to identify characteristics of provider networks that are associated with patterns of care for physical health conditions, including quality of care measures and utilization of emergency department and inpatient services. Multiple policy strategies, including health homes and behavioral health based primary care, are currently being pursued to improve the quality of physical health care received by adults with SMI. These strategies directly target networks of care, but studies tend to evaluate them by assessing provider or patient level outcomes. However, systemic improvement is unlikely to occur through replication of a single model across all states and regions. Rather, solutions are likely to depend on characteristics of local or regional provider networks. Despite recent advances in measurement of the quality of behavioral health care, methods for identifying, characterizing and analyzing networks of care for adults with SMI have yet to be developed. This exploratory/developmental project will address this gap by addressing two specific aims. First, we will identify and characterize networks of providers who treat adults with SMI in the Medicaid enrolled population in three states. This will be accomplished using social network analysis methods which infer relationships among providers based on their participation in the treatment of the same patients. Provider networks will then be characterized with respect to common network metrics such as their size (e.g. number of providers), geographic location (urban vs. rural), diversity (number of distinct provider types), density (proportion of patients that are shared), and composition (e.g. includes a hospital or hospital based clinic). This analysis, which will be the first to examine networks of care treating adults with SMI, will produce the basic descriptive foundation for the development of integrated care measures. Second, using the identified networks we will examine associations between network-level measures and the quality of care for physical health conditions and utilization of emergency department and inpatient services. The network-based measures developed in this project will advance research and provide policy-makers with new tools for promoting system integration. This project will thereby improve the effectiveness of efforts to reduce the 8-year disparity in life expectancy faced by adults with SMI. To maximize the impact of this work, detailed specifications of the final measures will be published for public use. Finally, results from this project will enable future research projects to investigate important aspects of health care delivery systems for adults with SMI that have not previously been studied."
"9691020","Project Summary We seek support for a postdoctoral training program in Recovery and Restoration of Brain Health and Function following acute brain injury due to stroke or trauma to be administered by the Department of Neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital. Combining the expertise of the clinical neurosciences at MGH and the Brown Institute for Brain Science at Brown University, this program will fill a pressing need for clinician-scientists and neuroengineers trained to leverage the computational neurosciences and to develop device-based interventions on behalf of patients who survive disabling brain injuries. The program will involve active participation by an accomplished, experienced, and multidisciplinary training faculty drawn from anesthesia, bioengineering, computational neuroscience, neurology, neurosurgery, physical medicine and rehabilitation, psychiatry, and radiology. The program will train postdoctoral clinician-scientists who have an understanding of and commitment to research in functional recovery and will devote themselves to studying the effects of novel interventions in patients. Postdoctoral neuroengineers trained by the program will be integrated into clinical research teams so that they can gain an understanding of the clinical environment required to lead multi- disciplinary teams developing new treatments for patients who survive brain injuries. Mentors and research experiences cover five overarching themes: 1) Clinical research and clinical trials, 2) Computational neuroscience, 3) From neural recording to neural imaging, 4) Neural repair, and 5) Neuromodulation. Trainees will spend a minimum of two years in the program. The program will combine a mentored research project within one of the five theme areas with specific coursework tailored to the theme area chosen by the trainee. All trainees will enroll in career development training activities specifically tailored to their background as clinician or neuroengineer. At its completion they will be prepared to submit successful research career development awards devoted to improving outcomes for survivors of acute brain injury. The program will capitalize on 1) strong clinical training programs in acute brain injuries at MGH, 2) strong research training programs in the clinical neurosciences, 3) strong bioengineering and computational neuroscience research training programs at Brown, and 4) the already close collaboration between MGH and Brown."
"9480604","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this grant is to continue providing high quality, interdisciplinary training in demography, with a focus on the relationships between population dynamics, socio-economic systems, and human health and welfare. Our objective is to recruit, train, and place high quality and diverse trainees across a range of disciplines. Many of the most important issues influencing child health and development in the contemporary world are demographic in nature. Examples include high rates of non-marital childbearing and marital disruption, especially in poor and minority communities; postponement of childbearing among highly educated women into the late 30s and beyond; and rising levels of income inequality, exacerbated by increasing residential segregation and marital sorting by education and income. Understanding and making progress on these kinds of problems requires a population perspective. Berkeley has long occupied a unique niche in the population studies training ecosystem, with a strong focus on the formal analysis of population systems, their dynamics, causes, and effects. We have sustained a strong record of training and placement, with recent trainees accepting tenure-track positions at Princeton, NYU, Michigan, Stanford, Toronto, and others. Since the last competing renewal, the University has made eight hires in population studies, including national leaders in the areas of research design, policy & health, American family dynamics, and inequality. These hires give further luster to an already extraordinary faculty. Our trainees will continue to (1) learn core demographic method and theory, with a focus on formal and aggregate approaches; (2) learn to think in critical and theoretically rich ways about how population processes and dynamics effect critical domains of human welfare, especially population health, family change, and inequality; (3) apply their knowledge of population processes and dynamics to substantive areas, particularly in economics, public policy, public health, and sociology. These aims are met through (1) core courses in demographic theory, demographic methods, research design, and statistical computing, (2) a broadened array of supplemental courses, including for example Fertility (Johnson- Hanks or Goldstein), Poverty and Inequality (Hoynes), Advanced Computational Methods (Wachter and Feehan), and Health Policy (Dow); (3) a weekly seminar in demography; (4) individual mentoring, especially through collaborative research projects. The proposed number of predoctoral trainees is 6, most of whom will receive 2 or 3 years of training grant support. This training grant complements our other NICHD- and NIH- funded initiatives, including the Berkeley Population Center, the Center for the Economics and Demography of Aging, the training grant in the Economics and Demography of Aging, the new Summer Workshop in Formal Demography, and the anticipated NIA-funded undergraduate diversity program Cal ADAR: Advancing Diversity in Aging Research at UC Berkeley."
"9585049","PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract) The classical Knudson?s two-hit model of tumor suppressor gene function envisions the sequential inactivation of both alleles as obligate steps in tumor formation and malignant progression. Epimutation (i.e. mitotically stable gene silencing associated with epigenetic alteration in DNA methylation) is proposed to act as one of the Knudson?s two hits for tumorigenesis. Remarkably, however, it remains unclear whether epimutation frequently observed in cancer cells plays a causal role in carcinogenesis. In human lung cancers, p16INK4A promoter hypermethylation is one of the earliest detected epimutations, and is thought to function as a critical initiating event in tumorigenesis. The importance of this epimutation is further underscored by the associations with distinct gene mutation patterns, cancer prognosis, and response to therapy. However, the molecular pathways linking aberrant DNA methylation, epigenetic silencing, and tumorigenesis remain poorly characterized. In this regard, we published the first mouse model demonstrating that targeted p16 epimutation drives spontaneous tumor development. The tumor spectrum of this epimutation includes sarcoma, lymphoma and lung adenocarcinoma. More importantly, our preliminary studies suggest that p16 epimutation operates synergistically with oncogenic K-RAS activation to drive lung tumor progression. Based on these findings, the overall goal of this proposal is to understand the role of p16 epimutation as a functional driver of lung preneoplasia. Specifically, we will: 1 ? Investigate the functional contribution of p16 epimutation in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. 2 ? Investigate the therapeutic effects of reversal of p16 epimutation using CRISPR-based epigenetic editing. These studies will elucidate how DNA methylation, an important mechanism regulating the expression of tumor suppressor genes, drives lung tumorigenesis. The results derived from this proposal could have a unique impact in the design of cancer epigenetic therapies."
"9477499","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing  techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research."
"9447395","PROJECT SUMMARY  The most frequent DNA lesion caused by oxidative stress is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxodG) and it is often associated with neurodegenerative diseases including PD and aging processes. In terminally differentiated cells like neurons, 8-oxodG DNA lesions in the transcribed strand of an active gene could be bypassed by RNA polymerase II, and generate erroneous proteins through a process called transcriptional mutagenesis. Studies have reported selective increase of 8-oxodG in the substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons of PD brain tissue. Decreased activity of the 8-oxodG-specific repair enzyme, 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (OGG1), was also documented in PD and aging conditions.  Coding region of human SNCA contains 43 potential sites for transcriptional mutagenesis. We recently found that oxidative stress or Ogg1 knockdown increase transcriptional mutagenesis of ?-SYN, leading to protein ag- gregation. Moreover using a novel technique, RNase H2-dependent PCR, we were able to identify various TM- generated ?-SYN mutants including S42Y and A53E from human PD brain samples. We have also found S42Y- positive Lewy bodies from postmortem brain samples of PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) using highly specific anti-S42Y antibody. Together, our preliminary results strongly suggest that transcriptional mutagenesis contributes to generation of novel pathogenic species of ?-SYN in 8-oxodG accumulation conditions such as Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathy.  Currently, there are major gaps in knowledge regarding the mechanism by which these mutant species may affect ?-SYN pathology and if ?-SYN aggregates in LBs contain mutant proteins produced by transcriptional mutagenesis. Our central hypothesis is that 8-oxodG-mediated transcriptional mutagenesis event leads to the generation of novel mutant variants of ?-SYN which causes nucleation-dependent aggregation and toxicity as seen in PD. The objective here is to identify oxidative stress-derived TM mutant species of ?-SYN and investigate their contribution to ?-SYN aggregation and the pathogenesis of PD.  The following three specific aims will be pursued: In Aim 1, levels of 8-oxodG and the entire profile of TM- derived mutant variants of ?-SYN mRNA in human postmortem brain samples of PD and control will be meas- ured. In Aim 2, the role of TM-generated ?-SYN mutants in nucleation-dependent aggregation process will be investigated and ?-SYN TM mutant proteins will be detected in human postmortem brain samples. In Aim 3, the collective effect of TM-generated mutants on ?-SYN aggregation, toxicity, and neuron-to-neuron transmission will be assessed.  Successful completion of the project will create a paradigm shift in our understanding of the molecular mech- anisms underlying oxidative stress-mediated ?-SYN pathology in PD. Knowledge of TM events in ?-SYN might be equally important to understand other molecules, such as A? and tau in other neurodegenerative conditions."
"9524064","Project Summary: There is a compelling need for prospective, properly controlled studies in women with epilepsy (WWE) during pregnancy to improve maternal and child outcomes. The proposed investigations are pertinent to the NINDS Epilepsy Research Benchmarks, address multiple gaps in our knowledge noted by the American Academy of Neurology, and transform care in WWE. This multicenter investigation employs a prospective, observational, parallel-group, cohort design with an established research team. The FDA requires animal testing of individual AEDs to detect risks of fetal exposure for anatomical teratogenesis (i.e., congenital malformation), but not for functional teratogenesis (i.e., cognitive and behavioral deficits). Further, multiple human AED pregnancy registries are investigating malformations, but not cognitive/behavioral outcomes. Determining the effects of fetal AED exposure on development of neuropsychological abilities requires prospective collection of potential confounding factors and testing of children years after exposure. Thus, it is not surprising that such studies are rare, and the risks for most AEDs have not been assessed. The MONEAD investigation provides a unique cohort of exposed and unexposed children who have been followed prospectively starting in early pregnancy with detailed data collection; MONEAD is the first study to assess the effects of quantitated AED-exposure on neurodevelopment during pregnancy and breastfeeding by directly assessing blood levels in mother, cord blood and infant. This is critical because several commonly used AEDs undergo marked clearance changes during pregnancy with marked individual variability in these changes. Such changes could obscure ?dose? relationships reducing sensitivity of detecting adverse effects. MONEAD is also collecting data on the effects of breastfeeding while taking AEDs which includes blood levels in the child and a breastfeeding diary to directly delineate their exposure. This has never been done previously. The collection of AED levels and other pregnancy related factors is complete. In the proposed continuation grant, the children will undergo detailed neuropsychological testing at 2, 3, 4.5, and 6 years-old. The results will provide clear indications of AED risks to the immature brain for the presently most commonly used AEDs, and provide sentinel data on less commonly used AEDs to direct future studies.  The Specific Aims are to determine the long-term effects of in utero and infant AED exposure in the children of WWE on: Aim 1: Cognitive outcomes (e.g., verbal abilities and other cognitive domains including novel measures of cerebral lateralization and creativity), Aim 2: Behavioral outcomes (e.g., adaptive and emotional/behavioral functioning, with measures of autistic behavior, attentional problems and hyperactivity), Aim 3: Determine if breastfeeding when taking AEDs adds additional risks. Hypotheses: Children exposed in utero to certain AEDs will exhibit concentration- dependent impairments in cognitive abilities and abnormal behavior. Continued AED exposure through breastfeeding will not add additional neurodevelopmental risk."
"9397043","Candidate: Dr. Felicia Skelton completed medical school at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), residency in rehabilitation medicine at the University of Washington, serving as chief resident, and clinical fellowship in spinal cord injury (SCI) medicine at BCM. She is a current health services R&D (HSR&D) post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness and Safety (IQuESt) at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC) in Houston, TX. She has four first-authored publications, one submitted manuscript and two pending manuscripts. She is dedicated to a career as a clinician scientist, and as a Black female, an ideal candidate for the Historically Black College or University (HBCU) Research Scientist Training Program. Career Development and Goals: During this award period Dr. Skelton will obtain the necessary epidemiologic, qualitative methods, database analysis and implementation science skills to become an independently-funded clinician scientist exploring optimal health care delivery and outcomes for Veterans with SCI. This will be achieved through completion of coursework leading to a masters in clinical investigation from BCM, as well as other targeted educational opportunities developed by her diverse group of mentors and advisors. Environment: IQuESt and MEDVAMC are the ideal settings to complete this research, as the premiere HSR center in the Southwest and the one of the largest SCI centers in the nation, serving over 450 Veterans in the outpatient setting annually, respectively. Dr. Skelton has the support of clinical, research, administrative and patient advocacy leadership both locally and nationally for this project. Research: Bacteriuria, ether asymptomatic (ASB) or symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in persons SCI. Current Veterans Health Administration (VHA) guidelines recommend a screening urine culture for every Veteran with SCI during their annual evaluation, even when symptomatic, which is contrary to other national guidelines. Our preliminary data suggest that a positive urine culture (even without signs or symptoms of infection) drives antibiotic use. As the clinical outcomes of the annual exam testing have not been explored, we theorize some Veterans are receiving antibiotics unnecessarily. The negative consequences of antibiotic overuse and antibiotic resistance are well documented, and have a national and even global focus. This study will develop an intervention aimed to educate stakeholders on evidence-based management of ASB and UTI, and guide antibiotic stewardship in this high-risk population. Aim 1 will identify patient, provider, and facility factors driving bacteriuria testing and subsequent antibiotic use after the SCI annual evaluation using qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys. Aim 2 will use national VHA databases to identify the predictors of urine testing and subsequent antibiotic use during the annual examination, and compare the clinical outcomes of those who received antibiotics to those who did not. Aim 3 will use the information gathered from the previous aims to develop the ?Test Smart, Treat Smart? intervention, a combination of patient and provider education and resources that will help all stakeholders have informed conversations about urine testing and antibiotic use; feasibility will be tested at a single site. The next step wil be to refine the intervention and test its feasibility and effectiveness at multiple sites, with VA merit review funding, as well as guiding policy reform surrounding this common, but burdensome condition."
"9566095","PROJECT SUMMARY  Aging has profound impacts on the development and progression of human diseases that are principal causes of mortality, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, infectious diseases and cancer. Aberrant epigenetic alterations have been attributed to the development of many age- related disorders and have recently been found to be closely linked to aging itself. The long-term goal of this project is to determine the roles of epigenetic and chromatin regulatory pathways in the regulation of aging.  Recently, through a novel histone mutant lifespan screen, we found that tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3) promotes longevity by suppressing intragenic cryptic transcription. We have also shown that cryptic transcription, considered a form of transcription infidelity, increases with age in both yeast and worms; genetic manipulations that suppress cryptic transcription extend lifespan. These observations suggest that the age-associated increases in cryptic transcription and the resulting loss of transcription fidelity are evolutionarily conserved causes of aging. In the proposed project, we will test this hypothesis by investigating 1) the cause of increased cryptic transcription during aging; 2) how suppression of cryptic transcription extends lifespan; and 3) the functional conservation of this pathway during aging in higher eukaryotic systems, including worms and mammalian adult stem cells. This project examines the molecular causes of aging from a novel perspective and will lead to the discovery of new epigenetic mechanism of aging that could serve as potential therapeutic targets of aging and age-related diseases."
"9521232","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia associated with an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, dementia, and mortality. Current treatments for AF, including antiarrhythmics, oral anticoagulants, and catheter ablation, have limited efficacy and carry significant risks, highlighting the need for prevention. Unfortunately, we currently lack effective interventions to prevent the onset of this common condition. Intervening on the cardiac substrate, characterized by atrial fibrosis and remodeling, to avert or reverse its development offers an attractive approach to AF prevention since this substrate is a key predisposing factor for AF onset. In our prior work in observational studies we have shown that increased body weight is a major risk factor for the development of AF. More recently, we also demonstrated in a randomized trial that individuals assigned to a Mediterranean diet enriched in extra-virgin olive oil had lower risk of AF than those assigned to a control diet. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the described associations are not completely understood, but changes in the atrial substrate are likely responsible. In this application, we propose to conduct an ancillary study to the recently-initiated PREDIMED-PLUS trial with the primary aim of assessing the effect of a weight-loss lifestyle intervention on the cardiac substrate of AF. The PREDIMED-PLUS study is a multi-center, randomized trial for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in 6,874 overweight and obese men and women with the metabolic syndrome in Spain. The trial will evaluate the effect of an intensive weight loss-focused lifestyle intervention program?including an energy-restricted Mediterranean diet, increased physical activity, and cognitive behavioral weight management?compared to a control intervention of low-intensity dietary advice on the Mediterranean diet. In the present application, we propose to conduct repeated assessments of the AF substrate performing repeated echocardiography and measurements of circulating biomarkers of pathways involved in the pathogenesis of the AF substrate (cardiac fibrosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, myocardial injury, atrial stretch) in 573 participants of the PREDIMED-PLUS trial with completed baseline echocardiographic exams. We will determine the effect of the intensive lifestyle intervention on cardiac structure and function, with a primary focus on the atria, and in biomarkers of AF-related pathways. Additionally, we will evaluate the association between the different components of the intervention (weight loss, compliance with the energy-restricted Mediterranean diet, increased physical activity) and changes in the atrial substrate. The proposed studies will determine the efficacy of an intensive lifestyle intervention on the pathophysiological substrate of AF and will inform the development of specific recommendations for the prevention of processes ending in the clinical onset of AF."
"9624948","Abstract Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is remarkably adept to establishing in an infected host a clinically silent latent state that can subsequently reactivates, posing a formidable hindrance to tuberculosis (TB) control. It is generally thought that the majority of the one-third of the world's population estimated to be infected with Mtb harbor latent bacilli. This latter population affords a large reservoir for the perpetuation of Mtb. The latent persistent form of Mtb is often drug-tolerant and thus difficult to treat. Given the propensity of Mtb to enter dormancy, it is likely that the infectious inoculum inhaled by a susceptible host contains latent form of bacilli in addition to those that are actively replicating. Ample evidence support the notion that Mtb, when exposed to conditions conducive to the establishment of a latent state, displays a gene expression profile distinct from that of actively replicating bacilli. Thus, it is likely that the antigenic profile of a latent persister is different than that of its rapidly growing counterpart. Indeed, loss of acid fastness has been demonstrated in Mtb existing in a chronic persistent state, which is thought to be, at least in part, the result of an aberrant cell envelope structure in dormant bacilli. Based on the above, it stands to reason that an effective TB vaccine should elicit an immune response that can target both actively replicating and latent persistent bacilli. In fact, BCG, the only anti-TB vaccine currently available and generated in conditions unrelated to those conducive to promote persistence (and therefore likely not expressing antigens (Ags) unique to latent tubercle bacilli), may not be capable of inducing an immune response that optimally protects against persistent organisms. The Jacobs group has recently characterized a set of mutants of Mtb kasB, which encodes a ?-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase involved in the biosynthetic pathway of mycolic acids (a major family of mycobacterial cell envelope lipids). The study has revealed that KasB activity is regulated via phosphorylation at two threonine residues, and that specific KasB-deficient mutants display phenotypes consistent with features of persisters, including a loss of acid fastness and inability to replicate when inoculated into mice. Importantly, immunization protocol that includes an acid-fast negative kasB persistent mutant -- which phosphorylation sites at the two aforementioned threonine residues have each been replaced by an asaparte (kasB-DD) -- protects against Mtb better than regimens that use BCG alone. The acid-fast negative kasB-DD strain displays an aberrant lipid profile involving species beyond mycolic acids. Aberrant packing of the cell envelope due to abnormal surface lipids such as mycolic acids may expose other macromolecules, including proteins and carbohydraes, that are otherwise masked. Collectively, these observations support the notion that persistent Mtb can express distinct Ags and that targeting such moieties, in addition to those typically present in actively replicating bacilli, might lead to enhanced vaccine efficacy. We therefore hypothesize that targeting Ags differentially expressed by and/or distinct to Mtb persisters represents an effective approach to developing anti- TB strategies including immunotherapeutics and vaccines. To begin testing this hypothesis, we propose to characterize the humoral immune response elicited by the acid-fast negative kasB-DD persister. The choice of this approach is based on emerging evidence suggesting antibodies (Abs) play a significant role in protection against Mtb and in modulating infection outcome. In addition, rigorous characterization of the Ab response to kasB-DD (and in the process, that of the control WT Mtb) can be expected to generate an extensive set of Mtb Ag-specific monoclonal Abs (mAbs) that constitutes a most valuable set of tools for advancing our understanding of three important aspects of Mtb research: (i) the humoral response of WT and persister tubercle bacilli, (ii) the biology of the difficult-to-track persistent Mtb, and (iii) the mechanisms that regulate tuberculous latency. Thus, the information yielded by these studies have the potential to lead to the development of novel strategies for better control of Mtb, including efficacious vaccines."
"9529341","This Project focuses on the range of male-female mortality differences. The World Health Organization announced in 2006 that, for humans, female life expectancy exceeded the male level in all the world's countries. It is sometimes thought that this was always the case and that the gap is roughly the same across countries. Furthermore, it is sometimes asserted that female life expectancies exceed male levels for almost all species. The truth is more complicated.  The research in this Project relies on lifetables that can be found in the literature and on websites or that we propose to estimate. The lifetables will be analyzed to document the range of male-female mortality differences across human populations over time and place. The Project will also document the range of male-female mortality differences in nonhuman vertebrates by analysing sex-specific mortality data for about 600 species of vertebrates (especially mammals and birds). It includes: (1) An analysis of about 3,000 pairs of sex-specific lifetables for human populations over the past 250 years. This will shed new light on the range of differences between male and female life expectancies as well as on male-female age-specific death rates and identify the populations with the biggest and smallest differences. Factors contributing to the gaps will be investigated. (2) Estimation of lifetables for human experience over the past 10,000 years based on skeletal data. With the new (re-assessed) data, we will test the hypothesis that from the Neolithic until the late Middle Ages male life expectancy was higher than female life expectancy. Together with the findings from our analyses of human lifetables, these findings will be of importance in providing a better understanding of the development of human male-female longevity differences. (3) A study of sex-specific lifetables and life-expectancies for some 600 vertebrate species. This will reveal the range of the relative life-expectancy gap across species of vertebrates, especially mammals and birds, and not only show how universal the purported female advantage is, but also shed new light on the species characteristics that determine the size of the gap. (4) The development and application of statistical software to estimate age-patterns of mortality from problematic datasets, including human skeletal data, data on human hunter-gatherers, and data for other species across the tree of life. (5) Analysis of data on causes of deaths for males vs. females in humans, in other mammals and in birds? in the wild and in zoos."
"9448648","SUMMARY This research proposal is in response to AHRQ (NOT-HS-16-009) and examines the quality and safety impacts of real-time patient-provider video and telephone visits, interactive health information technology (IT) tools with potential to engage patients through convenient health care access. Telemedicine can offer patients the choice to access a provider visit without the obstacles of securing transportation, arranging time-off from work or care-giving, or spending time in a waiting-room. Even as American patients are increasingly purchasing internet-based telemedicine visits from third party services without in-person facilities, gaps remain in the scientific evidence about patient adoption of telemedicine for primary care encounters (compared with in-person visits). This study will examine a 2016 health IT implementation offering patient - initiated primary care telemedicine encounters through the patient portal of an integrated healthcare delivery system. All patients scheduling an appointment with a primary care provider through the portal (website and mobile application) choose directly between a traditional in -person visit and a telemedicine visit, either by video or telephone. Over a five year study period (2016 -2020), we will examine a large sample of patient-scheduled telemedicine appointments, including over 50,000 video visits and 500,000 telephone visits, compared with millions of patient-scheduled in-person visits. Using patient surveys (N=1,500) and stakeholder key informant interviews, we will examine the experiences of telemedicine users and decision-makers, including technology usability, convenience, and patient-reported outcomes. In the study setting, this novel patient telemedicine access is fully integrate d with patients? own existing health care providers and comprehensive electronic health record (EHR). We will examine patient clinical concerns and access measures associated with the choice of a telemedicine encounter compared with in-person encounters (Aim 1), and the quality and safety of the telemedicine encounters through guideline-recommended health care processes (prescribing and ordering), follow-up visits, and events ( emergency department visits) (Aim 2). We will test the hypotheses that care processes and short-term event rates for patient-initiated telemedicine encounters will not be worse than for patient-initiated in-person visits (non-inferiority hypothesis), while accounting for patient engagement, recent changes in health status, case-mix, cost-sharing for in-person visits, internet access, and patient demographic and socio-economic characteristics. By examining an early adopter of the technologies, and a large and diverse patient population, this project has the potential to provide timely evidence to inform emerging telehealth policies, technology adoption decisions, and real world use by patients and clinicians."
"9463416","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Cases of DM are expected to rise by 72% through 2025, affecting 325 million people across all nations and income groups. It is increasingly recognized that there is phenotypic heterogeneity among individuals who develop DM. One subgroup that has attracted particular attention in recent years is the lean diabetes group, e.g. individuals with DM in the absence of obesity. Lean individuals with DM are at substantially higher risk of mortality and other complications than obese individuals with DM. However, little is known about the factors that promote DM in the absence of obesity, or the mechanisms underlying the worse outcomes in this subset. Asians are particularly susceptible to developing lean DM. Approximately half of Asians who develop DM are considered normal weight (BMI less than 25 kg/m2). This propensity is independent of country of residence, e.g. it affects Asians living in th U.S. as well as in Asian countries. Indeed, studies in the U.S. indicate very high rates of DM among Asian-Americans. The pathogenesis of DM reflects a complex interplay of genetic, dietary, and environmental exposures affecting multiple pathways. One approach to understanding the activity in many metabolic pathways at once is metabolomics profiling. Metabolomics refers to the systematic analysis of metabolites in a biological specimen, such as plasma. Combining biomarker and phenotypic data in human populations provides a rich opportunity to identify the biochemical signatures of metabolic diseases, which can enhance biological understanding as well as yield tools for disease screening. Metabolomics data from non-European cohorts, and particularly Asian cohorts, are sparse. The differences in the epidemiology of DM across racial/ethnic groups suggest the possibility of pathophysiological differences. Recently, in a preliminary study in the Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS), we found evidence that Chinese women had some risk markers for DM that were distinct from those described in European populations. Thus, we propose to expand considerably on our work in European populations and our pilot studies in the SWHS, by performing comprehensive metabolomics profiling in 2 Chinese cohorts to identify metabolites that are associated with incident DM. Our aims are (1) to identify metabolites that associate with incident DM in Chinese individuals enrolled in the SWHS and Shanghai Men's Health Study (SMHS); and (2) to replicate the association of metabolites with incident DM in a separate case-cohort study. We will also assess whether addition of metabolites improves the ability to predict risk of DM in Asians, compared with risk factors alone, and whether the metabolite predictors are associated with mortality and cardiovascular events. Our team is uniquely positioned to conduct these studies, given our expertise in applying metabolomics in large cohorts, our access to other metabolomics datasets for comparison and validation, and our experience with chronic disease epidemiology in China."
"9600315","Function and Stability of Expanded Regulatory T cells in Obese Renal Transplant Candidates ABSTRACT More than two-thirds of adults in the United States are currently considered obese. The epidemic is particularly acute in Kentucky (ranked fifth highest state in the US) as well as in Appalachian counties in adjacent states that make up the University of Kentucky Transplant Center?s service area. In 2016, this center evaluated nearly 1,000 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), of which 54.2% had a body mass index (BMI) equal or greater than 30 Kg/m2 (obese status). Obesity is an increasingly common comorbidity in patients with chronic renal diseases. In kidney transplant patients, it has been associated with delayed graft function, acute rejection episodes, and graft loss. Acute cellular rejection occurs through immunologic mechanisms that include the adaptive immune response mediated by T cells. A growing body of evidence recognizes the balance between graft-reactive effector cells and graft-protective suppressor regulatory T cells (Tregs) as the ultimate determinant of long-term allograft survival. Our Transplant Center is developing a novel clinical protocol using expanded autologous Treg infusions to induce tolerance in renal transplant recipients with the ultimate goal of enhancing long-term allograft function, preventing rejection, and reducing the overall toxicity of current immunosuppressive regimens. Circulating Treg cells are reduced in number and function in obese patients. Therefore, the generation of sufficient numbers of clinically competent suppressive Treg cells from these obese patients is especially challenging. In addition, how the obese microenvironment may alter the functional competency of adoptively transferred Treg is not known. In order to characterize the association between obesity-related parameters and the functional integrity of Tregs, this study will (1) optimize the conditions of primary Treg cell expansion isolated from obese potential transplant recipients, and (2) determine the tissue distribution, functional progress, and lineage stability of adoptive transferred Tregs in obese recipients. We hypothesize that the ex-vivo activation and expansion of obese Treg cells will overcome cell-intrinsic alterations and extrinsic pro-inflammatory signals associated with obesity. In Specific Aim 1, we will measure baseline levels of Treg cells in peripheral blood from obese (BMI ?35) and non-obese (BMI <25) ESRD patients. We will also purify the Treg cells, expand them ex-vivo and verify their cell phenotype, expansion rates, suppressor activity, metabolic profile, and linage stability. We will compare the data generated from obese and non-obese patients and perform a multivariable logistic regression analysis with the parameters collected to determine independent predictors of Treg cell expansion and function. In Specific Aim 2 we will use a mouse model to evaluate in vivo the functional proficiency of adoptively transferred Treg cells into obese recipients. The results will (1) characterize the population of Treg cells (baseline levels), (2) determine the feasibility of expanding functionally competent and stable Treg cells from obese patients, and (3) establish the in vivo influence of obese environment to the functional status of adoptively transferred Treg cells."
"9523300","Age-related decline in physical health is one of the most pressing concerns our country faces. In the context of this important societal challenge, one of the major contributions of health psychology has been to demonstrate that variation in physical health is reliably associated with aspects of the person (i.e., individual differences in personality traits) as well as the key social contexts in which the person is embedded (i.e., the quality and nature of adults? interpersonal experiences). For example, in predicting mortality, the effect size for the personality traits of conscientiousness and neuroticism are equal to, if not greater than low SES or low IQ1. Similarly, it has been noted that ?social relationships?constitute a major risk factor for health?rivaling the effect of well established health markers such as cigarette smoking, blood pressure, blood lipids, obesity and physical activity?2 (p. 1). In short, that key intra- and interpersonal resources are reliably associated with health status is now not in dispute. Nevertheless, the degree to which these associations emerge from environmentally mediated processes amenable to intervention remains largely unknown because existing research cannot rule out the possibility that some of these associations might reflect the impact of confounds, including especially evocative genetic processes, that produce correlations between personality/interpersonal experiences and physical health3, 4. We propose to use an innovative co-twin control design to rule out potential genetic and family background confounds and thereby identify environmentally mediated connections linking both personality and interpersonal experiences in advancing age with physical health outcomes. To sidestep problems with correlated measurement error, we will use a multiple-levels-of-analysis approach to assessment, including: (a) self- and romantic partner-reports of personality, social support, and relationship satisfaction, (b) observations of marital interactions while participants? autonomic nervous system responses are monitored continuously, and (c) measurement of health-related behaviors and both standard and early biological markers of health status. Moreover, we intend to do all of this in the context of a genetically informed research design. Though this has never before been done, it is critical in properly targeting interventions to improve health among older adults. More specifically, we will study whether the relation between individual/interpersonal differences and physical health is environmentally mediated by working with participants in the Minnesota Twin Registry (MTR) now in late life (800 twin pairs with their romantic partners, as applicable), a group that completed an assessment of personality previously (~28 years ago, when they were ~38 years old). The acquisition of these new measures from the MTR will allow us to address our specific aims: (Aim 1) to determine whether associations between both personality and relationship experiences in late life and physical health are environmentally mediated, (Aim 2) to identify mechanisms in the environmental pathways connecting personality and health, and (Aim 3) to test whether the effects of personality and relationship qualities extend to biological indicators of health risk."
"9520965","Hearing loss (HL) is a highly variable phenotype that affects more than 70 million children worldwide. Among syndromic HL is Usher syndrome (USH), a neurosensory disorder defined by a bilateral sensorineural HL and a loss of vision due to retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Usher syndrome is classified into three clinical subtypes. A molecular diagnosis study suggested a frequency of 1/6000 individuals afflicted with USH in the US. Fourteen distinct genetic loci have been linked to the USH phenotype and genes for eleven of these loci have been identified. Genetic and functional studies of the gene/protein determinants of USH have been fruitful in elucidating the common molecular components of inner ear and retinal sensory epithelia. However, the molecular identities of many essential components of these two sensory organs are still unknown, precluding our understanding of molecular and cellular basis and precise mechanism of hearing and vision in general. Likewise, the known loci/gene mutations do not account for all known cases of USH. The long-­term goal of this research is to fully understand the mechanisms of inherited Usher syndrome and to develop therapeutic agents for the treatment and prevention of USH. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and characterize proteins essential to mammalian inner ear development, function and long-­term maintenance of retinal sensory cells. Our hypothesis is that if a mutated gene causes deafness and blindness, then the normal function of that gene will be necessary for hearing and vision. The rationale for the proposed research is that identifying a causative gene and understanding its normal function is essential for preventing hearing and vision loss and for the development of therapeutic agents to treat these impairments. The project addresses NIH?s mission to develop basic knowledge that may be translatable to reduce the burdens of human disability. In our preliminary data we have already identified two mutant genes: USH1K and USH1M, and have mapped the chromosomal positions (USH1H and USH1N) of two additional genes essential for auditory and visual function. The proposed experimental design comprises of two aims that include the ascertainment and clinically phenotype members of extended families segregating USH;? identification of new USH genes, characterization of their expression in the mouse inner ear and retina and determine the effect of identified variant of novel USH gene on the encoded protein in model systems. The project will advantageously combine human clinical assessment and genetic analyses with relevant to inner ear and retina development and function. It will be significant by advancing concerted methods and yielding basic new knowledge that is clinically relevant, with high potential to improve the molecular epidemiology, genetic diagnosis and counseling for USH.       "
"9593267","Project Summary Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Increasing evidence indicates that the inhibition of remyelination is a major cause of the permanent neurodegeneration. However the precise mechanism that inhibits OPCs differentiation and remyelination remains an active area of research. While inflammation-associated NOTCH1 activation was implicated in defective remyelination in MS, the precise mechanism by which NOTCH1 was engaged during inflammatory response remains elusive. Using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, we and others have established that IL-17 signaling is crucial for the induction of inflammation in the CNS. We have now discovered a direct integration of IL-17 and NOTCH1 signaling that plays a dominant role in impairing the differentiation of OPCs. IL-17 stimulation induced the release of the intracellular domain of NOTCH1 (NICD1) in the OPCs co-cultured with astrocytes. Mechanistically, IL-17R interacts with NOTCH1 via the extracellular domain, which facilitates the cleavage of NICD1. Subsequently, Act1, the adaptor protein for IL-17 signaling, forms a complex with NICD1, followed by translocation of Act1-NICD1 complex into the nucleus. Act1-NICD1 complex promotes the assembly of RBP-J containing transcriptional complex on the promoters of NOTCH1 target genes implicated in CNS inflammation. Furthermore, a decoy peptide disrupting the IL-17RA?NOTCH1 interaction inhibited IL-17-induced NICD cleavage, reduced IL-17-induced OPC prolifereation and attenuated the myelin loss in EAE model. Based on these findings, we hypothesize IL-17-NOTCH1 pathway drives the expression of a specific set of genes to promote inflammation and inhibition of OPC differentiation, thereby impairing the remyelination process in the demyelinating disease. We will test this hypothesis through Aim 1: Investigate the molecular mechanism of the inhibitory role of IL-17-NOTCH1 integration on OPC differentiation. Aim 2: Investigate the in vivo impact of IL-17-NOTCH1 integration on remyelination process. The completion of this proposal will provide fundamental insight into the critical integration of signaling pathways of IL-17 and NOTCH1, which underlies the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease, offering novel therapeutic strategies for MS patients by promoting remyelination."
"9485779","PROJECT SUMMARY. The UW School of Social Work, in partnership with Heritage University?s School of Social Work in Yakima Valley recently partnered to develop a training program for BA level Social Workers to address limited clinician capacity in rural primary care settings. Currently the curriculum is a combination of didactic training in telephone based CBT (20 hours), role play training (25 hours), and guided supervision. This model of training is like the methods used by EBPI training programs for care managers in the AIMS Center and the VA. The scalability of these programs is limited, however, by expert time to conduct training activities, clinician time away from work to engage in training activities, and the fact that even when clinicians participate in training, there is no guarantee they will certify. Adaptive learning, an educational method that uses adaptive algorithms to may be a potential solution to these problems in capacity building. These programs can tailor the educational experience to the needs of the trainee, reduce time in training, improve competence in complex decision-making and standardize training. This study builds on the existing research base on EBPI training, and adds to it by designing and testing an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) based on adaptive learning algorithms. Both EBPI experts (Aisenberg) and past EBPI trainees (Heritage University School of Social Work) will partner with experts in educational software development (Popovic) to create the ITS, which will be compared to training as usual on time to training, competence and skill drift. We hypothesize that capacity building through improved EBPI learnability (target mechanism) will result in enhanced clinical ability to deliver EBPI elements competently, and in a shorter time-period, and that greater competence will result in better quality of care."
"9592348","PROJECT SUMMARY The primary objective of this proposal is to couple a) mechanistic insight relating differentiation outcomes to ECM engagement via intracellular signaling events triggered at the focal adhesion (FA), with b) 3D printing of ECM and ECM-associated proteins as a means to direct cell distribution with maturation and thereby enable fabrication of thick, functional cardiac tissue. The proposal is significant as it has the potential to generate replacement tissues and even heart grafts for individuals suffering from acute and chronic injury to the heart. It is the first of its kind to address the conundrum of the apparent uniformity of the focal adhesion relative to the myriad of different ECM/integrin combinations and the corresponding variety of cell behaviors that emerge from ECM engagement. It does so by proposing that elements of the FA, namely integrin linked kinase (ILK) and associated phosphatase, act as sensitive rheostats that can be co-opted to yield desired behavior. Here, the desired behavior is cardiac differentiation, and the innovation is the utilization of optimized ECM formulations as bioinks to create 3D cardiac tissue mimics (3DCTM) capable of directing cell distribution of multiple cell types with differentiation. This concept is feasible as the Ogle laboratory has long-studied the biochemistry of the ECM and stem cell behaviors associated with ECM engagement, and the McAlpine laboratory has focused on 3D printing of functional materials for a range of applications, from biological to electronic and the merger of these materials. These groups will also interface with expertise of the Kamp lab with respect to their recent generation of induced cardiac progenitor cells (iCPCs) to populate the 3DCTM, the Provenzano lab to assist with molecular mechanisms associated with FA formation, the Garry lab to assist with bioreactor implementation, the Zhang lab to add cardiovascular physiology expertise, and the Talkachova lab to assist with optical imaging to assess function of the 3DCTM and core facilities for mass spectrometry of ECM components and gene editing tools for modulating ILK activity. Together, this expertise will be funneled toward meeting the primary objective of the proposal via the following aims: 1) determine whether activation of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) of focal adhesions or costameres couples integrin activation to ?-catenin activation via GSK3? to enable expression of genes associated with cardiomyocyte specification, 2) use 3D ECM-based model systems to identify ECM formulations supportive of endothelial differentiation and assess ILK dependence, and 3) use ECM-based 3D printing to modulate differentiation of cardiac cell types spatially in a cardiac tissue mimic. The motivation for this concept was based on extensive literature search, and results from our own experimentation; the approach was designed to insure that the interpretations of the results are subject to minimal bias and the hypotheses posed are truly tested."
"9522619","PROJECT SUMMARY To better investigate, identify and sense (detect) viruses, high-resolution separation, isolation and concentration is of significant importance. Our team is developing a bioparticle separation scheme based on dielectrophoresis using a microfluidic device that promises, and has demonstrated, extremely high-resolution separations of bioparticles. The separation is based on specific biophysical makeup of the viruses that in turn result in electrodynamic properties that vary for each specific target. If a separation scheme is of high enough resolution, distinct populations of homogeneous particles can be purified. Our preliminary data and recent theoretical modeling suggest that strain- or serotype-specific resolution of virus particles is achievable, however, this has not been explicitly shown. Unlabeled viruses must ultimately be used for the platform to be integrated in various virus assessment workflows. To enable detection of the separation of unlabeled virions, on-chip detection capabilities are developed, addressing this limiting issue in the current level of development. To demonstrate and develop the microfluidic platform we will use gene altered Sindbis virus (Venus and mCherry) which are fluorescent. Once parameters have been established for optimal dielectrophoresis in our system, the wild-type Sindbis virus (SINV) will be compared with mutants that harbor changes in the E2 protein to establish the ability to separate the viruses. Standard molecular biology genotyping and phenotyping will be used to confirm separation of virion populations. Figures of merit (detection limit, dynamic range, sensitivity and specificity) will be determined for the separated viruses along with defining appropriate properties of the incoming sample (ionic strength, pH, additives, etc.) to ensure proper operation of the technique."
"9475180","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The six-protein shelterin complex cooperates with telomerase to maintain the integrity of chromosomal ends. As part of shelterin, the protein ACD/TPP1 protects telomeric ends from the DNA damage response machinery. Additionally, ACD/TPP1 is uniquely involved in recruiting telomerase to telomeres through a dedicated protein surface known as the TEL patch. Both end-protection and end-elongation are important for the maintenance and function of somatic stem cells in aging tissues. We showed that ACD/TPP1 has essential context- specific functions in hematopoietic stem cells and in other tissues. Recent work identified candidate ACD/TPP1 mutations in patients with Dyskeratosis congenita, a human disorder characterized by impaired somatic stem cell function in the bone marrow and other organs, with features of premature aging. This is the first identification of ACD/TPP1 mutations in human disease. Our preliminary data show that these mutations can disrupt telomerase recruitment and telomere homeostasis in cell lines. However, how telomere maintenance defects in cells due to ACD/TPP1 mutations translate to dysfunction of specific stem cell compartments in vivo and how they contribute to tissue aging and disease is not understood. We hypothesize that ACD/TPP1 mutations can play a causative role in Dyskeratosis congenita and related somatic stem cell disorders. Furthermore, we postulate that point mutations affecting the interface of ACD/TPP1 with its protein partners can reveal unique functions of the shelterin complex when modeled in mammalian tissues. To explore this hypothesis in detail, we will study candidate mutations and other variants affecting binding of ACD/TPP1 with telomerase or with its shelterin partner TIN2, using modern genome-editing technology to assess their in vivo effects in the entire organism. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Evaluate the impact of candidate human ACD/TPP1 TEL patch mutations on hematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow homeostasis; 2) Determine the structural requirements for the interaction of ACD/TPP1 with TIN2 and the functional consequences of defective TIN2- ACD/TPP1 binding; 3) Investigate how tissue homeostasis and longevity are affected by candidate ACD/TPP1 pathogenic variants that disrupt interaction with key protein partners. Our multidisciplinary approach will identify distinct functional surfaces of ACD/TPP1 and determine their impact on stem cells, tissue homeostasis and aging. We anticipate that we will uncover how mutational dysregulation of ACD/TPP1 and the shelterin/telomerase complex can ultimately result in human disease."
"9281578","Project Summary/Abstract  The Phase III multimodal data acquisition (MDA) core provides: 1) state-of-the-art neuroimaging protocols for stable and reliable imaging; 2) training of principal investigators (PIs) and their support staff on general and practical aspects of acquiring neuroimaging data (e.g., physics of imaging, how to avoid and correct for motion artifacts); and 3) new technological development to answer questions that will lead to new core capabilities and help future users of the MDA core. Specifically, the MDA core will support neuroimaging protocols based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). These protocols include high resolution structural MRI (sMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI) to map fiber connectivity, functional MRI (fMRI) to characterize changes in blood oxygenation as a consequence of neuronal activation, MEG/EEG to directly monitor neuronal activation with high temporal resolution, and MR spectroscopy (MRS) to measure brain metabolic profiles. The emphasis is on multimodal imaging so each Project PI will acquire imaging data from some combination of the above including concurrent EEG-fMRI or MEG-EEG. Training of PIs and support personnel consists primarily of lectures embedded within weekly meetings and a formal monthly seminar series managed by the administrative, clinical assessment, and mentoring (ADM) core. New MRI protocols will be developed during Phase III that take full advantage of the 32-channel radio-frequency (RF) coil now available at MRN. New developments include: 1) examining white matter integrity (myelin maps and structural connectiv- ity); 2) attaining higher temporal resolution in concurrent EEG-fMRI experiments for studying dynamic changes in functional connectivity; 3) developing optimal methods for removal of physiological noise; and 4) optimizing three-dimensional GABA measurement methods to enable reliable measurements over smaller voxels. This core is led by Dr. Julia Stephen (MRN) with over 20 years of experience in MEG/EEG methods, along with MR phys- icists Drs. Arvind Caprihan (MRN) and Stefan Posse (UNM Neurology) who each have 20+ years of experience with MR-based methods. Drs. Larry Wald (MGH) and Matthew Brookes (Univ. Nottingham) are consultants on this core. 2"
