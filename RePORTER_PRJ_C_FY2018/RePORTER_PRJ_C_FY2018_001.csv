Accordingly, three specific aims are proposed to investigate the three major afferent pathways which normally connect onto lumbar MNs to determine their roles in NT-3-mediated remodeling of lumbar motor circuitry and hindlimb recovery after a thoracic SCI above the lumbar level, namely above-level SCI; and these pathways include the following: the reticulospinal tracts (RetST), the descending propriospinal tracts (dPST), and the dorsal roots afferents (DR). Once the functional role of each specific pathway is defined, we will used combinational approaches to target multiple pathways to maximize the treatment effect.

In the case of breast cancer, As exposure promotes cellular phenotypes that are more aggressive as well as more lethal in cell culture but it remains unknown whether it would promote more lethal breast cancer phenotypes in human subjects. Our laboratory found that As activates cancer stem cell reprogramming via a mechanism that involves increased mitochondrial ROS and HIF2? activation. Hence, it is proposed that As drives the subtype/phenotypic specification of breast tumor cells promoting chemoresistance, recurrence and metastatic disease in women with breast cancer independently of its potential roles as a direct carcinogen of the breast. The finding of a potential biomarker signature will also enable unprecedented studies of the potential effects on breast cancer in women who have been exposed to arsenic (drinking water).",9830818; ,"BONINI, MARCELO G;","REINLIB, LESLIE J",9/30/2017,9/29/2018,Acetylation; Antioxidants; Area; Arsenic; base; Biochemical; Breast; Breast Cancer Cell; Breast Cancer cell line; cancer initiation; cancer stem cell; cancer subtypes; Carcinogens; catalase; Cell Count; Cell Culture Techniques; Cells; chemotherapy; Chicago; Chronic; Development; Diffuse; Disease; drinking water; Effectiveness; Enzymes; epidemiology study; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Estrogen receptor negative; exposed human population; Exposure to; gain of function; Genetic; genetic manipulation; Histologic; Human; human subject; Hypoxia; improved; In Situ; Laboratories; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder; Malignant Neoplasms; malignant phenotype; Mammary Neoplasms; Mediating; men; Mitochondria; mitochondrial metabolism; Molecular; Molecular Profiling; monomer; mouse model; Mus; mutant; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; Oncoproteins; personalized care; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenocopy; Phenotype; Physiological; potential biomarker; Prevalence; Production; Reactive Oxygen Species; Recurrence; Renal carcinoma; Resistance; response; Risk; Risk Factors; Rodent; Role; Sampling; Signal Transduction; Sirtuins; Skin Cancer; SOD2 gene; stem; Stem cells; stem-like cell; stemness; Therapeutic; therapy resistant; Tissues; Treatment Failure; tumor; tumor initiation; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Universities; Water; Woman; Xenograft Model; Xenograft procedure; ,Environmental Arsenic Exposures and Breast Cancer Subtype Specification,28149,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,1,115697,69303,185000,

The relevance to public health would be to use the results from this study to serve as experimental basis to aid in development of new therapies for effective prevention or treating retinal edema, a major cause of profound vision loss, as well as drug delivery across blood retinal barrier.",9858937; ,"CHEN, JING ;","SHEN, GRACE L",9/30/2017,4/30/2022,Affect; angiogenesis; beta catenin; Binding; Biological Assay; Blindness; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Blood capillaries; Blood Vessels; Blood-Retinal Barrier; capillary; Carrier Proteins; Caveolae; caveolin 1; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Nucleus; Cells; Clathrin; Complement; Data; design; Development; Drug Delivery Systems; drug development; Electron Microscope; Endocytosis; Endothelial Cells; Exhibits; Exocytosis; Exudate; Eye; Eye diseases; Familial disease; Family; Fluorescence; Fundus; Gene Targeting; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Human; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; interstitial; Lasers; LDL-Receptor Related Protein 1; Lead; Ligands; Link; lipoprotein receptor related protein 5; loss of function; Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor; Luciferases; macula; Measures; Mediating; Membrane Transport Proteins; Methods; microscopic imaging; Microscopy; Molecular; Molecular Weight; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; Neuraxis; Norrie's disease; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; Nuclear; Osmotic Pressure; overexpression; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Prevention; Public Health; public health relevance; receptor; Regulation; Reporter; Retina; retina blood vessel structure; Retinal; retinal angiogenesis; Retinal Edemas; Role; TCF Transcription Factor; Testing; Tight Junctions; Transcriptional Regulation; transcytosis; Transportation; Vascular Diseases; Vascular Endothelium; Vascular Permeabilities; Vesicle; WNT Signaling Pathway; Work; ,Wnt signaling-mediated control of blood-retinal barrier,28100,DPVS,Diseases and Pathophysiology of the Visual System Study Section ,,,1,250000,192500,442500,

Intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation is a major risk factor for glaucoma and glaucoma therapy currently is based on lowering IOP. However these therapies are not very effective. IOP elevation results from poor drainage of aqueous humor (AQH) from the anterior chamber through the Schlemm's canal. Then molecular mechanisms controlling drainage through the Schlemm's canal are undefined. We were among the first to show that the Schlemm's canal is a lymphatic like vessel. Our proposal aims to determine the role of lymphatic molecules in regulating the molecular mechanisms controlling AQH outflow and IOP elevation. These studies will provide new information regarding the mechanistic basis of AQH outflow which in the long run will be useful in producing better therapies for lowering IOP and preserving vision in patients. ,12388211; ,"KIZHATIL, KRISH ;","LIBERMAN, ELLEN S",9/30/2017,8/31/2022,Adult; Affect; Anatomy; anterior chamber; Antibodies; Aqueous Humor; aqueous humor flow; base; Biological; Biology; Blindness; Blood; Blood Vessels; Candidate Disease Gene; Cell Wall; Cells; Confocal Microscopy; Data; Defect; Development; Devices; differential expression; Dimensions; Disease; Drainage procedure; effective therapy; Endothelium; experimental study; Eye; fluid flow; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic; genome-wide; Glaucoma; Goals; Heterozygote; high resolution imaging; Human; Imagery; improved; innovation; Knock-out; Knowledge; Lymphatic; Lymphoid Tissue; Maintenance; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Morphology; Mouse Strains; Mus; new therapeutic target; novel; novel strategies; Ocular Hypertension; Pathway interactions; Patients; Perfusion; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Physiologic Intraocular Pressure; Physiological; Physiology; Positioning Attribute; Process; Proteins; Proteomics; Public Health; Regulation; Reporter; Resistance; Resolution; response; Risk Factors; Role; Route; Signal Pathway; Structure of sinus venosus of sclera; Study models; System; Tamoxifen; Techniques; Testing; therapeutic target; Time; tool; Tracer; transcription factor; transcriptome sequencing; Treatment Efficacy; Vision; ,Determining How Lymphatic Molecules Control Conventional Outflow,28175,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,1,250000,187500,437500,

With compelling preliminary data that Tead1 regulates ?- cell proliferation in mice, we propose to identify molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ?-cell proliferation by Tead1. We will also determine the role of Tead1 in human ?-cell proliferation to translate the findings from mouse studies to diabetes therapy in humans.

The prevalence of HFpEF is expected to increase over time, due to the population ageing and other factors. Morbidity and mortality for HFpEF patients remains high; rates are comparable to those observed in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Poor outcomes in HFpEF are related to a lack of evidence-based therapeutic options. There is an urgent need to efficiently conduct large, simple, streamlined trials with clinically-relevant endpoints comprised of therapeutic interventions for HFpEF patients. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) present one promising treatment for HFpEF. In clinical trials of HFrEF patients, MRAs have consistently demonstrated their ability to improve symptoms, and reduce mortality and hospitalizations. However, The Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial was the largest study of MRAs in HFpEF. In TOPCAT, spironolactone did not significantly reduce the primary outcome (a composite of cardiovascular death, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF) relative to placebo, but did reduce a secondary endpoint of HF hospitalization (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69?0.99, p=0.04). A post-hoc regional analysis of TOPCAT, limited to North and South America, found that spironolactone reduced the primary endpoint (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69?0.98) compared to placebo. These promising results require additional investigation prior to widespread implementation. Additionally, there are concerns whether efficacy results of MRAs from traditional randomized controlled trials can be effective in real-world community practice. Registry Randomized Clinical Trials (RRCT), pioneered by the Uppsala Clinical Research Center and the Duke Clinical Research Institute, leverage existing registries to more efficiently identify study patients and collect follow-up endpoints. Additionally, RRCTs generally enroll real-life patient populations, therefore being more generalizable. Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF) is a pragmatic RRCT that will enroll patients from Sweden and the United States to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of open-label spironolactone versus usual care in community practice. The primary hypothesis is that treatment with spironolactone will reduce the primary endpoint (i.e., cardiovascular mortality) compared with usual care. Resolving whether spironolactone is beneficial in HFpEF patients would have tremendous public health implications.",1866626; ,"PETERSON, ERIC DAVID;","DESVIGNE-NICKENS, PATRICE ",9/15/2017,7/31/2022,Address; Adult; Aging; aging population; Aldosterone Antagonists; American; base; Cardiac; Cardiovascular system; Cessation of life; Clinical; Clinical Data; Clinical effectiveness; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; clinically relevant; Community of Practice; Community Practice; Confidence Intervals; Country; Data; Data Coordinating Center; Drug Costs; Effectiveness; EFRAC; Enrollment; Event; evidence base; follow-up; Future; Generic Drugs; Guidelines; hazard; Heart Arrest; Heart failure; Hospitalization; Intervention Trial; Investigation; Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction; Life; Mineralocorticoid Receptor; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; North America; open label; Outcome; patient population; Patients; Placebos; Population; Prevalence; primary outcome; Public Health; Randomized; Randomized Clinical Trials; Randomized Controlled Trials; Registries; Research Institute; Russia; South America; Spironolactone; Sweden; symptomatic improvement; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; treatment as usual; United States; ,SPIRRIT-HFPEF - CCC,134679,CLTR,Clinical Trials Review Committee ,,,1,1363963,233744,1597707,

The Compliant FINE (C-FINE) we will deploy offers distinct advantages over earlier nerve cuff designs, including a shape that matches the native nerve morphology, a contoured stiffness profile for flexibility along the nerve's length, and simple layered construction suitable for microfabrication for higher density contact arrays.  The new nerve cuff stimulation module we will develop will enable implantation of multiple 8-contact C-FINEs to further improve the quality and functionality of lower extremity neuroprostheses.  C-FINEs implanted on the femoral nerves will isolate knee extension and hip flexion to achieve standing and stepping, and devices on the tibial and fibular nerves above the knee will generate strong and balanced ankle plantar/dorsiflexion for improved forward propulsion and improved foot-floor clearance from a surgically accessible and protected location that avoids repeated bending with joint motion to further enhance walking performance.  Because weak stimulated hip extension limits the clinical utility of all existing lower extremity neuroprostheses, we will also evaluate the possibility of selectively activating individual hamstring muscles with a high density electrode array on the sciatic nerve.

Case-control studies have implicated eating at restaurants as a source of non-outbreak-associated infections with several disease agents (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E. coli O157:H7). These studies, along with the substantial burden of foodborne illness outbreaks associated with commercial food establishments, were primary reasons for the formation of the Environmental Health Specialist Network (EHS-Net).

According to our limited knowledge, this transmembrane lipid movement is critical for blood clotting and also is an important step during cell death. Nevertheless, the misconceptions about the phospholipid transport have prevented us from further understanding of its importance in human health and disease. In this project, I propose a new cell signaling paradigm to explain the cellular functions of the understudied transmembrane phospholipid transport phenomenon. Using multidisciplinary approaches to manipulate the newly discovered TMEM16F lipid transporter, I will test this new paradigm, characterize its physiological and pathological functions in the brain and discover new reagents to target lipid transport.

Adhesion proteins are essential for the organization of all multicellular organisms, and for numerous biological processes critical to life. Their functions are linked not only to their binding affinities (bond energies), but also to their organization within adhesion zones. However, it is a major challenge to study adhesion proteins in their native context because they function at buried interfaces, which are experimentally difficult to access.  The broad goal of this research program is to develop a multiscale computational and experimental framework that quantitatively predicts both molecular scale protein dynamics and ensemble-average receptor binding kinetics at intermembrane contacts. Our approach will integrate empirically derived molecular parameters in a computational algorithm that will quantitatively simulate protein behavior in 2D environments of increasing complexity. These studies use cadherins as model adhesion proteins, because both theory and experiment suggest that 2D confinement alters the assembly of cadherin adhesions in ways that affect tissue physiology. In Aim 1 we will develop a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to quantitatively predict single molecule tracking measurements of cadherin diffusion, binding rates and clustering on planar lipid bilayers. Under Aim 2, single molecule tracking measurements and simulations will test the hypothesis that 2D protein confinement within adhesion zones alters molecular-scale protein binding rates and diffusivities relative to proteins on unconfined membranes. In Aim 3 we extend the simulations to connect molecular scale dynamics (in Aims 1 and 2) to macroscale measurements of ensemble-average intermembrane (cell) binding kinetics. If successful, our approach and findings will have broad significance for studies of proteins within adhesive contacts that have, until now, been experimentally and computationally challenging to study.",8066710; ,"LECKBAND, DEBORAH E;","WEHRLE, JANNA P.",9/30/2017,7/31/2021,Address; Adhesions; Adhesives; Affect; Affinity; base; Behavior; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biological Process; Cadherins; Cell membrane; Cell model; Cell physiology; Cells; Complex; Computational algorithm; density; Diffuse; Diffusion; Environment; experimental study; Goals; Individual; Investigation; Kinetics; Lateral; Life; Link; Lipid Bilayers; Measurement; Mediating; Membrane; Modeling; Molecular; molecular scale; Monte Carlo Method; mutant; Organism; Physiology; programs; Protein Dynamics; Protein Fragment; protein function; Proteins; receptor binding; Research; simulation; single molecule; Testing; theories; Tissues; two-dimensional; unilamellar vesicle; Vesicle; ,Multiscale investigation of the impact of 2D confinement on adhesion protein function,117104,MSFD,Macromolecular Structure and Function D Study Section ,,A1,1,240552,79339,319891,

HALEY VA MEDICAL CENTER,FL,336124745,"PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:      Secondary neuronal injury in stroke results in massive neuronal death days to weeks after the primary insult. Few treatment options are available to alleviate effects of the free radical-induce damage to brain. One recently discovered possibility is treatment by antioxidant enzymes or their artificial mimetics, which can serve as highly efficient free radical scavengers at the site f injury. However, these agents alone are unable to reach the site of injury because brain is separated from the blood stream by the blood-brain barrier. The goal of this project is to improve delivery of highly reactive antioxidant AEOL 10150 to central nervous system. If successful, this research can lead to considerable improvement of stroke outcomes and therefore enhance long-term quality of life for the stroke survivors. Here, we propose to test this approach using a mouse stroke model. Once established, the proposed approach can be further extended to improve outcomes of other neurological conditions that involve secondary injury, such as traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury.",1867302; ,"KINDY, MARK S.;",,10/1/2014,9/30/2018,Achievement; Address; Adverse effects; Animal Experiments; Animal Model; Animals; Antibodies; antioxidant enzyme; Antioxidants; Attention; base; Behavior assessment; Binding; Biodistribution; Blood; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain; Brain Injuries; brain parenchyma; brain tissue; Carotid Arteries; CASP3 gene; catalase; Cause of Death; Cell Culture Techniques; central nervous system injury; Cerebral Ischemia; cerebral ischemic injury; Clinical; Continuous Infusion; cytotoxicity; Data; Development; disability; Disease; dosage; Dose; Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome; drug candidate; Drug Carriers; Drug Delivery Systems; drug distribution; drug efficacy; Drug Evaluation; Drug Modelings; efficacy evaluation; Electrophysiology (science); Ensure; Enzymes; experimental study; Fc Receptor; FDA approved; Free Radical Scavengers; Free Radicals; Generations; Glycolic-Lactic Acid Polyester; Goals; Human; immunogenicity; improved; improved outcome; In Vitro; in vitro testing; in vivo; Infarction; Injury; intravenous administration; Ischemia; Ischemic Stroke; Lead; Ligands; Lipids; Liposomes; Measures; Mediating; Microspheres; Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion; mimetics; Modeling; Molecular Weight; Mus; N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors; nanoparticle; nanoparticulate; nanoscale; Neuraxis; Neurologic; Neurologic Deficit; neuron loss; Neuronal Injury; Neurons; novel therapeutics; NR1 gene; Outcome; Outcome Measure; oxidation; Oxygen; Patients; Peroxides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Phase I Clinical Trials; preclinical study; prevent; Price; Process; Production; Prophylactic treatment; public health relevance; Quality of life; Rattus; Reactive Oxygen Species; receptor; Reducing Agents; Reperfusion Therapy; Reporting; Research; Rodent Model; Safety; safety study; Secondary to; Series; Serious Adverse Event; Site; spinal cord and brain injury; Stream; stroke; stroke survivor; stroke treatment; Superoxide Dismutase; Superoxides; System; targeted delivery; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; Therapeutic Effect; Therapeutic Uses; Time; Toxic effect; Translations; Traumatic Brain Injury; United States; vector; Vitamin E; Water; ,Targeted Delivery of Antioxidant Drugs Following Cerebral Ischemic Injury,1450,RRD1,Brain Injury: TBI & Stroke  ,,,5,,,,

However, unlike computers, whose operation can be understood using wiring diagrams and logical flowcharts, no similar circuit-level framework for the brain is available. What elementary circuit computations are performed by neurons? How much information does the wiring diagram contain? What other information is necessary to describe behavior? What physiological and genetic methods can provide such information? Traditionally, these questions are addressed in specific organisms and systems. Yet, it is likely that the answers are similar across various organisms. Therefore, researchers working on different organisms must benefit by interacting with each other and exchanging their results. To provide a venue for such interaction and exchange, we propose to hold a meeting entitled Neuronal Circuits at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in April 2018.

Our system is based on the observation that A ? peptides (toxic molecules generated in AD) are in a dynamic equilibrium between the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). Amytrap is composed of a retro-inverse (RI) peptide linked to polyethylene glycol and albumin which can sequester toxic amyloid peptides A ? -40 and A-42 in the periphery. Addition of albumin appears to enhance the sequestering effect of the RI peptide. We have reproducibly shown that this formulation, which is injected subcutaneously as a gel, is effective in clearing A from brai and is non-toxic and non- immunogenic in a mouse model of AD. The proposed phase 2 research attempts to perform genetic toxicology and safety pharmacology studies on Amytrap. The proposed research is aimed to meet the regulatory requirements for an investigative new drug filing (IND). We have put together a strong team of researchers and continued our efforts in establishing partnership with commercial entities to ensure guaranteed progress on commercialization initiatives.

To date, rehabilitation for UE hemiparesis post-stroke has produced highly variable outcomes revealing minimal genuine change in motor impairment or functional use of the affected UE.

This proposal addresses fundamental questions of how the minimal genetic region in PWS is required for diurnal metabolism and neuronal maturation using molecular and genomic approaches in mouse models as well as human brain tissues. Results from these investigations are expected to provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of PWS and may enable improved therapy for PWS by timed rapamycin treatments, phototherapy, and/or noncoding RNA based therapies.

Toward this effort, we have generated transgenic mice carrying ALS-FTD UBQLN2 mutations that mimic the human disease, which provide us unique tools to investigate the underlying mechanisms that cause disease. Examination of the models strongly indicates perturbation of ER stress is associated with disease.

In order to determine whether Fish Oil has antidepressant properties, or enhances conventional antidepressants, we will explore a possible cellular mechanism whereby both fish oil and marketed antidepressant compounds exert their effect. We will investigate the actions of two omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid components of fish oil in a unique, cell based biomarker system we have developed. This will be done alone and in combination with one class of antidepressants, in order to determine whether, as our preliminary results indicate, fish oil enhances antidepressant efficacy. We will also attempt to translate this biomarker into one indicative of treatment response by examining peripheral tissue from an NIMH-funded clinical study on the antidepressant effects of poly unsaturated fatty acids. Finally, we will test these effects on cells derived from depressed patients with known response (or lack of response) to antidepressants. Results from these investigations will provide important information about a cellular mechanism that may be responsible for the purported efficacy of omega- 3 fatty acids in the treatment of major depressive disorder. They will also help us to establish a simple blood biomarker that can objectively identify both depression and antidepressant response (whether to alternative/complimentary or to allopathic treatment).",1860545; ,"RASENICK, MARK M.;","DUFFY, LINDA C.",9/30/2015,9/29/2019,"Acylation; Adenylate Cyclase; Aftercare; Alpha Cell; Animal Model; antidepressant effect; Antidepressive Agents; Autopsy; base; Biochemical; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Biological Models; biosignature; Blood; Blood Cells; Blood Platelets; Blood Tests; Cell Line; Cell membrane; Cells; cellular imaging; Chemosensitization; Chimeric Proteins; Cholesterol; Chronic; Citalopram; Clinical; clinical efficacy; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; cost; Cultured Cells; Data; Depressed mood; depressed patient; design; Detergents; Development; Dietary Supplementation; Disease; Dose; Drug Exposure; Effectiveness; Enrollment; Environment; Erythrocytes; Etiology; Evaluation; experimental study; Exposure to; Fish Oils; Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching; Foundations; Fractionation; Funding; G-substrate; Goals; GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs; GTP-Binding Proteins; Human; imaging study; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; individual patient; innovation; Investigation; Ketamine; Liquid substance; Location; lymphoblast; Major Depressive Disorder; Measures; Mediating; Membrane; Membrane Lipids; Membrane Microdomains; Mental Depression; Modification; Monitor; N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid; National Institute of Mental Health; Neuroglia; novel; Omega-3 Fatty Acids; Peripheral; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Placebos; Population; pre-clinical; preclinical study; predictive modeling; Property; prospective; public health relevance; Recording of previous events; Reporting; response; Risk; Sampling; screening; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor; Severities; Signaling Protein; Speed; Suggestion; Supplementation; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; time use; Tissues; Translating; Treatment Efficacy; treatment response; Unsaturated Fatty Acids; Work; ",Mechanism of Action for n-3 PUFA antidepressant properties,9169,APDA,Adult Psychopathology and Disorders of Aging Study Section ,,,3,263133,139802,402935,

Obesity, a growing problem for Americans and Veterans alike, is the greatest risk factor for the development of OSA. Male gender and smoking, other OSA risk factors, are common in Veterans. Given the high comorbidity of these risk factors in Veterans, OSA presents a significant health burden to Veterans. Our prior work provides evidence that OSA occurs in up to 69% of Vietnam-era Veterans with PTSD. OSA is easily treated; however, 15-30% of OSA patients are non- compliant with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the standard OSA treatment.

Its onset and severity is influenced by exposure to air pollution, especially to very small particles (particulate matter or PM, such as found in soot) that released in the exhaust of vehicular traffic. We have found that PM make asthma worse by activating an molecular pathway involving a protein known as Jagged 1 hat interacts with proteins of the Notch family cellular receptors. Jagged 1-Notch interaction may make asthma worse by shutting down the function of immune cells known as regulatory T (Treg cells) that normally inhibit immune cell activation and inflammation. We also found that PM interacts with human gene variant, IL4RAR576, common in asthmatics to induce worse inflammation. In this proposal we will employ genetic mouse models to examine how PM act via the Jagged Notch pathway to inhibit Treg cells and promote asthma. We will also examine how exposure to PM affects disease severity of human subjects with asthma especially if they carry the IL4RAR576 genetic variant.

Drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, are known to cause stable changes in neuronal function throughout the reward pathway and lead to drug-seeking and drug-taking, even following long periods of abstinence; a defining feature of substance use disorder is the propensity to relapse following these periods of withdrawal and abstinence. It is estimated that up to 40-60% of individuals suffering from substance use disorder will suffer relapse. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying these changes to circuit function, and, ultimately, behavior, is critical to developing new treatment targets and strategies. The F99 phase of this proposal will examine the epigenetic regulation of a novel neural-circuit in regulating reinstatement of cocaine-associated behavior, a behavioral-model for relapse, and has the potential to identify a novel therapeutic target. Completion of the F99 phase will provide training, both professional and technical, in preparation for and transition to the postdoctoral, K00, phase of this proposal.

At present, there are no known molecular or pathogenic factors that can predict poor clinical outcomes in adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. Data from a recent clinical trial in epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC, trial for NV-422) has shown that a significant portion of subjects suffered sustained visual loss for several weeks after presentation. Preliminary molecular data from this trial revealed unexpected diversity of adenoviral species and types, and high genomic variability even within the same type. Additionally, approximately 20% of patients had no evidence of adenoviral infectioin by PCR, which was validated by next generation whole genome sequencing (WGS). We propose to examine the host and viral factors predictive of poor visual or anatomic outcomes in viral keratoconjunctivitis. The available dataset for this trial constitutes over 100,000 discrete data elements, and the molecular dataset includes over 5,000 clinical swab samples. In our first aim, we propose a comprehensive analysis for host and viral factors predictive of outcomes in the disease.

The prevalence of HFpEF is expected to increase over time, due to the population ageing and other factors. Morbidity and mortality for HFpEF patients remains high; rates are comparable to those observed in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Poor outcomes in HFpEF are related to a lack of evidence-based therapeutic options. There is an urgent need to efficiently conduct large, simple, streamlined trials with clinically-relevant endpoints comprised of therapeutic interventions for HFpEF patients. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) present one promising treatment for HFpEF. In clinical trials of HFrEF patients, MRAs have consistently demonstrated their ability to improve symptoms, and reduce mortality and hospitalizations. However, The Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial was the largest study of MRAs in HFpEF. In TOPCAT, spironolactone did not significantly reduce the primary outcome (a composite of cardiovascular death, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF) relative to placebo, but did reduce a secondary endpoint of HF hospitalization (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69?0.99, p=0.04). A post-hoc regional analysis of TOPCAT, limited to North and South America, found that spironolactone reduced the primary endpoint (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69?0.98) compared to placebo. These promising results require additional investigation prior to widespread implementation. Additionally, there are concerns whether efficacy results of MRAs from traditional randomized controlled trials can be effective in real-world community practice. Registry Randomized Clinical Trials (RRCT), pioneered by the Uppsala Clinical Research Center and the Duke Clinical Research Institute, leverage existing registries to more efficiently identify study patients and collect follow-up endpoints. Additionally, RRCTs generally enroll real-life patient populations, therefore being more generalizable. Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF) is a pragmatic RRCT that will enroll patients from Sweden and the United States to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of open-label spironolactone versus usual care in community practice. The primary hypothesis is that treatment with spironolactone will reduce the primary endpoint (i.e., cardiovascular mortality) compared with usual care.

Many Veterans that receive traumatic brain injuries show suffer from chronic deficits in behavior and cognition, and typically these are treated at VA hospitals. As such, developing new methods of treating these deficits is absolutely at the core of the VA's mission. Recently, there is much interest in developing novel methods of 'neuro-engineering' circuits to treat neurologic disorders. Such neuro-engineering approaches offer a potentially powerful and novel way of enhancing plasticity in a targeted manner. To develop such treatments, we first need a pre-clinical model with clear and well-understood circuit dysfunctions.

Hair cells are known for their extraordinary structure where they usually have a flask-shaped or a cylindrical cell body that lacks both dendrites and axons. Perhaps the major distinguishing feature of the hair cells is the presence of actin-based staircase-like hair bundle that insert into an actin-rich meshwork known as the cuticular plate. Deviation in this precise morphology, as small as it can be, leads to hearing loss and balance disorders. In this research plan I propose to use standard genetic and molecular biology techniques along with physiological experiments to understand the role of an actin-bundeling protein that is specifically localizes to the cuticular plate in the development and maintenance of these mechanosensory receptors.

In the past decade research has started to address the emotion paradox of aging: why do older adults report more positive emotion and appear to be effective emotion regulators despite showing cognitive decline? Nearly all studies addressing this issue have been motivated by models focusing only on differentiating classes of regulatory strategies that can be implemented, which means that we know very little about two critical processes that precede implementation: 1) the initial identification of one's emotions and 2) how one decides to regulate using particular strategies. Using a combination of functional imaging and novel behavioral methods, this proposal aims to build and broaden our knowledge base concerning potential age-related differences in these two heretofore unappreciated aspects of emotion regulation.

One study even found that Veterans were more open to participating in couples/family therapy than in individual psychotherapy. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) created a new policy that encourages mental health care providers to involve Veterans' families in their mental health care, indicating the VA's commitment to family services. While research on Veterans' families is a rapidly growing field, no studies to date have compared the partnerships of female-Veteran couples to those of male-Veteran couples. Yet such comparisons may be essential, as research in the general population suggests that processes within partnership impact women's and men's mental health in different ways. Identifying gender differences in how Veterans' partnerships affect their mental health can inform more effective care, as providers can capitalize on gender differences to inform their assessment and treatment of male- and female-Veteran couples.

Narrative / Relevance:  An overarching, central question in all of neuroscience is the specificity, modification, and function of the immense diversity of function-specific circuitry? a question still inaccessible in multiple core aspects; this is what underlies how the brain-nervous system senses, integrates, moves the body, thinks, functions with precision, malfunctions with specificity in disease, degenerates with circuit specificity, might be regenerated, and/or might be modeled in culture. What actually implements and maintains circuit specificity is a key, core issue from developmental specificity of circuits, to developmental abnormalities and disease, to proper function (or dysfunction) and circuit type-specific molecular regulators and drugs, to subtype-specific degeneration (e.g. in ALS, Huntington's, Parkinson's diseases), to regeneration (or typical lack thereof) in the CNS for spinal cord injury or with optimal accuracy in peripheral nerves, to mechanistic and therapeutic modeling of disease using iPS/ES-derived neurons; growth cones (GCs) are the subcellular structures that ?build? circuits with specificity and mature into synapses, where human genomic risk associations are showing up in neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, developmental intellectual disabilities, but we know little about the diversity and specialization of circuit-specific GCs. I propose entirely new, highly innovative, pioneering work to deeply investigate subtype-, stage-, and target-specific GCs in development, cell biology, disease, and regeneration (also relevant to modeling) to uniquely address this critical gap in knowledge; we developed new approaches to investigate subtype- and stage-specific GCs directly from the brain, with high-depth, quantitative protein and RNA analysis, and have already completed proof-of-concept experiments identifying that hundreds of special proteins and RNAs are specifically enriched up to hundreds-fold in GCs, indicating that investigation of GCs might actually be required to understand subtype-specific circuitry, and enabling a range of pioneering new work.",6725967; ,"MACKLIS, JEFFREY D;","RIDDLE, ROBERT D.",9/30/2017,7/31/2022,Address; Anatomy; Autistic Disorder; base; Biochemistry; Bipolar Disorder; Brain; Caliber; Cell Nucleus; Cells; Cellular biology; Development; Disease; Disease model; experimental study; Functional disorder; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Genomics; Growth Cones; Human; Huntington Disease; induced pluripotent stem cell; innovation; Intellectual functioning disability; Investigation; Knowledge; Label; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Modeling; Modification; Molecular; Molecular Machines; Natural regeneration; neuronal cell body; Neurons; neuropsychiatric disorder; Neurosciences; next generation sequencing; novel strategies; Parents; Parkinson Disease; particle; Pathway interactions; Peptides; Peripheral Nerves; Pharmaceutical Preparations; presynaptic; Protein Analysis; Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics; Risk; RNA; RNA analysis; Schizophrenia; Sorting - Cell Movement; Specificity; Spinal cord injury; Subcellular structure; Synapses; Therapeutic; Transcript; Transcriptional Regulation; Work; ,"Subcellular RNA-Proteome Mapping in Subtype- and Circuit-Specific Growth Cones: Development, Cell Biology, Disease, and Regeneration",106665,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,1,700000,483000,1183000,

Smaller, flexible electrodes reduce the foreign body response; yet there are currently no technologies to insert and reposition these electrodes without stiffeners that increase the size of the electrode and produce acute damage.

Increase in systemic blood pressure (BP), secondary to administration of an anti-hypotensive agent (midodrine), has been shown to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) at rest and in response to cognitive testing, which was associated with improved test performance in hypotensive controls. In a relatively small group of hypotensive individuals with SCI we have demonstrated that midodrine significantly increases BP and CBF, which may improve cognitive function.

Overall, half a million Americans live with bladder cancer, with a cost per patient from diagnosis to death of ~$150K, the greatest of any cancer in Medicare. Furthermore, the death rate from this disease has remained relatively unchanged for 30 years. To identify new and functionally relevant pathways that can be therapeutically targeted in bladder cancer, we used a new genomic shRNA screen and identified Amylo- Alpha-1, 6-Glucosidase, 4-Alpha-Glucanotransferase (AGL), an enzyme involved in conversion of glycogen to glucose, as a new bladder tumor growth suppressor. This was the first description of a role for this gene in human cancer.

INFRASTRUCTURE AND ADMINISTRATION (Index of acronyms in Appendices Table of Contents)  A. Mission, Goals and Priorities. Minnesota is a prime arena for addressing social inequities in health.  Rapidly changing demographic composition has contributed new strengths as well as challenges to our health,  education, and social service systems. MN leads in East African, Latino and SE Asian immigration;  Minneapolis has the second largest urban American Indian population in the US. Our communities of color are  relatively young in terms of percentage of families with children, and particularly in Minneapolis and St. Paul,  health disparities are intermingled with economic distress and social segregation. The stark reality confronting  our communities and our systems of care is the deepening need for partnerships that meld community  experience with scholarship and public health (PH) practice-based knowledge. We believe, in the words of the  Lancet International Advisory Group on Adolescent Health, that '...failure to invest in the second decade of  life, despite the availability of proven and promising prevention and health promotion strategies, will  jeopardize earlier investments in health, substantially erode the quality and length of human life, and escalate  human suffering, inequity, and social instability.'1   The University of Minnesota Healthy Youth Development Prevention Research Center (UMN PRC) is  dedicated to nurturing partnerships that will co-create the fusion of knowing and doing through its core  mission: through collaboration with health departments, related agencies & community partnerships, develop  and disseminate actionable knowledge and practices that promote healthy development & health equity  among all young people, and, in so doing, advance adolescent-focused Healthy People 2020 (HP 2020) goals,  elements of the National Prevention Strategy, and CDC Winnable Battles, particularly reproductive health.   B. Organizational Structure and Linkages. Initially funded by the CDC in 1996 as the National Teen  Pregnancy Prevention Research Center, UMN PRC is embedded in an institutional context highly conducive to  achieving its core mission, goals and objectives, and leveraging complementary resources that expands its  reach and impact. As in Org Charts (App D), UMN PRC is part of an Academic Health Center (AHC) that  includes the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, and the UMN's CTSA. UMN PRC faculty/staff are  appointed in these AHC schools along with the College of Education & Human Development. The AHC is  under the direct authority of the UMN President, whose community engagement activities are conducted  under the auspices of the Office of Public Engagement to which UMN PRC members play an ongoing advisory  role. Likewise, the UMN CTSA partners with the PRC to strengthen its own inter-collegiate community  engagement portfolio of applied public health research, training, outreach and advocacy.   UMN PRC is located within the Division of General Pediatrics & Adolescent Health (DOGPAH), with its 35- year history and expertise in adolescent health research and translation, training, TA, community partnerships,  strategic communications, and dissemination of evidence to promote effective programs, policy and public  health practice. At its inception, UMN PRC capitalized on this experience through immediate formation of a  Community Advisory Network, and involvement of community partners, health departments and related  agencies in the crafting of our earliest core research focused on preventing teen pregnancy and sexual risk  behaviors (Prime Time). This early research evolved into school and clinic-based interventions that engaged  community members, educators and PH professionals in youth-development strategies to prevent teen  pregnancy, violence involvement, and school dropout. Our earliest intra- and inter-collegiate linkages with the  Konopka Institute for Best Practices in Adolescent Health (and its State Adolescent Health Resource Center  that provides TA and consultation to the nation's network of State Adolescent Health Coordinators), the  Center for Adolescent Nursing (with its extensive history of adolescent health research and preparation of the  scholarly and practice workforce), and the School of Public Health, nurtured the early development of an  interdisciplinary faculty and staff, linked across academic units, with a shared commitment to prevention  science, community engagement, applied research and its translation into action.   C. Staffing Plan. UMN PRC 2014-2019 will be guided by a Leadership Team comprised of Director Resnick,  Deputy Director Sieving, and Team Leaders: Oliphant (Community), Shea (Communications), Jordan  (Training), Shlafer (Evaluation) and McMorris (Research). The UMN PRC Org Chart (App D) depicts the  Leadership Team that will provide overall direction to the PRC, the interdisciplinary teams for each unit, their  key activities, and reporting lines within the broader context of the Division. We developed this organizational  structure in our initial funding cycle, honed and refined over time, recognizing that a Leadership Team that  includes CAN co-chairs (nominated & elected as per CAN by-laws) is essential to a PRC that is nimble and  responsive to priorities and concerns from health departments and other community partners. The UMN PRC  led the March 2008 PRC national network pre-conference ?Structured for Success? that explicated the PRC  network?s experiences with varying infrastructure arrangements. With the goal of enhancing each PRC's  capacity to increase its own effectiveness through infrastructure modification and improvements, this marked  the 1st time in the history of the network that PRC directors/representatives shared with each other the various  infrastructure arrangements crosscutting the national network.  D. Leveraged Resources and Institutional Commitments. Since its inception, UMN PRC has garnered  approximately $21,000,000 in research and training grants, PRC Special Interest Projects, foundation grants,    contracts and external sales. Documented in Letters of Support and shown in the UMN Org Relationships  Chart, the UMN institutional commitment in this competitive renewal application equals approximately  $365,000, i.e., annual match dollars for each of 5 years of the project period from the Office of the Vice President  for Research ($10,000), the AHC ($20,000), Department of Pediatrics ($20,000), CTSA (15% Training Team  Leader Jordan salary and fringe support, ~$23,000), and the Division of General Pediatrics & Adolescent  Health (office space, administrative, financial and technological support).   E. Qualifications and History of PRC Director. On faculty since 1981, Michael Resnick, PhD, Professor of  Pediatrics, Nursing, and Public Health, holds the Konopka Chair in Adolescent Health & Development. He is  the founding PD/PI (1996) of the UMN PRC. With colleagues, his work has had a transformative impact on  shaping the field of adolescent health in the US and globally. Beginning in the 1980s, under his leadership of  the National Adolescent Health Resource Center (funded by MCHB/HRSA/DHHS), the MN Adolescent  Health Survey and the subsequent American Indian Adolescent Health Survey (the largest survey of American  Indian and Alaskan Native youth ever undertaken at the time) formed the basis for the CDC in creating the  National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). Resnick served as a consultant to the CDC as the YRBS was  being developed, which today, is implemented in nearly every state across the country. His federal  congressional testimony on the findings of the Indian Adolescent Health Survey helped propel Congress to  authorize more than $30 million for adolescent mental health for young people on reservations, a 1st in the  history of the Indian Health Service. Resnick was also invited under two presidential administrations to be a  keynote speaker at White House conferences on youth. It is this interweaving of research and the translation of  research to improve the health and well-being of young people that has characterized his career. It is also  because of his growing reputation that in the mid 1990s he was invited to be a Co-PI on the National  Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) where, leading the MN team he had lead responsibility  for crafting the initial adolescent health survey component of that study. That landmark research was released  in 1997 with Resnick as lead author in JAMA. 2 This seminal article has been cited more than nearly any other  publication in the field of adolescent health and led to widespread prominence of the theme that has  epitomized his research: the influence of connectedness on adolescent health and well-being.   Resnick's work has had a profound impact on the field of adolescent health, ranging from our own federal  Office of Adolescent Health to the work of transnational institutions such as the World Health Organization,  the Pan American Health Organization, UNICEF, and more recently, the Lancet International Advisory Group  on Adolescent Health, where we see adoption of the healthy youth development paradigm that flows directly  from Resnick's work. In this area of research and research translation, no measures are more frequently used,  than those developed by Resnick with his interdisciplinary team at UMN. The use of this research on how to  best advance health equity in young people, assuring their ability to enter into rapidly changing social contexts  and a very complex global economy, embodies what Resnick has long defined as a goal of his career: to use  science, translation, dissemination and evidence-based advocacy to assure that we regard adolescents as whole human  beings in the context of family, peers, school and community, not as a simple set of risk indicators. It is his ability to  translate that research that has resulted in global impact. He has been invited to speak at policy and research  forums in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Portugal, Britain, Malaysia, Iceland, Germany, Switzerland, and  Turkey. And because of his international reputation he has attracted fellows and trainees from not only across  the United States but from Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Ghana, China, Barbados, Argentina, Uruguay,  Israel, and Canada, seeking to learn how to conduct research into healthy youth development and to translate  that work to set public health priorities and policies that benefit youth.   Resnick has been PI or Co-I on numerous federal and foundation research grants focusing on health and  risk behaviors, resiliency and protective factors in the lives of young people, with emphasis on issues related to  adolescent sexual behaviors, teen pregnancy, violence and school drop-out. He has been PI on $17.7 million in  external grants (NIH, CDC, MCHB, foundations) and co- PI/co-author on an additional $8.7 million in external  grants (counting awards of >$100,000). He has 177 peer reviewed journal articles, book chapters, reviews, and  monographs, many reflecting his active mentoring of newer faculty, fellows, and staff. He has served as a  consultant/reviewer for WHO, NSF, CDC, NIH, the Society for Adolescent Health & Medicine, the Guttmacher  Institute, the Natl Campaign to Prevent Teen & Unplanned Pregnancy, and several international research  councils. He has received 4 outstanding teaching and research awards. His PRC commitment will be 25%,  supported by a combination of PRC funds and resources from his Endowed Chair and match dollars.   F. Multidisciplinary Faculty and Staff with Demonstrated Experience. The UMN Org Chart shows the  academic appointments and inter-linkages of faculty and staff across the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, and  Public Health, and within our Division (DOGPAH) that create the group comprising UMN PRC. A particular  strength of this team is its intercollegiate, interdisciplinary composition, years of continuity in terms of  working relationships, and extensive experience in partnering with state, county and local health departments,  related agencies, and an array of community partners that share a commitment to nurturing healthy  adolescent development and the promotion of health equity among all young people. A table in Facilities &    Resources lists the PRC members, their areas of expertise and those who hold 1o and 2o appointments in AHC  schools and elsewhere at UMN. Our embeddedness in collaborative networks further flows from a long series  of core, community-partnered PRC projects that link scholarship, practice and dissemination of evidence with  our broader constituents and partners, foremost among them - state and local health departments, schools and  youth-serving agencies. As noted in a table in Facilities & Resources, PRC members are partnered with  national, regional, state and local collaborating organizations in a variety of capacities: research, TA, training,  evaluation, program and policy development, enactment, and diffusion. These relationships provide the basis  for our proposed scope of work, designed to address adolescent-focused national health goals, elements of the  National Prevention Strategy, and the CDC's Winnable Battles.  G. Ongoing-prevention Projects & Activities. UMN PRC members are engaged in a wide array of  prevention/health promotion activities supported by a diverse portfolio of funding that reflects our  interdisciplinary composition and well-established partnerships. These research, training and dissemination  activities will underpin much of UMN PRC's plan for activities over the next 5 years, involving state, county  and local departments of health, related agencies, community organizations and scholarly partners that share a  commitment to healthy youth development, the dual strategy of reducing risk while enhancing protective  factors and capacity in the lives of young people, and enhancing health equity that promotes positive life  trajectories for youth, particular those living in challenging social environments.

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, PARTNERSHIPS, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  A. Collaboration with Community Health Departments and Other Stakeholders. UMN PRC has an  extensive history of collaborating with and providing technical assistance (TA) to local, county and state  departments of health. As shown in the Work Plan, these ties will continue as we engage in work that connects  with community and increases the capacity of the PH workforce, i.e., we will capitalize on these relationships  as evidenced through Letters of Support.   Community Advisory Network: Headed by Team Leader Oliphant, UMN PRC will utilize the expertise of  our Community Advisory Network (CAN). Members of CAN are professionals who have broad expertise in  community-based health issues with young people and are employed by PH departments, departments of  education, and community-based non-profits. Half of the current members work in city, county and state  public health departments thereby strengthening the CAN-UMN PRC connection to public health. CAN  advises on various aspects of UMN PRC, including the core research project, community engagement efforts,  PH policies, training priorities, and dissemination strategies. Also, CAN provides invaluable guidance on  accessing youth-serving professionals, such as nurse practitioners and physicians, teachers, and other public  health professionals and will continue to advise on best means for reaching target populations and ensuring  greater reach and impact of Center activities. Past examples of CAN involvement include advising on  dissemination of the state's policy plan for teen pregnancy prevention, development of topics for training in  the Summer Institute, and advising on the core research projects such as assessing the need of out-of-school  youth. Letters of Support detail activities, roles and responsibilities, and partnerships goals for 2014-19.     Led by 2 co-chairs (elected by the whole body of the CAN to serve 2-year terms), the entire CAN meets  quarterly with additional ad hoc meetings as needed; co-chairs also participate in monthly Leadership Team  meetings. Co-chairs and all CAN members fulfill duties as outlined by the UMN PRC's CAN job descriptions,  rules/policies, and community engagement agreement, all created and approved by CAN (App D). A bi- monthly electronic newsletter assures communication with CAN, the Youth Advisory Board (described  below), and local, state and national partners. UMN PRC co-chairs have always actively engaged in the  National Community Committee (NCC), serving as chairs or members of the Oral Health Special Interest  Group, Policies & Procedures, and Fund Development. Oliphant and at least one co-chair have regularly  attended all NCC activities and participate in NCC monthly telephone calls. Oliphant has the trust of CAN  and extensive connections to community members, including UMN PRC's target populations. A founding  member of the now highly organized NCC, Oliphant has led UMN PRC's CAN since its inception.   Youth Advisory Board. UMN PRC will build on its existing Division's Youth Advisory Board (YAB). YAB  currently consists of 8 adolescents and young adults (ages 14-21 yrs) who have been trained on adolescent  health issues, including teaching interviewing skills to health providers. YAB will be expanded to include 3  youth who have been participating as peer educators in our current PRC core Latino teen pregnancy  prevention research project. YAB members are paid on an hourly basis with PRC match funding. Guided by  Oliphant, YAB will follow a Youth-on-Boards training model for its monthly meetings designed to advise on  various UMN PRC activities.  One YAB member elected by YAB will participate in CAN and PRC Leadership  Team meetings. In addition, YAB members will be engaged in community activities, providing TA to health  departments for the development of programming as well as providing training and feedback around  interviewing skills to medical and oral health professionals. Thus, YAB members will serve as technical  experts and teachers to practitioners who need training in best practices for interviewing adolescents on  specific topics related to the HP 2020 goals identified in the Community Engagement Work Plan.   B. Community Support and Engagement. UMN PRC will collaborate and provide TA to several departments  of health and education in its proposed scope of work, to commence in Fall 2014, including:   1. Oral Health and HPV-An Adolescent Health Initiative: The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH)  and UMN PRC will collaborate to develop a best-practice approach for MN dentists and oral health providers  to increase the awareness of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and the link to oropharyngeal cancer (OPC).   MDH's Oral Health Program and UMN PRC will develop a module for interviewing skills for dental health  providers that focuses on HPV, HPV vaccine and adolescent-friendly services, especially in school settings.  This work is an extension of the MDH Oral Health State Plan and the PRC's NCC Oral Health Work Group  with approaches based on CDC's recommendations for approaching high-risk groups for HPV-associated  OPCs and current trends in the incidence of HPV-positive OPCs. YAB members will provide direction on  module development and teach the module to oral healthcare providers. Sparked by conversations with the  Natl Oral Health Alliance, NCC, and MDH, this novel approach of using adolescents to teach oral health  providers is the 1st of its kind. Key stakeholders include the MN Oral Health Program and MDH Center for  Health Promotion. Under the director's leadership, we will have access to the statewide network of dental  providers and entry into annual conferences of oral health providers to teach the new module.   2. Adolescent Health Clinics Standards of Care and MN's DASH HIV Grant: Hennepin County (which  includes Minneapolis) Human Services and Public Health Department efforts to standardize clinical care for  adolescents are a systems-level innovation critical for improved adolescent sexual health outcomes. The  standards align with federal-level initiatives in the Office of Adolescent Health, CDC's Divs. of Reproductive  Health and Adolescent & School Health (DASH) that emphasize the use of standards-based approaches. We  will partner with Hennepin County, MDH and MDE staff funded by CDC DASH and the Natl Network of  State Adolescent Health Coordinators with the State Adolescent Health Resource Center (SAHRC) to  expanded adoption of clinical standards. This partnership will target new Hennepin County clinics, statewide  clinics in school districts targeted through the DASH grant, and nationally, clinics in other states, via the  training of State Adolescent Health Coordinators involved in sexual health programs. The partnership will  leverage diffusion of innovation strategies to accomplish this goal: segmenting audiences based on adoption  and thought-leader status, identifying and promoting the relative advantages of adoption, and addressing  compatibility, complexity and trial-ability. These will be promoted via 1) applied communications strategies  and products (UMN PRC and Hennepin County will co-create a tool kit); 2) experiential training facilitated by  the YAB that will offer clinics real-world experience effectively engaging adolescents; and 3) through inter- personal interactions and relationships, likely accomplished through the formation of a national Collaborative  Innovation Network that will allow partners to directly support one another. We regularly partner with  SAHRC to support state PH department collaborations to improve systems approaches to adolescent health.   3. MN Chlamydia Partnership (MCP): MDH identified chlamydia as a leading cause of morbidity in MN.  Seeking an innovative strategy for its prevention and control, the STD Clinical Specialist Infertility Prevention  Project Coordinator (MDH STD and HIV Section) and key stakeholder has requested the UMN PRC to provide  TA on future MCP activities. Specifically, through monthly planning meetings and in-the-field TA, we will     collaborate on models of care and dissemination of best practices for chlamydia control.  These approaches are  grounded in the MN State Plan for Chlamydia Prevention developed in a current partnership between MDH and  UMN PRC. We will work collaboratively both locally and in greater Minnesota to provide county and local  public health as well as community-based health non-profits on non-traditional approaches to the prevention  and control of this sexually transmitted disease as outlined in the MN State Plan.  4. Minneapolis Urban Initiative for Reproductive Health: UMN PRC and the Minneapolis Urban Initiative  for Reproductive Health under the guidance of key stakeholder, Minneapolis Health Department, will  collaborate on development of an innovative model to provide sexual health education to students along with  their teachers and coaches in this large urban school district. We will provide TA on implementation of  evidence-based sexual health curricula in all 6-8th grade classrooms in the district, as well as in the district's  charter and alternative schools. UMN PRC will also provide leadership in development of a program designed  to assist coaches in preventing sexual bullying within school sports teams and among team members.   5. Minneapolis Blueprint for Youth Violence Prevention: Minneapolis and its health department are  widely-recognized for ground-breaking work in implementing a comprehensive, multi-sectorial plan to  prevent youth violence: Blueprint for Action: Preventing Youth Violence. As one of a select group of cities invited  to join the Urban Networks to Increase Thriving Youth (UNITY) through a CDC-funded cooperative  agreement, Minneapolis promotes collaboration across public and private sectors and adoption of a  comprehensive approaches to violence prevention. True to a PH model, the Blueprint lays out 1o, 2o, and 3o  prevention goals along with 34 action steps to reduce and prevent youth violence. An executive committee  including PRC, government, nonprofit, business and youth representation provides oversight.  6. It's That Easy: It's That Easy (ITE) offers parent educators with the training and tools needed to empower  parents to connect with their children, share family values, and engage in conversations about sexuality and  relationships. ITE is a train-the-trainer model for youth-serving organizations and health/education  departments in urban and rural areas as well as culturally-specific groups, e.g., tribal nations. Co-sponsors are  MDH, MDE, and TeenWise MN, a statewide non-profit for teen pregnancy prevention. We will assist in  expanding an ITE dissemination plan and serve as content experts to curriculum and website development.  7. Diffusion of Innovation with State Adolescent Health Resource Center (SAHRC): Given our co- location with SAHRC, we are uniquely poised to promote innovative models of partnership with local and  state health departments reaching national audiences. SAHRC (described in Letter of Support) provides TA to  the nation?s adolescent health staff in state health departments and serves as facilitator for the National  Network of State Adolescent Health Coordinators - the membership organization for all state adolescent  health coordinators. Recognizing that many UMN PRC community-based projects align well with work  underway in other states, UMN PRC will partner with SAHRC to 1) disseminate relevant, highly applied  evidence; 2) frame information for adoption of innovation by highlighting advantages and compatibility with  existing values and practices; 3) facilitate adoption by engaging adolescent health coordinator networks,  identifying an avant-garde of early adopters, and providing them with strategic TA for piloting of innovations.  III. COMMUNICATION AND DISSEMINATION  A. Infrastructure for Communication and Dissemination. UMN PRC offers an infrastructure of resources and  personnel to support communication and dissemination activities with the expertise and capacity to translate  research findings and evidence-based practices to various audiences while aligning with diffusion of  innovation practices. Since its inception in 1996, UMN PRC has prioritized communications/dissemination -  most notably by Resnick, UMN PRC Director (in conjunction with former Division Director, R. Blum), whose  dissemination vision included landmark analyses of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health  and translation of these research findings into a monograph series (supported by the Robert Wood Johnson  Foundation) for specific audience segments (education, health care, parent/family support professionals) as  well as for general public audiences. Dissemination strategies also included partnership with a recognized PR  firm (Burness Communications) that resulted in legislative and national press briefings. Resnick has elevated  this priority by hiring Shea, Communications Team Leader, a marketing and communications professional  with >20 years of communications experience in both hi-tech advertising executive and community/academic  settings. Shea directs all PRC communications activities, sets strategy, framing and messaging direction, writes  copy and handles graphic design assignments. Shea's expertise is sought by local, state, and national partners  and she is frequently asked to consult with adolescent health professionals and organizations. Shea also is  recognized locally for her work on state sexual health plans targeting policy and systems changes including A  Work in Progress: Building a Minnesota State Plan for Teen Pregnancy Prevention and Parenting (2003) and  Recommendations for Action from the UMN Chlamydia Partnership - A Special Report (2012).   Shea and Resnick's work is conducted in collaboration with and informed by UMN PRC members and  community partners (examples below). External vendors with expertise in graphic design, PR/media relations,  video production and social media strategy/production enhance UMN PRC's communications capacity. Given  the scope of proposed communications objectives, a .6 FTE will be added to current staff FTE.    Communications capacity is also supported by the UMN which offers a wealth of communications related  resources including the AHC and University Relations PR and communications staff, AHC computer technical  support, printing and video production capabilities, website design and content management as well as a host  of collaboration (e.g. the Communicators Forum) and training (social media; web technologies) opportunities.   B. Website. UMN PRC has the capacity, expertise and technical support to further develop and maintain a  UMN PRC website. The web infrastructure is supported through the AHC which provides consultants and an  easy-to-use content management system, enabling the PRC to maintain the site locally. UMN has recently  migrated to a suite of Google-powered communication and collaboration tools and, through search engine  optimization, delivers highly ranked Google search results.   C. Communications Plan. UMN PRC will develop a center-wide communications plan, including 5-year goals,  objectives, and activities, that integrates communication activities into research, training, evaluation, and  community activities. In the past PRC funding cycle, we created communications plans for partner  organizations: Hennepin County, the UMN Chlamydia Partnership, Public Health departments in Kandiyohi  County and the city of Worthington and Iowa's Youth Development Initiative.   The formal UMN PRC Communications plan will be developed in collaboration with PRC center and core  research project faculty and staff, CAN, community partners, local and national public health departments as  well as advisors fro...",1915141; ,"SIEVING, RENEE E;","DARLING, NATALIE ",9/30/2014,9/29/2019,,Healthy Youth Development Prevention Research Center,5022,ZDP1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,4,,,1313999,

Even those cured of HCV infection remain at elevated risk for HCC. Exactly how HCV drives hepatocyte transformation is unknown, but its ability to disrupt the epigenome is emerging as one important, yet still understudied, mechanism. It is therefore critical to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the DNA epigenetic marks in normal and HCV- infected liver during disease progression to understand how HCV induced changes in DNA epigenetic marks lead to cirrhosis and how they may be utilized to develop novel treatments and diagnostic tools to improve patient survival and quality of life.

Surgical treatment of CTS is generally effective. However, revision rates of 3-20%, given the prevalence of CTS, correspond to a substantial number of patients. We propose applying new non-invasive imaging methods to more accurately diagnose the etiology of CTS, by characterizing nerve structure and mechanics with high contrast and sensitivity in patients undergoing surgical treatment of CTS. Our imaging methods may also be applied more broadly to other neurological conditions in which nerve structure and biomechanics are altered, including other neuropathies and traumatic nerve injury.

Similarly, exposure to a warm environment inhibits thermogenesis. However, there are examples in nature where these skin thermal stimuli produce inverted thermoregulatory responses. Hibernation is the most representative example of thermoregulatory inversion, in which exposure to cold weather induces an inhibition of thermogenesis in hibernating animals that allows their core temperature to fall. Similarly, exposure to a warm environment can trigger an arousal from hibernation by activating thermogenesis. We have recently demonstrated the ability to pharmacologically induce a hibernating-like state in rats, a non-hibernating species. In this proposal, we will study the state of thermoregulatory inversion to understand the central neural circuit mechanisms which underlie its reversed thermoregulatory reflex responses. Supported by a series of strong preliminary data, we will show a novel thermoregulatory pathway, and identify neurotransmitters involved in mediating inverted thermoregulatory responses in the rat, which is not normally capable of entering a torpor-like state.

Taking advantage of our continued advance in UCB-derived allogenic stem cell therapy, we will further develop innovative diffusion MRI methodologies with greatly increased sensitivity and accuracy to investigate connectivity changes in relevant brain networks.

We will use a new approach -- massively parallel carbon fiber microwires -- to obtain single unit, multi-unit, local field potential and oxygen data with unprecedented spatial resolution and range. This will allow us to understand the dynamical system of neuronal activity that underlies functional connectivity, to determine the role of long-range correlations in brain function, and to understand how slow long-range correlations interact with on-going task-based responses.

Most signals are received by cells at the plasma membrane, which forms the physical barrier and functional interface between a cell and its environment. To ensure accurate signal transmission, membranes are subdivided into functional compartments, or domains, that segregate membrane proteins and lipids for optimal functionality. Although there is clear evidence that plasma membranes are compartmentalized, and that disruption of this compartmentalization leads to dysfunction, it remains unclear how proteins are recruited to specific domains and how this recruitment affects cell function. We are investigating these basic questions with the long-term goal of designing drugs that interfere with membrane partitioning for treatment of disease states defined by aberrant plasma membrane signal transduction, including cancer, autoimmune disease, and cardiovascular disease. !",8145040; ,"LEVENTAL, ILYA ;","DEATHERAGE, JAMES F.",9/30/2017,8/31/2021,Affect; Affinity; Alpha Cell; Amino Acid Sequence; Area; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmunity; Automobile Driving; base; Bioinformatics; Biological Models; Biophysics; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cell membrane; Cell physiology; Cells; Cellular biology; Cellular Membrane; Characteristics; Charge; Computer Simulation; Data; design; Disease; Drug Design; Endocytosis; Endosomes; Ensure; Environment; experimental study; Face; Functional disorder; Goals; heuristics; Image; Immune; insight; Integral Membrane Protein; Investigation; Lateral; Length; Lipids; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammalian Cell; Measurement; Mediating; Membrane; Membrane Lipids; Membrane Microdomains; Membrane Protein Traffic; Membrane Proteins; Methodology; Modeling; Molecular; molecular modeling; Molecular Models; Mutation; Nature; Pathway interactions; Phase; physical model; physical property; Plasma; preference; prevent; Protein Sortings; protein transport; Proteins; Proteome; public health relevance; Quantitative Evaluations; Recruitment Activity; Recycling; Role; Signal Transduction; small molecule; Sorting - Cell Movement; Structure; Surface; synergism; System; Testing; Thinness; trafficking; Transmembrane Domain; transmission process; Variant; ,Structural determinants and functional consequences of protein partitioning to ordered membrane microdomains,124072,BBM,Biochemistry and Biophysics of Membranes Study Section ,,,1,196500,106110,302610,

Given that poor sleep is one of the most common concerns in this newly retuning cohort of Veterans, a behavioral treatment that directly addresses insomnia in this group is of utmost importance to the VA. We also know that Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans report serious barriers to seeking care in mental health clinics, where behavioral insomnia treatment is most commonly provided, and that those most in need are least likely to seek services.

Alterations (e.g. point mutations) in such proteins, primarily the dynamin superfamily, have been linked to been linked to neurological disorders in humans, including epilepsy, centronuclear myopathy and others. One of the major hurdles in developing therapeutics against these pathologies is the extreme complexity of the associated protein interactomes. Dynamins, through their specialized domains, interact with a large variety of proteins involved in membrane remodeling and signaling networks. The effects of the mutations associated with the different pathologies are equally complex. Many mutations also do not display a distinct dominant negative phenotype, and seem to be affecting kinetics of membrane fission through yet unidentified mechanisms. The knowledge and experimental tools generated by this project are expected to advance our mechanistic understanding of the malfunctions of dynamins directly associated with membrane fission, distinguish them from those associated with other functions of dynamins, and develop in vitro diagnostic tools to analyze the kinetic effects of dynamin mutations in the context of variable lipid/protein environment at biologically relevant length- and time- scales.

Further, it is common for patients with vestibular disorders, elderly patients, and patients with Alzheimer?s disease, a disease often associated with marked pathology in limbic system structures, to experience spatial disorientation to the extent that constant supervision is required.

Nearly half of patients diagnosed with diabetes - both type 1 and type 2 - suffer from diabetic retinopathy. The retina has one of the highest metabolic demands in the human body, and requires neuronal control of blood flow to maintain uninterrupted delivery of oxygen and other nutrients. From its onset, diabetic retinopathy is characterized by the inability of blood supply to match neuronal demand. In the retina, most of these interactions take place at the level of capillaries, where specialized vascular cells adjust blood flow in response to neuronal signals. The goal of this project is to determine how the altered interactions between these vascular cells and neurons lead to disrupted blood flow control in diabetes. Altered retinal blood flow is an early consequence of the disease, and may contribute to the further complications in vascular health that occur as the disease progresses.

Middle school children with asthma have greater morbidity than children from any other age group and spend a majority of their day in school, where they must manage any asthma. We developed and piloted a novel group- based intervention - ASMAS (Asthma Self-MAnagement in Schools) in two geographic areas with a high prevalence of urban and Latino children with asthma: Providence, Rhode Island, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. ASMAS is a 4-session, peer-facilitated asthma self-management intervention specific to the school setting for Latino middle school (6th-8th graders) children. It is delivered by trained High School Juniors and Seniors of Latino descent with asthma. We demonstrated the preliminary effects of ASMAS for improving asthma outcomes and self-management relative to controls. In this proposal, we will evaluate ASMAS through a large- scaled Randomized Control Trial with urban middle school students who have persistent asthma in Providence, RI and San Juan, Puerto Rico and we will identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of ASMAS.

Studies suggest that kidneys donated by patients with these genetic variants may negatively impact the long-term function of the transplanted organ and may put kidney donors at risk to develop high blood pressure and/or kidney disease. Before organ donation can be denied to a category of patients carrying these genetic variants, a large national scale study based on a strong network-based team effort is needed. Furthermore, the risk attributable to APOL1 genotype needs to be studied in all populations carrying a certain degree of African ancestry, such as Latino patients from the Southeast US found within our region.
