Patients may fail initial therapies (innate resistance) or  experience drug resistant relapses (acquired resistance). We hypothesize that a direct to drug analysis of  individual patients measuring over 80 clinically available, CTEP or promising clinical trial agents alone or in  combination, will overcome innate or acquired resistance, improve response rates, lower unnecessary toxicity  and reduce drug costs. To test this hypothesis we will identify the relationships between genomic or clinical  characteristics of MM patient samples in light of their sensitivity and resistance to MM therapeutics. This  strategy will also, for the purposes of this proposal, provide a database of samples and clinical data sets from  which to explore genomic or clinical correlates of drug sensitivity and resistance in Projects 2 and 3.","6062161; ","STEWART, ALEXANDER KEITH;","","09/30/2017","08/31/2019","Acoustics; Address; Aftercare; Alternative Therapies; Animal Model; base; Biological Markers; Bromodomain; Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program; Cell Line; Cells; Characteristics; Chronic; Clinical; Clinical Data; clinical phenotype; Clinical Trials; Data; Data Analyses; Data Set; Databases; Disease; DNA Library; DNA Sequence Alteration; Dose; Drug Combinations; Drug Costs; Drug resistance; drug sensitivity; Elements; Epigenetic Process; experience; FDA approved; Feedback; Frequencies; gene panel; Genetic Transcription; Genomics; Goals; Grant; high throughput screening; Human; Immune; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; individual patient; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; Investigation; Laboratories; Light; Link; Measures; Methodology; Mosaicism; Multiple Myeloma; Mus; Mutation; mutational status; novel drug combination; oncology; Outcome; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase II Clinical Trials; Preclinical Drug Evaluation; prevent; programs; Proteasome Inhibition; Proteasome Inhibitor; Proteomics; Relapse; Resistance; resistance gene; resistance mechanism; response; RNA library; Robotics; Route; Sampling; screening; Source; synergism; System; targeted treatment; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Clinical Trial; Toxic effect; transcriptome sequencing; Work; ","Project 1 - High Throughtput Drug Screening and Correlations with Mutational Status in Myeloma Cell Lines and Patient Samples","224018","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","8402","","01","524393","229344","","753737"
