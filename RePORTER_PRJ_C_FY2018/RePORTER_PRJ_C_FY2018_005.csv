Military personnel are at increased risk of DVT due to significant periods of travel, prolonged evacuation times, dehydration, and tobacco use. Over half of the surgical patients at Veterans Affair Medical Centers develop VTE. The incidence in Veterans is likely to increase due to increasing age and obesity. Existing therapies for DVT rely on anticoagulants, which do not enhance resolution of the clots, but only prevent further clot development. Delayed or incomplete clot resolution frequently leads to post- thrombotic syndrome- a long-term complication associated with debilitating limb swelling, pain, and recurrent skin ulceration.

We developed an acupuncture (ACU) treatment for PTSD in order to broaden treatment options. Our first study showed that it helped most people. However, we need better scientific evidence that it works by comparing ACU to a placebo, such as 'sham' acupuncture (fewer needles in non-important sites) and determining if ACU alters abnormal physiology in PTSD. In this study 90 Veterans will be randomly assigned (like a coin flip) to receive either ACU or sham. We expect to find that the ACU treated patients have more improvement in PTSD and in physiology (less startle reaction - assessed non-invasively using skin sensors) than the patients in the sham group.

It is seen more commonly in individuals who have served in the military, and thus is of particular interest to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The prevalence of OA is increasing rapidly; it is projected that by 2030, over 60 million Americans will be affected. Current treatments for OA are only marginally effective in treating pain, and none have been shown to alter the progression of OA. Degenerative joint cartilage is a central feature of OA, yet joint cartilage has a limited capacity for repair. Results from animal research demonstrate that pulsed low intensity ultrasound (PLIUS) mechanically stimulates, and may promote, cartilage repair. This exploratory trial will investigate whether PLIUS is potentially effective as a disease and symptom modifying intervention in 160 patients with early knee OA. If sufficient evidence of efficacy is observed, it would strongly support further clinic research in humans.

While neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis have received considerable attention as potential etiologies for dementia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), that also produces significant neurocognitive sequelae remains unrecognized as a cause. This is surprising given that the prevalence of sleep apnea in elderly Veterans has been estimated to be up to 40%. Moreover, chronic lung disease, particularly COPD, is now also thought to contribute to cognitive decline possibly through hypoxic injury to the brain. However, it is not known whether OSA coexisting with COPD will enhance the risk for cognitive dysfunction. Thus, we sought to investigate whether these two highly prevalent diseases, that often co-exist as the 'Overlap Syndrome', combine to enhance cognitive impairment in the elderly Veteran population. Additionally, treatment of OSA with positive airway pressure (PAP) has been shown to improve neurocognitive function in moderate-to-severe OSA while cognitive decline in COPD may be reversible through treatment with long-term oxygen therapy. Thus, it is conceivable that developing treatment strategies that target the pathophysiological underpinnings of the Overlap Syndrome, aimed at repairing hypoxia and arousal-induced 'brain injury', will allow recovery of neurocognitive function. Specific Aim 1 will investigate whether elderly Veterans with the Overlap Syndrome have increased neurocognitive deficits compared with OSA or COPD alone. Specific Aim 2 will further study the Overlap Syndrome group to determine whether treatment with CPAP and supplemental oxygen vs. CPAP alone will improve neurocognitive function and reduce sleepiness in conjunction with improved quality of life. Thus, using a novel dual-pronged strategy we hope to eventually delay the onset of dementia in a high-risk Veteran population. This pilot project will allow us to determine feasibility and sample size for a future larger long-term trial. Ultimately, our goal is to enhance rehabilitation and recovery from injury caused by two chronic conditions and thus, improve the overall health and quality of life of elderly Veterans.",9234673; ,"CHOWDHURI, SUSMITA ;",,8/1/2016,7/31/2018,Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Animals; Area; Arousal; Attention; base; Brain; Brain Injuries; Chronic; Chronic lung disease; Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease; Clinic; Clinical; clinical care; Clinical Trials; Cognitive deficits; cognitive enhancement; cognitive function; cognitive testing; Comorbidity; Continuous Positive Airway Pressure; Data; Dementia; Detection; disability; Disease; Drowsiness; Early Diagnosis; Elderly; Ensure; Etiology; Functional disorder; Future; Goals; Health; Health system; High Prevalence; high risk; Hypoxia; Impaired cognition; improved; improved outcome; Inflammation; Injury; innovation; Investigation; Link; Mediating; Mental Depression; mortality; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurocognition; Neurocognitive; Neurocognitive Deficit; neurocognitive disorder; neurocognitive test; Neurodegenerative Disorders; novel; novel therapeutics; Obstructive Sleep Apnea; older patient; Outcome; Oxygen; Oxygen Therapy Care; Parkinson Disease; patient oriented; Patients; personalized therapeutic; Pilot Projects; Policies; Population; pressure; Prevalence; prospective; public health relevance; Quality of life; Questionnaires; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; Recovery; Rehabilitation therapy; repaired; Research; Risk; Risk Factors; Sample Size; Severities; Sleep Apnea Syndromes; stroke; Syndrome; Therapeutic Intervention; treatment strategy; Veterans; ,Impact of Sleep Apnea in Elderly Veterans with Comorbid COPD,2227,RRDS,Rehabilitation Research and Development SPiRE Program ,,,2,,,,

In FOP, the underlying mutation misdirects the fates of cells, producing cartilage and bone in soft tissues such as skeletal muscle. In addition to ligand-receptor signaling, physical biomechanical cues derived from the surrounding environment direct cell fate decisions, with stiff substrates promoting chondrogenic and osteogenic fates and softer substrates promoting neurogenic, adipogenic, and myogenic cell fates. This proposal seeks to identify the influence of elevated BMP signaling conferred by the Acvr1R206H mutation on cellular mechanical signal transduction (also known as mechanotransduction) and cell differentiation, and the effects of the mutation on the muscle tissue microenvironment following injury and the muscle stem cell population during muscle regeneration in order to identify therapeutic targets to treat FOP.",14149356; ,"STANLEY, ALEXANDRA KATHERINE;","CHEN, FAYE H",9/1/2017,8/31/2020,Abnormal Cell; Actins; ACVR1 gene; Affect; Alpha Cell; Area; Atomic Force Microscopy; Biomechanics; Blast Cell; bone; bone cell; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins; Cartilage; cartilage cell; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Lineage; Cell model; Cell surface; Cell Surface Receptors; Cells; Cellular Mechanotransduction; Cellular Morphology; Chondrogenesis; Chromatin; Clinical; Connective and Soft Tissue; Cues; Data; Embryo; Environment; Event; experimental study; Fibroblasts; gain of function; gain of function mutation; gene induction; Genetic; Hereditary Disease; Heterotopic Ossification; Impairment; in vivo; injured; Injury; insight; Intervention; Lead; Ligands; lipid biosynthesis; Measurement; Mechanics; Mechanoreceptors; mechanotransduction; Mediating; Mesenchymal; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Morphology; mouse model; Mus; Muscle; muscle regeneration; Muscle satellite cell; Mutation; myogenesis; Natural regeneration; non-genetic; Operative Surgical Procedures; Osteogenesis; osteogenic; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Patients; Perception; Pharmacologic Substance; Physical environment; Play; Population; Process; progenitor; progressive myositis ossificans; Proliferating; receptor; receptor function; Receptor Signaling; repaired; Replacement Arthroplasty; Research; response; response to injury; rho; rhoA GTP-Binding Protein; Role; Series; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Signaling Protein; Site; Skeletal Muscle; soft tissue; Stem cells; Stress Fibers; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; tissue regeneration; tissue trauma; Tissues; Transplantation; Wound Healing; ,Intersection of Upregulated BMP Signaling & Cellular Mechanotransduction in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP),69982,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,A1,1,43576,,43576,

However, it is not clear why only some veterans in this risk group eventually develop HFpEF. Extensive information from experimental animal models and some human studies suggests that dietary patterns in vulnerable `salt-sensitive' people could contribute to the risk for HFpEF. Reducing salt intake and increasing overall dietary quality in at-risk veterans could prevent heart and blood vessel damage that ultimately leads to HFpEF.

Thus there is an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. We have identified a novel and protective role for the coagulation protein Tissue Factor (TF) in ARDS that is in distinct contrast to much of the existing knowledge of TF in ARDS. Despite encouraging animal studies suggesting that blocking TF may protect the lung, human studies have not shown benefit from blocking TF using an intravenous therapy in patients with ARDS. Our studies in mouse and human lung injury models suggest that one reason for these negative clinical studies is that TF is protective in the lung. Our project will help to understand how TF protects lung cells from injury. Furthermore we have found that a therapy targeted at enhancing TF function, coagulation factor VII, is protective in ARDS and could change the way we treat patients with this deadly condition.",8791484; ,"BASTARACHE, JULIE ANNE;",,10/1/2017,9/30/2021,Abnormal Cell; Actins; Acute Lung Injury; Acute respiratory failure; Adhesions; Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Affect; Alveolar; Alveolar Macrophages; American; Animals; Anticoagulants; Attenuated; Binding; Biological Models; Blood capillaries; Blood Coagulation Factor VII; Cancer Biology; capillary; Cell Adhesion; cell injury; Cell Line; Cell Migration Pathway; cell motility; Cell surface; Cells; Clinical; clinical efficacy; Clinical Research; clinically relevant; Coagulants; Coagulation Process; Complex; Computer Simulation; Cultured Cells; Data; Development; Ensure; Epithelial; Epithelial Cells; Epithelium; Experimental Designs; experimental study; extracellular; Extracellular Domain; Fibrin; Foundations; Generations; Genetic; Goals; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammatory; Injury; insight; Integral Membrane Protein; Integrin Binding; Integrins; Intravenous; Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium; Knock-out; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Libraries; Life; Ligand Binding; Ligands; Link; Lipopolysaccharides; Lung; lung injury; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Measurement; Mediating; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; mortality; mouse model; Mus; mutant; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; overexpression; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Patients; Permeability; Pharmacologic Substance; Pharmacology; Prevention approach; protective effect; Proteins; Publishing; Recombinants; Research Personnel; Resources; response; Role; skills; Structural Protein; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic evaluation; Thrombin; Thromboplastin; Transgenic Mice; Type II Epithelial Receptor Cell; Up-Regulation; Veterans; Work; ,Potential Protective Mechanisms of Tissue Factor in Acute Lung Injury,2288,PULM,Respiration ,,A2,1,,,,

Some individuals remain lean in the face of overfeeding, and a high level of NEAT predisposes one to be thin. A discovery made by our lab is the finding that the natural brain chemical called orexin (which occurs in humans) initiates NEAT. Our goal is to understand the parts of the brain in which orexin works so that we can develop therapies for humans based on increasing NEAT. To obtain knowledge needed to do this, we will study mouse brain orexin circuits and possible treatment strategies. This will help determine how best to develop orexin-based treatments for obesity and other brain mechanisms that promote NEAT. We will use a new technology (DREADDS) that allows us to stimulate and monitor the activity of orexin neurons. We will also determine if serotonin affects NEAT.

Sun exposure is part of the daily life for U.S. troops, and the exposure during US military service has been linked to increased melanoma incidence. Furthermore, melanoma is more common than other cancers in young women, an increasingly significant population in the VA and in the active-duty military. Despite the progress in breakthrough therapeutics over the last several years, melanoma remains a challenge in clinical oncology. An immune response to melanoma cells is often generated and augmented by therapeutics, however tumor cells escape from the destruction. Thus, understanding mechanisms responsible for immune escape is critical for the successful treatment of melanoma and prevention of tumor relapse for VA patients. We found that human melanoma cells exhibit a feature of IL-1-mediated autoinflammation and that an immunosuppressive cytokine, IL-37, is elevated in melanoma blood samples.
