In the past funding period, this model organism has unveiled novel functions of monocytes during viral infection as well as previously unsuspected role of necroptosis in host defense. These transformative discoveries included the fact that the cell death pathways unleashed during virus infection may be dysregulated during development or tissue homeostasis to cause death or inflammatory disease in the animal.
