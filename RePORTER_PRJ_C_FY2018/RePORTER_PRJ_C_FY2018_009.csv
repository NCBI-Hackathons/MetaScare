Although steroids are effective in reducing overt symptoms, studies have shown that approximately half of all patients are refractory to steroid treatment, with limited ulcer healing. We have identified a new type of intestinal stem cell that i involved in healing ulcers. The goal of this project is to identify which types of cells are involvd in ulcer healing, and to understand how the activity of those cells is regulated.

The proposed work will determine how TRAF3 normally prevents excess B cell survival, how abnormal survival of B cells lacking normal amounts of TRAF3 occurs, and potential ways this can be blocked.",1902028; ,"BISHOP, GAIL A.;",,10/1/2012,9/30/2020,Adaptor Signaling Protein; Address; Age; age group; agent orange; Aging; Antibody-Producing Cells; Autoantibodies; Autoimmune Diseases; B lymphoid malignancy; B-Cell Activation; B-Cell Development; B-Cell Lymphomas; B-Cell Neoplasm; B-lymphocyte Cancer; B-Lymphocytes; Biological Models; Blood Cells; cancer cell; Cell membrane; Cell Survival; cell type; Cells; Cessation of life; clinically relevant; Disease; Disease remission; Drug Compounding; Drug resistance; Event; evidence base; Funding; Gender; Genes; Genetic; Goals; Hematologic Neoplasms; Herbicides; Human; improved; Incidence; Infiltration; inhibitor/antagonist; Ionizing radiation; Knowledge; Leukocytes; Libraries; Lifetime Risk; loss of function; Lymphoid; Lymphoma; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Membrane; men; mouse model; Multiple Myeloma; Mus; Mutation; Nuclear; Organ; Outcome; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Play; Population; Predisposition; prevent; Prevention; Process; Production; Proliferating; Proteins; receptor; Recurrence; Regulation; Relapse; restraint; Risk; Role; Sampling; Services; Signal Transduction; small molecule; Survival Rate; Therapeutic; Time; Tissues; TLR5 gene; TNF receptor-associated factor 3; TNFRSF5 gene; tumor; Veterans; Work; ,TRAF3 as a key regulator of B cell survival pathways,1702,HEMA,Hematology ,,,6,,,,

Many affected veterans have problems with thinking and memory and brain scans have shown abnormal brain structure. The cause of GWVI is not known but it may be related to exposure to environmental toxins. GW veterans may also be at increased risk for progressive brain problems such as Alzheimer's disease due to accelerated brain aging and long-term effects of brain injuries. Scientists in the field agree that more studies using human brain tissue obtained after death are vital to accelerate research on GWVI.

Colorectal cancer (CRC), aging associated cancer, is the third deadliest cancer in the US. Survival of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which play a key role in cancer recurrence, is a major barrier in achieving desired therapeutic success. Although, IGF-1R based therapies have demonstrated remarkable activities against these CSCs in the laboratory, it has failed to translate into clinical benefit so far. We have uncovered a novel mechanism of IGF-1R inhibition's effect on suppressing CSCs growth through a pathway that regulates cholesterol synthesis. As there are drugs already targeting this pathway in clinics, it led us to develop a novel therapeutic strategy of achieving maximum inhibition of CSCs through a combination strategy maximally affecting cholesterol synthesis pathway. This is an exciting and a significant development for CRC therapy as many of the proposed drug combinations require using FDA- approved drugs, raising high hopes for immediate commencement of a clinical trial based on these findings.

Showing the impact on veterans, in 1998, the VA provided 4,822 hospitalizations for peripheral vascular procedures, and unfortunately 5,329 hospitalizations for limb amputation. Our goal is to develop a novel graft that will significantly improve patient outcomes following bypass grafting, thereby preventing limb amputation.

The work here will defne the downstream actions of ACTH in human bone cells and in a mouse model, including the interactions of ACTH with other systems that regulate VEGF.

Even though there is an 'epidemic' of hepatitis C in the U.S. and the Veterans Administration, alcohol-related liver injury remains a higher cause of mortality. Studies from the Veterans Administration showed that patients with cirrhosis and superimposed alcoholic hepatitis had > 60% mortality over a four-year period of time, with most of those deaths occurring in the first few months. Thus, the prognosis for this stage of ALD is worse than many common types of cancer, such as breast, prostate and colon. Unfortunately, there is no FDA-approved therapy for any stage of ALD, and this makes the need for this proposed research even more compelling. The proposed studies will help to better understand the molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced liver and intestinal injury, including alcohol-diet interactions, which may lead to identification of new therapeutic targets and potential dietary interventions for treating ALD, as well as help to explain why only some heavy drinkers develop clinically important ALD.",1902075; ,"MCCLAIN, CRAIG J.;",,10/1/2016,9/30/2020,Ablation; Address; Affect; Alcohol abuse; Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker; Alcoholic Hepatitis; Alcoholic Liver Diseases; Alcohols; Animal Model; Animals; Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase; Attenuated; base; Blood; Breast; cancer type; Cations; Cell Death; Cessation of life; Chronic; Cirrhosis; Clinical; Colon; cytokine; Data; Development; Diet; Dietary Fats; Dietary Intervention; endoplasmic reticulum stress; Enzymes; Epidemic; Etiology; Experimental Animal Model; Fatty Liver; FDA approved; Genetic; Health; Health Care Costs; Heavy Drinking; Hepatic; Hepatitis C; Hepatocyte; Hepatotoxicity; Human; human study; In Vitro; in vitro testing; in vivo; Inflammasome; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; Injury; Interleukin-1 beta; Interleukin-18; Intestines; Knockout Mice; Kupffer Cells; Laboratories; Lead; Ligands; Link; Linoleic Acids; Liver; liver inflammation; liver injury; macrophage; Mediating; mitochondrial dysfunction; Molecular; monocyte; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; new therapeutic target; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; novel; octadecadienoic acid; outcome forecast; oxidation; Oxides; Pathogenesis; Patients; peripheral blood; Permeability; Pharmacology; Play; Population; Prostate; public health relevance; Publishing; receptor; Research; Role; Signal Transduction; Steatohepatitis; stressor; therapeutic target; Time; toxicant; Translating; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Unsaturated Fats; Up-Regulation; Vanilloid; Veterans; Whole Blood; ,Dietary Fat and Alcoholic Liver Disease,2996,GAST,Gastroenterology ,,,2,,,,

Reducing blood pressure to normal levels decreases the morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension, but does not reduce it to background levels. The etiology underlying the development of hypertension is unknown, but investigators have demonstrated that suppressed renal prostaglandin metabolism induces sodium retention, a critical first step to become hypertensive. In this research application, we identify a novel mechano-sensor in kidney that is dysregulated by cholesterol, leads to suppressed prostaglandin synthesis, renal Na retention and hypertension.

For reasons that are not clear, the prevalence of T2DM among people receiving care in the VA, ~20%, is at least twice that of the US population in general, 10%. Thus, diabetes is one of the major disease burdens for the VA health care system and a condition that has an enormous impact on morbidity, mortality and economic costs.

We will expand and elaborate on our study in non-Veterans that showed a 'Resiliency Index' based on patient movement data correlated more strongly with suicidal ideation than any other characteristic.

The results from the proposed experiments will be key to develop new therapies for patients with cancer anorexia and cachexia, thereby improving quality of life. By increasing muscle mass and function, Veterans may also tolerate more effective treatments and have a better chance to fight the disease.

Since these findings were made in vitro and it is important to confirm the findings in vivo, we proposed to study how feeding high saturated fatty acid diet and administration of LPS in diabetic animal models increase vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis through an interplay between toll-like receptor (TLR)4 signaling and sphingolipid pathway.

Using robust preliminary data and a 'toolbox' of approaches to directly measure the treatment effects on bladder cancer cells, the investigators will define how established treatments affect a tumor response. Based on this, the researchers will design and test strategies to increase treatment effectiveness and reduce treatment-associated risks.

There remains no reliable treatment modality for acute kidney injury that has impacted the dismal survival statistics. Clearly new approaches are urgently required. In the setting of ischemia or hypoxic injury, early alterations in mitochondrial structure impair cellular energetics, activate cell death pathways, increase oxygen free radical generation and may influence renal hemodynamics. Different models of naturally or experimentally induced resistance to ischemic injury may help to identify biochemical, cellular and physiological events underlying the injury process and provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The confluence of data suggests that an enhanced regulation of stress related proteins or mitochondria regulated energetics may impart protection in animal models of resistance to AKI The overarching hypothesis of this application is that mitochondrial adaptation to hypoxia entrains mitochondria toward a biosynthetic activity and decreased ATP generative activity. This adaptation has common features in cells primed by ischemia preconditioning or background genetic traits that confer resistance to ischemia. In these studies, we will utilize two different models of resistance to AKI; 1) a genetic model of the Brown Norway rat and Brown Norway derived consomic strains of rats, and 2) a model of experimentally induced ischemic preconditioning to determine proteins that confer ischemic protection. Studies in specific objective 1 will test the hypothesis that genetic and experimentally induced models of resistance to I/R (ischemia/reperfusion) have common biochemical properties at the level of the mitochondria. These experiments will utilize a proteomic approach of label- free-quantitative mass spectroscopy to identify biochemical similarities in different models of resistance. Studies in specific objective 2 will investigate the potential protective effect of proteins identified in resistant states. Mitochondrial targeted genes derived from specific aim 1 will be tested an in vitro model of proximal tubule cells and the preservation of mitochondrial function and cellular integrity in response to hypoxia evaluated. Studies in specific objective 3 will evaluate the effec of mitochondrial targeting on the short and long-term response to kidney injury in vivo. Specific objective 4 will study how mitochondria adapt in response to transgene expression, ischemia preconditioning or genetic modifications. These studies will investigate post-ischemic mitochondria respiratory capacity, mitochondrial polarization and the resulting influence on ROS generation and renal hemodynamics.

Problems with current treatment strategies include issues with relapse, recurrence, and instances where antibiotics fail to alter the disease process (no response). CDI pathology is associated with the action of two toxins, TcdA and TcdB.

The negative impact of this devastating disease on Veterans will increase enormously unless the mechanisms of post-stroke brain damage are deciphered and new therapies are developed. An avenue for studying this damage is offered by neurodegenation that many Veterans show in later life. A protein, a-Synuclein, is a proponent of neurodegeneration, and interestingly, we found that this protein is also induced after stroke. Hence, we wish to test if a-Synuclein can be targeted to curtail post-stroke brain damage that might also help to minimize the motor dysfunction.

Insomnia and disturbed sleep are common features in these and other mood and anxiety disorders. Chronic hyperactivity in brain corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) systems has been linked to PTSD and depression. Building on findings from the previous funding period, experiments proposed here are designed to identify critical sleep regulatory circuits targeted by CRF and evaluate the hypothesis that elevated CRF signaling during chronic mild-moderate stress causes disruption of fundamental diencephalic and brainstem circuits that regulate sleep homeostasis. The goal is to identify critical nodes in these circuits that can be targeted for therapeutic interventions. Severity of insomnia and sleep disturbance have been linked to symptom severity and recurrence in PTSD and depression. Preservation of sleep homeostasis during chronic stress may be a strategy to promote stress resilience and improve outcomes in mood and anxiety disorders.",2429640; ,"SZYMUSIAK, RONALD ;",,10/1/2011,9/30/2020,Acute; Address; Adenosine; Adverse effects; Amygdaloid structure; Anxiety Disorders; Architecture; Axon; Behavioral; Biological Preservation; Brain; Brain Stem; Cell Nucleus; Chronic; Chronic stress; Circadian desynchrony; Circadian Rhythms; Clozapine; Cognitive; combat; common symptom; Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone; Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptors; CRH gene; Data; density; design; Development; Disease; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug usage; Endocrine; experimental study; Female; FOS gene; Funding; Goals; Health; Homeostasis; Hyperactive behavior; Hypothalamic dysfunction; Hypothalamic structure; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; immunoreactivity; Impairment; improved outcome; Infusion procedures; Injection of therapeutic agent; Knock-in Mouse; Laboratories; Light; light effects; Link; Maintenance; male; Mediating; Mental Depression; Mental disorders; Metabolism; Microdialysis; Microinjections; modifiable risk; Mood Disorders; Mus; Neurobiology; Neurons; Neuropeptides; Opsin; Outcome; Oxides; paraventricular nucleus; Pattern; Phase; Physiologic pulse; Physiological; Population; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; prevent; Process; Psychological Stress; Rattus; receptor; Recovery; Recurrence; response; Rhodopsin; Risk Factors; Role; Severities; Signal Transduction; Sleep; Sleep Deprivation; Sleep disturbances; sleep onset; sleep regulation; Sleeplessness; Stress; stress resilience; stressor; Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region; suprachiasmatic nucleus; Symptoms; System; targeted treatment; Therapeutic Intervention; Training; Veterans; Wakefulness; Work; ,Impact of Corticotropin Releasing Factor on Sleep Regulation,1556,NURR,Neurobiology R ,,,6,,,,

BPH/LUTS is a prevalent condition among aging men in general but recent studies show an even higher incidence among Veterans and, in addition, a significant association with PTSD. Despite being a major health issue for Veterans, a recent Veterans Administration study reveals that most Veterans with BPH/LUTS are not being treated properly. In part, this is attributable to the complex nature of BPH/LUTS and failure of primary physicians to offer appropriate treatment. We expect our research to provide important new insight into the development of BPH/LUTS and its treatment.

Cardiovascular disease is a prominent cause of mortality among veterans, and hypertension leads to severe cardiovascular complications including end-stage kidney disease. Virtually all forms of chronic kidney disease (CKD) including that seen in hypertension culminate in kidney fibrosis that predicts organ failure. Thus, treatments that curtail organ damage in hypertension and ameliorate kidney fibrosis are desperately needed. To design precise treatments that minimize unintended off-target effects, we must elucidate the cellular mechanisms governing cytokine elaboration within inflammatory cells during hypertension and kidney fibrosis. Identifying the actions of mononuclear cells infiltrating the kidney to drive kidney damage and fibrosis will benefit the veteran population by leading to the rational design of potent, immune-directed therapies to prevent and/or slow the progression of CKD.",6979868; ,"CROWLEY, STEVEN D;",,1/1/2012,9/30/2020,"Angiotensin II; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers; Attenuated; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular system; Cells; Chronic; Chronic Kidney Failure; Cicatrix; cytokine; Cytokine Receptors; defined contribution; design; Disease model; Disease Progression; Elderly; End stage renal failure; Fibrosis; Generations; GKLF protein; Hypertension; Immunotherapy; improved; Individual; Inflammatory; Infusion procedures; Injury; Innate Immune Response; Interleukin-1; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Kruppel-like transcription factors; Losartan; macrophage; Macrophage Activation; Measures; Mediating; Modeling; Mononuclear; mortality; Mus; Myelogenous; Organ; Organ failure; Pathogenicity; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Platelet Factor 4; Play; Population; prevent; Production; protective effect; receptor; Receptor Activation; Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1; Renin-Angiotensin System; Residual state; response; Role; Severities; Shapes; Testing; Tissues; TNF gene; Tumor Necrosis Factor Activation; Tumor Necrosis Factor Suppression; United States; Ureteral obstruction; Veterans; virtual; Wild Type Mouse; ",The role of the M1 macrophage response in the progression of chronic kidney disease,893,NEPH,Nephrology ,,,6,,,,
