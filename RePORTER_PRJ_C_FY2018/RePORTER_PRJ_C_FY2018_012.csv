The studies outlined in this proposal will enhance our understanding of the role of histone modifications and nucleosome location acting coordinately in controlling accessibility of DNA for binding by regulatory factors.

Based on biochemical, cellular and animal experimental data showing protective, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and antioxidant effect, the use of nitrated fatty acid is now undergoing clinical trials for chronic kidney disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Five phase I clinical trials have been conducted for nitrated oleic acid and studies are being performed on conjugated linoleic acid plus nitrite/nitrates treatments in obese asthmatics. The rapid advance in these preclinical and clinical areas sharply contrast the paucity of information on formation, absorption, transport, tissue distribution and protein targets of nitrated fatty acids. Thus, we propose to define the formation yields of nitrated fatty acids in the gastric compartment, the role of incorporation into triglycerides and chylomicrons in their systemic transport and establish the protein targets that modulate their signaling activities.

Many patients do not recover fully with some remaining in a state of impaired consciousness and minimal cognitive function. Altered functional connectivity within the cortico- basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit is associated with impaired cognitive functions but the exact neuronal mechanisms governing recovery are yet to be understood. Intervention studies have shown divergent findings regarding possible targets. However, recent therapeutic strategies such as deep-brain stimulation focus entirely on the thalamus ignoring the circuit as a whole. The goal of this study is to understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying altered functional connectivity and recovery in TBI using optogenetic fMRI.

Cataract surgery is one of the largest expenses in the annual Medicare healthcare costs in the U.S. Cataracts are better known for affecting older people, but non-syndromic congenital cataracts occur at an early age and cause a significant visual impairment. Genetic and environmental factors have been found to play an important part in age-related cataracts. Crystallins are highly abundant proteins of the eye lens, and mutations in crystallins genes have been shown to be the cause of many inherited cataracts. Hereditary cataracts show clinically and genetically heterogeneous lens pathology, and the relationships between cataract etiology, morphology and underlying biochemical and cell biological mechanisms remain unclear. This project will address unanswered questions to understand the molecular mechanism for cataracts caused by two different mutations in alpha crystallin genes that cause human cataracts.

Surgery on small, diagnosed AAAs is risky and provides no benefit; no other established non-surgical treatments are available to stop or reverse small AAA growth. Recent studies have shown that oral dosing of a drug, doxycycline (DOX), inhibits enzymes that breakdown the structural components of the aortic wall thus slowing vessel expansion. However, this mode of delivery causes several body-wide side effects and inhibits the already poor potential of cells in the diseased aorta wall to replace disrupted elastic fibers, the structures that allow the vessel to stretch and recoil. In this study, we are investigating a minimally invasive approach to reverse small AAA growth that involves use of small, nano-sized biodegradable polymer particles for sustained and local delivery of DOX within the AAA wall tissue. The DOX release from these particles will be a small fraction of the oral dose, and one at which the drug will both prevents elastic fiber breakdown and also simultaneously stimulate new fiber formation by diseased vascular cells. Our particles are also designed such as to add on to these effects due to the released drug. This treatment approach can potentially restore healthy vessel structure in high risk older patients diagnosed with small AAAs, without need for surgically intervene.",7643797; ,"RAMAMURTHI, ANAND ;","LUNDBERG, MARTHA",12/15/2017,11/30/2021,abdominal aorta; Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm; acyl group; Adult; Adverse effects; Anabolism; Animal Model; Aorta; Aortic Diseases; Apoptosis; Attenuated; biodegradable polymer; Biodistribution; Biomimetics; Caliber; Catheters; Cations; Cell Culture Techniques; Cells; Charge; Chronic; Clinical Trials; Collagen Fiber; crosslink; Data; density; design; Diagnosis; Dose; Doxycycline; Elastic Fiber; Elastin; Elderly; Enzymes; Etiology; Event; Extracellular Matrix; Fiber; flexibility; Formulation; Future; Glycolates; Growth; high risk; Homeostasis; Hydrophobicity; Image; Infusion procedures; inhibitor/antagonist; injured; iron oxide; Link; Literature; Magnetism; male; MAPK8 gene; Mediating; Messenger RNA; Metalloproteases; minimally invasive; MMP2 gene; Modeling; Muscle Cells; nanoparticle; nanosized; nanotherapeutic; nanotherapy; older patient; Operative Surgical Procedures; Oral; Outcome; overexpression; particle; Patient risk; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Polymers; pre-clinical; prevent; Property; prospective; Protein Isoforms; Rattus; regenerative; repaired; restoration; Rupture; Safety; Severities; Signal Transduction; Smoker; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; SP600125; Stimulus; stress activated protein kinase; Stretching; Structure; Surface; synergism; System; Testing; Time; Tissues; Transforming Growth Factors; Treatment Efficacy; uptake; Vascular Diseases; Vascular Smooth Muscle; ,Matrix Regenerative Nanotherapeutics for Small Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair,139662,NANO,Nanotechnology Study Section ,,,1,250000,151042,401042,

Our device will be significantly more robust and tunable using peptides as the deriviatization layer for chemical class differentiation. Furthermore, data collection of the temporal response profile promises high sensitivity because the derivatization layer can be tailored with the large diversity of peptide sequences. In addition, a vapor tracking device would allow for long-term exposure history tracking; whereby a highly non-intrusive, compact breath collection device could be used to monitor VOC biomarkers, and potentially analyze onset as a first level of screening- i.e. signifying the need to visit a physician for further testing. The ability to monitor health status through non-invasive breath monitoring would be significant, as the breath is rich with physiological markers of both invasive type disease as well as acute infection from foreign pathogens.

In bacteria, yeast, and plants, potassium ion uptake is achieved by a superfamily of potassium ion transporters, the SKT proteins, which has more than 6000 members identified to date. Since the SKT family of proteins is not found in humans or other animals, these proteins are potential targets for antibiotics or fungicides. Work proposed in this application will lead us to a better understanding of basic mechanisms of how this large and diverse family selects and conducts ions, and how ion conduction is regulated by intracellular ATP and ADP concentrations; this knowledge will provide a solid foundation for developing small- molecule inhibitors specific to SKT proteins from major pathogens, which could be used as lead compounds for drugs targeting these proteins.",6711104; ,"ZHOU, MING ;","OH, YOUNGSUK",3/15/2006,11/30/2018,Affect; Affinity; Animals; Antibiotics; Architecture; Bacteria; base; Binding; Binding Sites; Cations; cell growth; Cells; Complex; crosslink; Crystallization; Cysteine; Drug Targeting; Equilibrium; Escherichia coli; experimental study; Family; Family member; Foundations; fungus; Gated Ion Channel; Goals; Growth; Homeostasis; Human; Industrial fungicide; Ion Channel Gating; Ions; Knowledge; Lead; Life; Ligands; Measures; Mediating; member; Membrane Proteins; Molecular Conformation; Monovalent Cations; Motion; Na(+)-K(+)-Exchanging ATPase; Nucleotides; operation; pathogen; Pathway interactions; Physiological Processes; Physiology; Plants; Play; Positioning Attribute; Potassium Channel; potassium ion; preference; Protein Family; Proteins; public health relevance; Resolution; Roentgen Rays; Role; single molecule; small molecule inhibitor; Solid; Structure; Testing; Time; uptake; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; virtual; Work; Yeasts; ,Mechanism of Gating and Permeation in The TRKH K+ Channels,86392,BPNS,Biophysics of Neural Systems Study Section ,,,9,236271,138218,374489,

No medical treatments seem effective. We have found evidence that autoimmunity appears to be involved in IPF, in which the patient's own immune system attacks the lung. We believe the experimental treatment of this trial that targets this autoimmune process will ultimately be shown to be effective therapy for these patients.

Based on studies of underlying mechanisms, we propose to improve the heart function of patients with this mitral condition caused by heart attack by treating the heart muscle as well as the valve, and by treating both the contracting heart cells and their surrounding scar-forming cells together in way that may produce the greatest benefit, especially providing early treatment following heart attack to prevent the vicious downhill cycle to heart failure in a large number of patients.

We also found that sorting the animal's cortical sensory responses and behavioral choices by arousal state (as measured by pupil diameter) revealed an inverted U, with optimal responses and performance occurring at intermediate levels of arousal. Here we will address the cellular, network, and neuromodulatory mechanisms underlying the determination of optimal state for neural and behavioral performance. We hypothesize that neuromodulatory transmitter systems are in constant flux and that these fluctuations in release cause ongoing and influential changes in the operating properties of the cerebral cortex. We will use a variety of state-of-the-art techniques, including whole cell recording, two-photon imaging, and optogenetics, to reveal the precise cellular, network, and neuromodulatory mechanisms underlying rapid state control in awake, behaving mice.

For instance, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is used to treat patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who have an unacceptable surgical risk, or in whom there are technical concerns such as the presence of a porcelain aorta. Percutaneous pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) has proven highly effective for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who fail to respond adequately to medical therapy. There has been extraordinary growth in the utilization of these minimally invasive procedures over the last few years, driven by compelling evidence of improved patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness.  The use of pre-procedural CT angiography (CTA) and contrast-enhanced MRA (CEMRA) provides critical planning information that is essential for optimal patient outcomes. However, most patients undergoing TAVR or PVI are elderly, and many suffer from multi-system vascular disorders or other co-morbidities. The high incidence of renal dysfunction in these patients raises serious concerns for giving contrast agents. The overall goals of this project are to develop and validate robust, <20-minute MRI strategies for pre-procedural high- resolution imaging of the great vessels, free from the need for contrast agents or ECG gating.

We have found that the function of BK channels is abnormal in diabetic coronary arteries. The goal of this project is to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes. We hypothesize that BK channels in diabetes are abnormal as a result of suppressed expression of Nrf2, a critical factor that normally keeps the damaging effects of excess oxidation under control. We will determine the effects of diabetes on Nrf2 expression and on BK channel function and degradation. We will design strategies to activate Nrf2 activities to restore BK channel function and normal blood vessel activities.
