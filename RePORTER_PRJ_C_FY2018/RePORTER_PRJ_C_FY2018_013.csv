Project Narrative Reactive aggression (RA) represents a transdiagnostic indicator that permeates nearly all psychiatric disorders in youth and is one of the most common reasons youth are referred for mental health treatment. The persistence of RA during the transition to adolescence marks significant risk for a range of mental health disorders in adulthood, including antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder, and it is linked to increased risk for suicide and substance use as well as lower academic achievement, poor interpersonal functioning and higher rates of incarceration. The present study seeks to examine emotional reactivity and parenting dimensions as risk factors for the persistence of RA during the transition to adolescence in order to better identify who is most vulnerable and how to best intervene with those youth and their families.","14084590; ","BYRD, AMY L.;","SARAMPOTE, CHRISTOPHER S","09/30/2016","07/27/2018","Academic achievement; Address; Adolescence; Adult; Age; Aggressive behavior; Alcohol or Other Drugs use; Antisocial Personality Disorder; Behavior; Behavior Control; Behavioral; Biological Factors; biopsychosocial; Borderline Personality Disorder; Child; Child Rearing; Childhood; Clinical; Conflict (Psychology); Development; Developmental Process; Dimensions; Disease; Ecological momentary assessment; Emotional; Emotions; Environmental Risk Factor; experience; Failure; Family; follow up assessment; Frustration; Goals; Heterogeneity; high risk; Imprisonment; indexing; Individual; Individual Differences; infancy; innovation; Intervention; Knowledge; Laboratories; Life; Light; Link; Measurement; Measures; Mental disorders; Mental Health; Modality; Moods; Motivation; National Institute of Mental Health; Nature; Neurobiology; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Phenotype; Plant Roots; Prevalence; Preventive Intervention; Problem behavior; Problem Solving; Process; prospective; Psychopathology; Psychophysiology; Public Health; Reporting; Research; Research Domain Criteria; Research Training; response; Rewards; Risk; Risk Factors; Sampling; scaffold; suicidal risk; Testing; Time; tool; Training; Transact; Translating; Translational Research; Validation; Variant; Withdrawal; Work; Youth; ","Risk for Reactive Aggression into Adolescence: Emotional Reactivity and Parenting","110077","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","48136","","48136",""

We will validate the assay in a CLIA-certified clinical laboratory and deploy it at field stes for use in clinical diagnosis and public health surveillance in patients with unknown febrile illnesses, including acute hemorrhagic fever.","8667619; ","CHIU, CHARLES YEN;","BROWN, LILIANA L","12/09/2015","11/30/2020","Acute; Africa; American; Applications Grants; Babesia microti; Babesiosis; Bioinformatics; Biological Assay; California; Central America; Characteristics; Chikungunya virus; CLIA certified; Clinical; clinical Diagnosis; Clinical Medicine; clinically relevant; cloud based; Cloud Computing; Computer software; Data; data acquisition; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Dengue Virus; Detection; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; diagnostic assay; Differential Diagnosis; Disease Outbreaks; Ebola virus; Enterovirus 68; Etiology; Falciparum Malaria; Fever; Generations; Geography; Goals; Hantavirus; High Performance Computing; Hour; Human; improved; Influenza; influenzavirus; instrument; instrumentation; Laboratories; laptop; Lassa virus; Libraries; Ligation; Medical; Metagenomics; Methods; microbial; nanopore; next generation sequencing; novel; Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests; pathogen; Pathogen detection; Patients; Performance; Phase; Plasma; point of care; Population Surveillance; portability; Preparation; Procedures; Public Health; public health relevance; Puerto Rico; rapid detection; rapid diagnosis; Red Cross; Reproducibility; respiratory; Salmonella typhi; Sampling; screening; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sequence Analysis; Site; Specificity; Symptoms; Technology; Testing; Time; Typhoid Fever; usability; Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers; Whole Blood; ","Real-Time Unbiased Pathogen Detection in Febrile Illnesses by Nanopore Sequencing","120977","ZAI1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","300000","117000","417000",""

This release of ATP does not require cell damage and occurs through multiple mechanisms, including ion channels. We recently found that Pannexin1 (Panx1) channels mediate the release of ATP that prolongs status epilepticus. A major question that remains to be answered, however, regards whether astrocytes or neurons are the cells that contribute to Panx1-mediated seizures. Thus, the goals of this project are to determine the extent to which astrocyte and neuronal Panx1 contribute to status epilepticus by releasing ATP and to characterize the biophysical properties and signal transduction events mediating pannexin1 channel activation in solitary astrocytes and cultured neurons. These studies are expected to provide new insights for therapeutic intervention in diseases involving the activation of Pannexin1 channels, such as has been reported to occur in seizures","2091199 (contact); 1878895; ","SCEMES, ELIANA  (contact); VELISKOVA, JANA ;","WHITTEMORE, VICKY R","11/11/2017","03/31/2020","","'Importance of Pannexin to Astrocyte and Neuronal ATP'","092786","NTRC","Neurotransporters, Receptors, and Calcium Signaling Study Section ","","","03","126120","80717","206837",""

The current application will focus only on type 2 diabetes. The Framingham Heart Study revealed that the risk of heart failure is up to 5 times higher in diabetics than non-diabetics, when controlling for other risk factors. Diastolic dysfunction is an early functional abnormality of the heart in DM and we have previously reported that 23-54% of DM patients have preclinical diastolic dysfunction (PDD) or Stage B heart failure. Diabetic patients with PDD have a 5-year mortality rate of 30.8% compared to 12.1% for diabetic patients with no diastolic dysfunction. While the current therapies for DM are effective in lowering blood glucose, there is, currently, no proven therapy to prevent or regress the development of PDD in DM (stage B HF) so as to enhance or preserve cardiac function and prevent the development of symptomatic (stage C) HF. The impact of our proposed studies is high, as they will advance our knowledge of the integrated cardiorenal and humoral physiology in patients with type 2 DM and PDD and test novel therapeutic strategies to prevent the progression to symptomatic heart failure (Stage C heart failure).","6533150; ","CHEN, HORNG H;","DESVIGNE-NICKENS, PATRICE","09/01/2017","08/31/2021","Acute; Address; Age; American; Angiotensin Receptor; Animals; Attenuated; base; Biological; Biological Preservation; Biological Response Modifier Therapy; Biology; Blood Glucose; Blood Vessels; Body mass index; Brain natriuretic peptide; Cardiac; cardiogenesis; Cause of Death; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Cleaved cell; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Data; Clinical Sciences; Coronary heart disease; Cyclic GMP; Data; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetes mellitus therapy; diabetic cardiomyopathy; diabetic patient; disorder prevention; Down-Regulation; Experimental Models; Framingham Heart Study; Functional disorder; Funding; Generations; Guanosine; Heart Abnormalities; Heart failure; Human; Hydrophobicity; Hyperglycemia; Hypertension; Impairment; improved; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; insight; Insulin; insulin secretion; Kidney; Knowledge; Laboratory Research; Left; Metalloproteases; Molecular; mortality; Myocardial; Natriuretic Peptides; Neprilysin; Nitric Oxide; non-diabetic; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; novel therapeutics; patient population; Patients; peptide hormone; Peptide Receptor; Peptides; Periodicity; Phenotype; Physiological; Physiology; Play; Population; pre-clinical; preclinical study; prevent; Probability; Process; Property; Proteins; Renal function; Reporting; Research; response; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Saline; Second Messenger Systems; sex; Side; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; System; Systolic heart failure; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; Time; tool; Translational Research; United States National Institutes of Health; Ventricular; Zinc; ","Preclinical Diastolic Dysfunction in Type 2 Diabetes","136440","CICS","Clinical and Integrative Cardiovascular Sciences Study Section ","","A1","01","441012","252331","693343",""

ESCoNS was founded and held its first highly successful meeting on September 19-20, 2011 at the UCSF Mission Bay Conference Center in San Francisco, CA. It attracted 221 attendees: cognitive and clinical scientists, clinicians, officials from the National Institute of Health and the Department of Defense, leaders of the videogame industry and the scientific media. In 21 talks given by world-leading scientists, two panel discussions, and over 50 scientific poster presentations, the consensus emerged that we now have the knowledge base to combine the neuroscience of brain plasticity and cognitive training with entertainment and interactive software technology to target brain dysfunction in a number of human illnesses, creating an innovative field of 'cognitive neurotherapeutics.' The purpose of ESCoNS 2 (and of ongoing ESCoNS meetings) is to leverage the expertise of scientific and software specialists for the design of these new approaches to cognitive training, as well as to surmount barriers in collaborative efforts and intervention implementation. Specific Aim 1: Speakers from the scientific community will address emerging knowledge on mechanisms of experience-dependent neuroplasticity and its alterations in neuropsychiatric disease, neurodegenerative disease, and normal aging; specialists in interactive and entertainment software from both academia and industry will share their knowledge of their craft and its potential applications to address impaired neural system functioning. The overall objective is to create a powerful and highly productive two-way communication between these groups - experts who do not normally have a venue for professional interaction. Specific Aim 2: As a secondary aim, the ESCoNS Organizing Committee will make a targeted effort to include women and underrepresented minorities in this emerging collaboration, through widespread invitations to junior participants and attendees, including undergraduate and graduate students who will be the next generation to carry this field forward.","1893336; ","VINOGRADOV, SOPHIA ;","CHEN, DAOFEN","03/01/2013","07/31/2016","Academia; Address; Aging; Applications Grants; Arts; Brain; brain dysfunction; California; Clinical; Cognitive; Cognitive Science; cognitive training; Collaborations; Communication; Communities; Computer software; computerized; Consensus; Department of Defense; design; Development; Ensure; Event; experience; Faculty; Family; Foundations; Functional disorder; Funding; Goals; graduate student; Grant; Heart; Human; Industry; industry partner; innovation; interest; Intervention; Knowledge; knowledge base; Laboratories; Los Angeles; meetings; member; Mental disorders; Mission; nervous system disorder; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurology; Neuronal Plasticity; neuropsychiatric disorder; Neurosciences; next generation; Nonprofit Organizations; normal aging; novel strategies; Oral; Participant; posters; professor; programs; Psychiatry; Public Policy; relating to nervous system; Research; Research Personnel; Rosa; San Francisco; Schools; Science; Scientist; Seeds; Series; social; Societies; software development; Specialist; student participation; symposium; System; Technology; Therapeutic; tool; Translating; undergraduate student; Underrepresented Minority; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Woman; ","Entertainment Software and Neurotherapeutics Society (ESCoNS) Conferences","083275","NSD","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Initial Review Group ","","","04","15000","0","15000",""

A corollary of this reasoning is that we can use this understanding to define how genetic polymorphisms that increase risk to develop complex diseases and are localized in the non-coding portion of the genome actually regulate gene expression and contribute to disease risk.","8329099; ","AUNE, THOMAS M.;","KELLY, HALONNA R","07/15/2000","11/30/2019","Address; Affect; Area; arm; Binding; Biological Models; Biology; Capital; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cell Lineage; Cells; Chromosomes; Code; Complex; cytokine; Cytokine Gene; Development; Disease; disorder risk; Distal; Distal Enhancer Elements; Elements; Enhancers; Epigenetic Process; Evolution; experimental study; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profile; Gene Expression Regulation; gene repression; Gene Silencing; Genes; Genetic Polymorphism; Genetic Risk; Genetic Transcription; Genome; genome wide association study; Genomic Segment; Genomics; Goals; GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs; Haplotypes; Human; Human Genome; IL4 gene; Immune system; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Inherited; Interferon Type II; Interferon-alpha; Interleukin-13; Letters; Link; Memory; Molecular Conformation; Molecular Profiling; mouse genome; mouse model; Natural Killer Cells; Nuclear; Pathogenesis; Pattern; Play; Population; Proteins; public health relevance; Reading; Regulation; Regulatory Element; Repression; response; Risk; risk variant; RNA; Role; Series; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Stimulus; symposium; T cell differentiation; T memory cell; T-Lymphocyte; Terminator Codon; Testing; Transcript; Untranslated RNA; Writing; ","IFN-Gamma Gene Regulation in T Cells and NK Cells","044924","CMIA","Cellular and Molecular Immunology - A Study Section ","","","18","250000","145000","395000",""

The key initial step for the formation of a translocation is a break in the DNA that is eventually repaired improperly. In tumors of the blood and lymph nodes, DNA breaks are frequently caused by an endogenous enzyme called AID. In contrast, the mechanisms that initiate translocations in solid cancers, such as lung and breast cancer, are poorly understood. Our hypothesis is that a group of enzymes called APOBEC, that are closely related to AID, could be responsible for the generation of DNA breaks that initiate translocations in solid tumors. We will test this hypothesis by experiments in cells and mice by which we will understand the mechanistic role of APOBEC enzymes in translocation formation.","10438054; ","CHIARLE, ROBERTO ;","WITKIN, KEREN L","12/18/2017","11/30/2022","Address; apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme; base; Biology; Blood; cancer cell; cancer therapy; cancer type; Cell Nucleus; Cell Therapy; cell type; Cells; Chromosomal translocation; Chromosome Fragile Sites; Cytidine Deaminase; density; DNA; DNA biosynthesis; DNA Damage; DNA Double Strand Break; DNA Repair Pathway; DNA Sequence Rearrangement; DNA Structure; Double Strand Break Repair; Down-Regulation; enzyme activity; Enzymes; Event; Evolution; experimental study; Family; Frequencies; Generations; Genes; Genome; genome-wide; Genomic Instability; Genomics; Hematologic Neoplasms; Human; human data; Immunoglobulin Class Switching; Immunoglobulin Gene Rearrangement; Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation; Immunoglobulin Switch Recombination; in vitro Assay; in vivo; in vivo Model; Induced Mutation; Inflammation; innovation; insight; Intrinsic factor; Ionizing radiation; Lead; leukemia/lymphoma; Link; lymph nodes; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; malignant stomach neoplasm; Maps; member; Methods; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; Normal Cell; Nuclear; Oncogenic; Pathologic; Pattern; Physiological; polypeptide; Positioning Attribute; Probability; Proteins; Reactive Oxygen Species; Recurrence; repaired; Research; response; Role; Signal Transduction; Solid; Solid Neoplasm; Somatic Mutation; Specificity; Stress; Structure; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; tool; Topoisomerase II; tumor; ultraviolet irradiation; Ultraviolet Rays; Up-Regulation; V(D)J Recombination; ","APOBEC proteins as drivers of chromosomal translocations in solid cancers","222598","CG","Cancer Genetics Study Section ","","","01","228750","176138","404888",""

Although research in mice has led to most of the fundamental insights into the development and function of the mammalian immune system, restoration of self-tolerance has been relatively easy to achieve in mouse models of autoimmune disease and many of these findings have been difficult to translate into effective therapies for human autoimmunity. The goal of this proposal is to use novel and realistic mouse models that more closely mirror human immune function to study tolerance induction via manipulation of the IL-2/regulatory T cell axis, and identify critical parameters that influence the outcome of therapies aimed at preventing or ameliorating autoimmune disease.","7974078 (contact); 1938696; 1857806; ","CAMPBELL, DANIEL J (contact); GAVIN, MARC A; ZIEGLER, STEVEN F;","ROTHERMEL, ANNETTE L","12/20/2017","11/30/2022","Acute; Address; Alopecia Areata; American; Animal Model; Antigens; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmune Process; Autoimmunity; Biology; CD34 gene; Cell physiology; Cells; Chronic; Crohn's disease; Daclizumab; Development; Disease; disorder prevention; drug development; effective therapy; Effector Cell; Environment; Environmental Exposure; Experimental Genetics; FOXP3 gene; Functional disorder; Generations; genetic manipulation; Genetic Polymorphism; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Goals; Growth Factor; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Human; humanized mouse; IL2 Signaling Pathway; IL2RA gene; Immune; immune function; Immune system; Immune System Diseases; Immune Tolerance; Immunogenetics; Immunology; immunopathology; immunoreaction; Immunotherapy; Incidence; Infection; insight; Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Interleukin 2 Receptor; Interleukin-2; Laboratory mice; Maintenance; Modeling; Molecular; Monitor; Monoclonal Antibodies; mouse model; Multiple Sclerosis; Mus; Natural Immunity; novel; pathogen; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Phenotype; Physiological; prevent; Public Health; receptor; Receptor Signaling; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Institute; Research Personnel; Resources; response; restoration; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Role; Self Tolerance; System; T-Lymphocyte; Therapeutic; therapy outcome; Tissues; Translating; translational study; Universities; Vaccination; Vitiligo; Washington; Work; ","Targeting the IL-2/regulatory T cell axis for autoimmune disease prevention in realistic animal models","136475","TTT","Transplantation, Tolerance, and Tumor Immunology ","","","01","399567","279697","679264",""

This lack of clarity manifests in the fact that current treatment do not cure these diseases.

Type 1 regulatory T cells are able to suppress these T helper responses that lead to lung inflammation, but we do not understand the molecular basis for how these cells develop, or what pathways control their function. This work will examine a signaling pathway that is pharmaceutically tractable, to determine its role in the development and function of Type 1 regulatory T cells, and may suggest methods to better control lung inflammation by these cells.","1921631 (contact); 12530398; ","AUGUST, AVERY  (contact); HUANG, WEISHAN ;","DAVIDSON, WENDY F","12/22/2017","11/30/2019","Affect; airway hyperresponsiveness; allergic airway inflammation; American; base; Cell Differentiation process; Cell physiology; Cells; Country; cytokine; Data; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Development; Disease; Equilibrium; experimental study; Extrinsic asthma; FOXP3 gene; genetic approach; Healthcare Systems; Human; Immune; Immunotherapeutic agent; In Vitro; Inflammatory; inflammatory lung disease; Inflammatory Response; innovation; Interleukin-10; IRF4 gene; Lead; Lung; Lung Inflammation; Mediating; Methods; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; novel; Pathway interactions; Pharmacologic Substance; Play; Population; Production; Protein Tyrosine Kinase; Regulation; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; response; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Symptoms; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Th1 Cells; Transgenic Mice; United States; Work; ","Itk signaling and Type 1 regulatory T cell differentiation and function in allergic airway inflammation","129422","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","125000","70521","195521",""

In addition to aspirin, current medication for thrombosis prevention/treatment mainly focus on platelet P2Y12 receptor with plavix as an antagonist in routine clinical use. However, plavix has showed unstable performance, either failing to avoid thrombosis or causing bleeding. The long-term goal of this project is to establish non-platelet P2Y receptors, e.g. P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R), as a new molecular target that controls inflammation-induced vascular thrombogenesis. Although it is well established that tissue factor (TF) is the initiator of thrombosis, very little is known on the contribution of P2Y receptors in regulation of various inflammatory stimuli-induced TF expressions. This is an important question because many pro-inflammatory stimuli promote cellular nucleotide release and inactivate ectonucleotidases, leading to accumulation of extracellular nucleotides, which in turn amplify original receptors' signaling via P2Y receptor co-activation. The PI reported previously that P2Y2R is up-regulated in stented coronary arteries and it is the predominant subtype of all P2Y receptors in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC). They also reported that activation of P2Y2R dramatically induces TF expression and activity in HCAEC. The PIs' preliminary studies showed that TF induction by P2Y2R is also applicable to human primary blood monocytes and mouse coronary endothelium in vivo, and it involves both transcriptional and post- transcriptional mechanisms. Further, LPS-induced TF induction is significantly decreased when extracellular nucleotides are removed by apyrase, and importantly, P2Y2R-null mice are protected from endotoxic death. Based on these original findings, the PI proposes the hypothesis: The non-platelet P2Y2R is a previously unrecognized key mediator in inflammation-induced thrombosis via TF induction. This hypothesis will be tested by the pursuit of three specific aims: 1) Determine the transcriptional mechanism underlying P2Y2R activation of the TF gene in vascular endothelial cells and blood monocytes; 2) Define the post-transcriptional mechanism by which P2Y2R activation leads to increased TF mRNA stability in vascular endothelial cells and blood monocytes; 3) Assess the role of P2Y2R/TF axis in mouse models of inflammation-induced thrombosis. Aim 1 will determine the role of a new AP-1 binding site with new AP-1 components Fra-1/ATF2 in TF mRNA induction by P2Y2R. Aim 2 will determine the roles of the AU-rich elements in TF 3'UTR along with their binding proteins and the miRNA mechanisms contribute to P2Y2R-mediated TF mRNA stabilization. Aim 3 will verify if deletion of P2Y2R prevents LPS-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation and reduces atherothrombosis. The proposed study will be performed in primary cultured human cells and cells isolated from P2Y2R-null mice, followed by a series of in vivo studies. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance and expand understanding of how inflammation leads to increased thrombogenicity of blood vessels via the new P2Y2R-TF axis. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to produce new strategies in combating thrombogenic diseases.","10174030; ","SHEN, JIANZHONG ;","OCHOCINSKA, MARGARET J","01/01/2017","11/30/2021","3' Untranslated Regions; Acute; Address; Affect; Apyrase; Arterial Fatty Streak; Aspirin; ATF2 gene; atherothrombosis; base; Binding; Binding Proteins; Binding Sites; Biological Assay; Blood coagulation; Blood flow; Blood Platelets; Blood Vessels; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cause of Death; Cell Line; cell type; Cells; Cessation of life; Chronic; Clinical; clopidogrel; combat; Complication; Coronary; Coronary artery; CYP2C19 gene; cytokine; Disease; Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation; Drug Targeting; Elements; EMSA; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium; Expenditure; extracellular; Family; ferric chloride; Fos-Related Antigens; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic Polymorphism; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Growth Factor; Healthcare; Hemorrhage; Hormones; Human; in vivo; Infiltration; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; LDL-Receptor Related Protein 1; Leukocytes; Link; liver injury; Luciferases; MAPK14 gene; MAPK8 gene; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; member; Messenger RNA; MicroRNAs; MK-2; Modeling; Molecular Target; Monitor; monocyte; mouse model; mRNA Stability; mRNA Transcript Degradation; Mus; Myocardial Infarction; Necrosis; new therapeutic target; Northern Blotting; novel; Nucleotidases; nucleotide receptor; Nucleotides; P2Y2 receptor; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Performance; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phosphotransferases; Platelet Factor 4; Plavix; Population; Post-Transcriptional Regulation; prevent; Prevention; Process; Prophylactic treatment; receptor; Receptor Activation; Receptor Signaling; Regulation; Reporting; Research; Resistance; response; rho; Role; Sepsis; Series; Site; Solid; Source; Stents; Stimulus; stroke; Testing; Therapeutic Agents; Thromboplastin; Thrombosis; Time; Time Factors; transcription factor; Transcription Factor AP-1; United States; Up-Regulation; Vascular Endothelial Cell; vascular inflammation; Western Blotting; Wild Type Mouse; ","Non-platelet P2Y Receptor in Vascular Inflammation and Thrombogenesis","125279","AICS","Atherosclerosis and Inflammation of the Cardiovascular System Study Section ","","","02","245000","117600","362600",""

Currently, treatments targeting these cells in arteriogenesis are hampered by the fact that overactivation of these cells can lead to adverse outcomes.

We will use innovative genetic, biochemical, and live imaging approaches to define how TRPML1 is activated by virus and its role in budding.

We hypothesize that part of the reason that breathing problems are common in Pompe disease is that brainstem neurons and spinal cord motoneurons fail to adequately control the respiratory muscles.

Work conducted at the UCSD SRP Center is dedicated towards understanding the mechanisms associated with toxicant-induced steatohepatitis (TASH) and cancer, which may be an escalating problem in many susceptible Hispanic and American Indian communities that are exposed to household, occupational and industrial chemical exposure. Our efforts will provide important findings linking mechanisms of TASH and cancer with disease prognosis, which can be communicated to impacted communities to serve as intervention tools to assist in prevention of toxicant exposure.","1861157; ","TUKEY, ROBERT H;","HEACOCK, MICHELLE","07/01/2000","03/31/2020","3D Print; Address; Adult; Affect; African American; American Indians; Animals; Awareness; B-Lymphocytes; Basic Science; Bioinformatics; biomarker identification; Bioremediations; Blood Vessels; California; caucasian American; Cell model; Chemical Exposure; Chemicals; Child; Childhood; Cirrhosis; Clinical; Clinical Research; Cohort Studies; Collaborations; Communication; Communities; Consumption; cost effective; Coupled; demographics; design; Detection; Development; diabetic; Diet; Disadvantaged; Disease; disease registry; Ecology; Educational workshop; Engineering; Environment; Environmental Engineering technology; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Environmental Impact; Epidemic; Evolution; Exposure to; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Fatty Liver; Food; Genetic; Genomics; Geographic Information Systems; Government Agencies; Hazardous Substances; Hazardous Waste Sites; Health; health disparity; Health Hazards; Hepatic; High Fat Diet; high risk; Hispanic Americans; Hispanics; Household; Human; human disease; improved; Incidence; Individual; Industrialization; Industry; innovation; Intervention; Intestines; Knowledge; Lead; Link; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver diseases; Liver Fibrosis; Malignant neoplasm of liver; Malignant Neoplasms; Metabolic; Metabolic syndrome; metabolomics; Methods; Mexico; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; neighborhood disadvantage; Neighborhoods; non-alcoholic fatty liver; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; novel; nutrition; Obesity; Occupational; Outcome; outcome forecast; Pathologic; Pathology; Phenotype; Plant Model; Plants; Poisons; Policies; Population; Poverty; practical application; Prevention; Primary carcinoma of the liver cells; Production; programs; Publications; Reaction; remediation; Research; Research Support; Resources; Risk; Role; Science; Services; Signal Recognition Particle; social media; Soil; statistics; Steatohepatitis; Structure; Superfund; superfund site; T-Lymphocyte; Technology; tissue culture; Tissues; tool; Toxic Environmental Substances; toxicant; Toxicant exposure; Transgenic Plants; Translating; Translational Research; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency; user-friendly; Water; Work; ","DETECTION AND MODELS OF TOXICANT EXPOSURE","010337","ZES1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","16","32258","17742","50000",""

We will target MEK signaling genetically specifically in macrophages or pharmacologically in all cells in in vivo animal models of wound healing and neovascular age-related macular degeneration that show a strong M2-type polarization.

This project will perform tests to determine whether this response to praziquantel is consistent with an attempt by the parasite to evade praziquantel-dependent immune attack.
