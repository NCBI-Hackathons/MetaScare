Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure and myocardial infarction. These common heart diseases exhibit a mismatch between metabolic substrate availability and substrate preference: normal mitochondria prefer fats and proteins that most efficiently make ATP, whereas diseased mitochondria reserve fats and protein to repair heart damage and instead metabolize sugars. It was generally accepted that metabolic transitioning in hearts (from preferring fats to sugars or vice-versa) is simply a matter of genetic programming. However, we discovered that the heart must first rid itself of existing mitochondria before replacing them with those having a metabolic preference matching its condition. We identified the key factors responsible for removal, replacement and redistribution of mitochondria during metabolic transitions. Now, we are developing genetic and pharmacological means by which we can conditionally orchestrate and coordinate activities of these factors to match preferences of the heart's mitochondria to its available metabolic ?menu?. Moreover, by whole genome and exome sequencing we identified rare gene mutations that impair mitochondrial removal and replacement in patients with hypertrophy or heart failure. These studies provide a fresh understanding of cardiac metabolism and establish the foundation for a completely novel approach to managing heart disease by ?dialing in? mitochondrial metabolism to optimize cardiac contraction or repair.",1869126; ,"DORN, GERALD W.;","WONG, RENEE P",1/16/2017,12/31/2023,Adult; base; biochemical tools; Biogenesis; Carbohydrates; Cardiac; Cardiac development; Cardiac Myocytes; Cardiomyopathies; Cells; cohort; Disease; DNA sequencing; Engineering; Excision; Exhibits; exome sequencing; Experimental Models; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Fatty Acids; fetal; fitness; Foundations; Gene Mutation; Genetic; Genetic Programming; genome sequencing; grasp; Growth; Heart; Heart Diseases; Heart failure; Heart Hypertrophy; heart metabolism; Heart Mitochondria; Human; Hypertrophy; Impairment; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; insight; Learning; Mediating; Metabolic; Mitochondria; mitochondrial dysfunction; mitochondrial metabolism; Molecular; mutant; Mutation; Myocardial; Myocardial Infarction; novel; novel strategies; Organ; parkin gene/protein; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peptides; Pharmacology; preference; Process; Production; Proteins; Provider; Reagent; repaired; Research; Role; sugar; Therapeutic; Weight; whole genome; ,THE MITOCHONDRIAL DYNAMISM/FITNESS/BIOGENESIS INTERACTOME IN CARDIAC DISEASE,135736,ZHL1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,2,588000,308700,896700,

Thirty percent of patients with stage I to III disease have silent bone marrow (BM) disseminated tumor cells (DTCs), which increase their likelihood of cancer recurrence as well as complications, such as pathological fractures, and related to the osteolytic nature of the disease. Even patients with limited early-stage disease, who responded well to chemo- or hormonal therapy at the primary site, may relapse years later when dormant bone marrow micro-metastases, previously protected within the bone marrow niche, recrudesce.  Our research has recently revealed that breast cancer bone metastasis in the presence of TGF? in bone , in vitro and in vivo, up-regulated ?v?3-integrin expression, leading to marked diminished sensitivity to systemic chemotherapy. Utilizing this bone BC target, ?v?3-targeted mixed micelles incorporating Sn2 lipase-labile docetaxel prodrug (DTX-PD) (?v?3-DTX-PD MP) were developed and found to rapidly and homogeneously penetrate into BC bone tumors and deliver DTX therapy directly into the cell through a novel approach, termed 'Contact Facilitated Drug Delivery' (CFDD). ?v?3-DTX-PD MP markedly reduced bone marrow BC tumor burden and bone damage with negligible off-target effects, whereas systemic DTX at up to 4-fold higher doses had no impact on tumor progression yet elicited hepatic and hematologic toxicity. Of note, many patients with bone metastasic breast cancer likely will have previously received DTX, so we propose to utilize and test additional non-cross resistant chemotherapies for use in the ?v?3-micelles. From this perspective and recognizing the 'stem cell' nature of breast cancer bone metastases, a camptothecin (CPT) Sn2 lipase-labile prodrug (CPT-PD) has been developed to offer a new patient-naive treatment.  Overall, this project will delineate the efficacy and safety of ?v?3-Sn2-prodrug micelles for BC bone metastases and also elucidate the impact of key bone microstroma constituents such as TGF-? and ?v?3+ tumor associated macrophages (M2 TAMS) and ?v?3+ osteoclasts on treatment responses. The translational overarching goals are to more effectively treat patients with Stage 4 breast cancer in bone (Aims 1& 2), and to increase the enduring cure rate for Stage 1 to 3 BC patients by treating occult breast cancer micro-metastases to diminish disease relapse (Aim 3).",6615994 (contact); 1954055; ,"LANZA, GREGORY M (contact); WEILBAECHER, KATHERINE NELSON;","FU, YALI",1/12/2018,12/31/2022,Address; Adjuvant; anticancer research; Biological; Biological Availability; Biology; Biopsy; bone; Bone Marrow; Bone neoplasms; Bone Pain; Breast; Breast cancer metastasis; Breast Cancer Patient; Breast Cancer Treatment; Camptothecin; Cancer Biology; Cancer Model; Cancer Patient; cancer recurrence; Cancer Relapse; cancer stem cell; cancer subtypes; cell type; Cells; Chemoprotective Agent; chemotherapy; Clinical; clinical investigation; clinically relevant; cytotoxic; Data; Dependence; Development; Disease; docetaxel; Doctor of Philosophy; Dose; dosimetry; Drug Delivery Systems; Effectiveness; Goals; Hepatic; Heterozygote; hormone therapy; Human; hypoxia inducible factor 1; Image; Implant; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Integrin alphaVbeta3; Integrin beta3; Journals; Lifetime Risk; Lipase; macrophage; Malignant Bone Neoplasm; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Mammary Neoplasms; Mastectomy; Medical; Metastatic breast cancer; Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone; Micelles; Micrometastasis; mortality; Mus; nanomedicine; nanosystems; nanotherapy; Nature; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; novel strategies; Oncogenic; Oncologist; oncology; Osteoclasts; Osteolytic; Pathological fracture; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physicians; Prodrugs; programs; Quality of life; Radiosurgery; Recurrent disease; Relapse; relapse risk; Research; Resistance; response; Risk; Safety; Scientist; selective expression; Site; skeletal; spinal cord compression; Stem cells; Stromal Cells; Surveys; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Human Experimentation; Topoisomerase; Toxic effect; Transforming Growth Factor beta; transforming growth factor beta3; treatment response; tumor; Tumor Burden; tumor progression; Up-Regulation; Visceral; Woman; ,OVERCOMING THE PROTECTIVE BARRIERS OF BREAST CANCER IN BONE MARROW WITH TARGETED PRODRUG NANOTHERAPY,216840,NANO,Nanotechnology Study Section ,,A1,1,408499,214462,622961,

We will reveal the molecular basis of this resistance and develop strategies to design novel more robust HCV PIs. One key strategy is to compare inhibitor binding to substrate recognition and avoid functionally unessential contacts that are vulnerable to resistance mutations. The strategies to design potent inhibitors less susceptible to resistance will also be translated to flaviviral proteases such as dengue, where no current DAA or vaccine exists.",1922833; ,"SCHIFFER, CELIA A.;","KOSHY, RAJEN",5/1/2010,12/31/2019,Active Sites; Address; Adopted; Affinity; Antiviral Agents; Aprotinin; Binding; Biological Assay; Biological Process; Caring; Clinic; clinically relevant; Combined Modality Therapy; Complex; Computational Technique; Crystallization; Cyclic Peptides; Dengue; Dengue Virus; design; Development; Disease; Drug Design; Drug resistance; Effectiveness; Endemic Diseases; Enzyme Kinetics; Enzymes; Equilibrium; Event; Evolution; Family; Flavivirus; Foundations; Generations; Genotype; Goals; Hepatitis C; HIV-1 protease; improved; inhibitor/antagonist; Interdisciplinary Study; iterative design; Knowledge; Letters; Life Cycle Stages; Medical; Molecular; molecular dynamics; molecular recognition; Multi-Drug Resistance; mutant; Mutation; nanosecond; novel; Outcome; Patients; Peptide Hydrolases; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase III Clinical Trials; Positioning Attribute; pressure; Probability; Process; Protease Inhibitor; public health relevance; Replicon; Research; Resistance; Resistance development; resistance mutation; Shapes; Site; Structure; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic development; therapeutic target; Translating; Vaccines; Variant; Viral; Viral Proteins; Virus; ,Drug Resistance in HCV NS3/4A - Inhibitor binding versus substrate recognition,85051,DDR,Drug Discovery and Mechanisms of Antimicrobial Resistance Study Section ,,,9,351322,237142,588464,

The worldwide outbreak in 2009 of the novel H1N1 swine like influenza virus infection in the human population highlights the speed with which this virus can spread. One of the most serious consequences of influenza infection is the development of a primary influenza pneumonia. Although infrequent, primary influenza pneumonia has a very high morbidity and mortality rate ? anywhere between 10% to 30% mortality of patients with pneumonia. Pneumonia is caused when the virus infects cells deep in the lungs where oxygen exchange occurs. When a large percentage of these terminal airway cells are infected, this results in the respiratory compromise associated with pneumonia. We have discovered that infection of these terminal airway cells can be suppressed by employing a technique based on how another cell type deep in the lungs, alveolar macrophages, prevent infection of these terminal airway epithelial cells. In a mouse model of influenza infection we have found that similar to the action of alveolar macrophages, we can limit the extent of influenza infection of the terminal airway cells by administering a class of drugs typically use in the treatment of asthma called leukotriene receptor antagonists ? specifically Accolade and Singulair. Our results raise the possibility that individuals infected with influenza can take this class of drugs to prevent the development of influenza pneumonia.

Understanding how neural networks in the hippocampal formation support memory is essential for efforts to restore memory function in disease. The hippocampal formation is critical for the formation and retrieval of autobiographical memory, which is unique in that it contains information about what happened when and where. It is known how objects, context and space (what, where) are represented in the hippocampus and it has recently been described that time (when events occur) on a scale of seconds to minutes is represented by the sequential activation of hippocampal cells. However, a neural code for when an episode occurred over periods of hours or days has not been described, even though humans and other animal species can remember how long ago an event occurred on this time scale. In recently published results and results presented as preliminary data, we identify a novel hippocampal neural code that represents how long ago an event occurred on a time scale of hours and days. We propose to determine (1) where the neural code for time originates within the hippocampo-entorhinal circuitry, (2) how it is combined with a stable representation for other aspects of memory, and (3) whether a time-varying code in hippocampus is used for remembering 'how long ago'. Defining how different cell populations contribute to coding for different aspects of autobiographical memories will reveal which aspects of circuit function need to be restored by treatment strategies that restore memory function in disease.",10659006; ,"LEUTGEB, JILL K;","BUHRING, BETTINA D",2/1/2014,12/31/2018,Address; Alzheimer's Disease; Animals; Area; arm; awake; base; Behavior; behavior test; Behavioral; Biological Neural Networks; Brain; Brain region; Cells; Code; Data; Disease; Electrophysiology (science); entorhinal cortex; Environment; Episodic memory; Event; experience; experimental study; Foundations; Functional disorder; Future; Hippocampal Formation; Hippocampus (Brain); Hour; Human; Impairment; Lateral; Lesion; Location; long term memory; Measures; Medial; Memory; Memory Loss; memory process; Mental disorders; nervous system disorder; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurons; novel; Pathology; Patients; Pattern; Population; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; public health relevance; Publishing; Radial; Rattus; relating to nervous system; repaired; Retrieval; Rodent; Schizophrenia; Structure; Temporal Lobe; Temporal Lobe Epilepsy; Testing; Theoretical model; Time; time interval; Traumatic Brain Injury; treatment strategy; Update; ,A neuronal code for extended time in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuitry,100349,LAM,Neurobiology of Learning and Memory Study Section ,,,5,225000,109287,334287,

New technologic advances have enabled us to measure genes and metabolites in the blood that may help us better identify these individuals.

Myocardial metabolism is a major determinant of heart function but the cellular metabolic mechanisms that facilitate CRT response are unknown; therefore, in this study, we propose an early use of CRT for patients with mild HF to prevent disease progression, specifically, we propose to elucidate metabolic mechanisms facilitating CRT and to discover biomarkers that would improve patient selection and prediction of response to cardiac resynchronizaion.

We have discovered a genetic mutation in CREM that is associated with susceptibility to both Entamoeba histolytica colitis as well as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We will test the hypothesis that CREM defends from amebic colitis and IBD by activating the expression of genes that protect or help heal the intestine from injury. The work is important because current therapies are limited for amebic colitis (a cause of child deaths from diarrhea in low income countries) and for IBD (a disease that affects over a million Americans). Understanding how CREM protects will provide new approaches to the treatment of amebic colitis and inflammatory bowel disease.,1878651; ,"PETRI, WILLIAM A;","WALI, TONU M",8/1/1989,12/31/2022,"Adoptive Transfer; Affect; Amebiasis; Amebic colitis; American; Amino Acids; Bangladesh; Birth; Bone Marrow Transplantation; Cells; Cessation of life; Child; Childhood; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10; Clostridium difficile; cohort; Colitis; collaborative environment; Colon; CREM protein; Crohn's disease; CUL2 gene; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic AMP Response Element; Data; design; Diarrhea; Disease; Disease remission; DNA Resequencing; DNA Sequence Alteration; Entamoeba; Entamoeba histolytica; eosinophil; Etiology; experience; experimental study; Foundations; Funding; gastrointestinal epithelium; Gene Expression; Genetic; Genetic Polymorphism; Genetic Transcription; genome wide association study; Genotype; healing; Hereditary Disease; Human; Immune; Individual; Infection; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Inflammatory disease of the intestine; Injury; innovation; Intestines; Investigation; Journals; Killings; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Legal patent; leptin receptor; Linkage Disequilibrium; low income country; Lymphocyte; Marrow; Mediating; Microbiology; microbiome; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Names; Nature; new therapeutic target; novel strategies; Paper; Parasites; Parasitology; Participant; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmacology; Pharmacotherapy; Phenotype; Pneumonia; Potassium Channel; Predisposition; Principal Investigator; Process; Publications; Quantitative Trait Loci; Radiation Tolerance; radiosensitive; Recruitment Activity; repaired; Reporting; Research; Resistance; Risk; risk variant; RNA Splicing; Role; Site; South Asian; Susceptibility Gene; Testing; Tissues; TNF gene; transcription factor; Transcriptional Regulation; Ulcerative Colitis; United States National Institutes of Health; Vaccines; Variant; Work; ",Role of CREM in Amebic Colitis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease,26649,PTHE,Pathogenic Eukaryotes Study Section ,,A1,28,386104,158268,544372,

Additionally, lifetime prevalence rates of alcohol dependence in the United States are estimated at 12.5% (Hasin et al., 2007). The exponential costs, in addition to the high diagnostic rates, makes alcohol use one of the world?s largest risk factors for preventable disease, and solidifies alcohol use as an important target to improve health outcomes.

Overall, approximately 70% of patients present with stage III or IV disease. For patients with laryngeal, hypopharyngeal, and oropharyngeal cancers ? which represent approximately 30,000 of the cases of HNSCC in the United States per year - non-surgical, organ-preservation protocols, using radiation in combination with concurrent cisplatin, are the standard of care. This approach was instituted over 15 years ago, and it has been established that 20-30% of these patients will require salvage treatment for persistent or recurrent disease after failing therapy. Despite this, a method for recognizing who is at greatest risk of failing concurrent chemoradiation at the time of diagnosis does not exist. This project aims to create a prediction model using TP53 mutation, p16/p14ARF expression, and expression of Bcl-family pro-survival molecules for locoregional response to chemoradiation (Specific Aim#1). The association of these markers with cisplatin and radiation treatment will also be evaluated in tumor cells grown in an innovative in vitro primary cell culture model (Specific Aim#2). These studies have direct clinical relevance and are aimed at addressing a major dilemma in head and neck cancer treatment that has not changed substantially for nearly two decades.

Project Narrative  Inaccurate repair of DNA damage is a primary determinant of cellular transformation and carcinogenesis. In recent years, it has been recognized that in addition to progressive accumulation of mutations, cancer cells are also characterized by a high level of chromosomal instability (CIN) which comes in two forms, numerical instability (nCIN) and structural instability (sCIN). Numerical instability constitutes losing or gaining an extra chromosome because of failure of the chromosome separation apparatus (spindle) during cell division. Structural instability refers to different forms of chromosomal aberrations such as deletions, duplications, inversions and translocations. These sCINs arise as a result of improperly repaired DNA double strand break and this grant focuses on developing an assay to better understand double strand break repair. Understanding the mechanisms that govern DNA double strand break repair is paramount to the development of molecular mechanisms that drive tumor formation.",9308889; ,"PETREACA, RUBEN CIPRIAN;","SHARMAN, ANU",1/12/2018,12/31/2019,Address; Affect; Alleles; Back; Biological Assay; cancer cell; carcinogenesis; Cell division; Cells; Centromere; Chromatin; chromatin remodeling; Chromatin Remodeling Factor; Chromosomal Instability; Chromosomal Rearrangement; Chromosome abnormality; chromosome fusion; Chromosomes; deletion library; Deposition; Development; DNA; DNA biosynthesis; DNA Damage; DNA Double Strand Break; DNA Repair; DNA replication fork; Double Strand Break Repair; Euchromatin; Excision; Exogenous Factors; experimental study; Failure; Fission Yeast; Gene Conversion; gene repair; Genes; Genetic; genetic analysis; Genetic Engineering; genetic information; Genetic Recombination; Genetic Screening; Genetic Transcription; Genome; Grant; Heterochromatin; Histone Acetylation; histone acetyltransferase; Histones; Homologous Gene; homologous recombination; Human; interest; Knowledge; Lead; metaplastic cell transformation; Molecular; Molecular Chaperones; mutant; Mutation; neoplastic cell; Nonhomologous DNA End Joining; novel; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Process; RAD52 gene; Repair Complex; repaired; Research; response; Role; S Phase; Testing; tumor; Validation; Work; Yeast Model System; Yeasts; ,Development of a Novel Genetic Assay to Study DNA Double Strand Breaks,223545,ZCA1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,1,50000,27750,77750,

Loss of salivary gland function is a limiting side-effect of numerous drugs, serious consequences of head and neck cancer treatment using radiation therapy, and also a frequent outcome of autoimmune diseases such as Sjgerns syndrome. Our current studies are focused on the identification of key epigenetic changes and to establish their role in modulating salivary gland destruction. We anticipate that elucidating the mechanism of epigenetic-induced salivary gland destruction; will be important to understand the pathology present in Sjgerns syndrome. Furthermore, we will identify the mechanism involved in regulating certain genes that are critical in salivary gland destruction per se. Greater understanding of these events will be important in elucidating new therapies for salivary gland dysfunctions.",7726886; ,"SINGH, BRIJ B;","CHANDER, PREETHI",7/1/2017,7/31/2022,,Epigenetic regulations in Sjogern's syndrome,22765,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,2,237500,124688,362188,
