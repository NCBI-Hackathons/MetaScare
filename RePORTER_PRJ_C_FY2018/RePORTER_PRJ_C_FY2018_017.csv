Young AA men are at less likely to receive mental health treatment than other racial/ethnic groups. However, theory-based studies on screening and LTC among young, urban AA males are lacking.

Communication breakdowns lead to significant limitations in social, academic, vocational, and other valuable developmental outcomes. Individuals with Down syndrome can benefit from visual communication supports, called augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems. Because access to these systems rely on vision rather than sound and speech, it is critical to understand visual processing by individuals with Down syndrome, in order to optimize the design of these visual supports. This project implements eye tracking technologies to evaluate visual processing in Down syndrome, first in a laboratory and then in a natural communication environment. The optimal system design features that emerge from these studies will be examined in a translational study of the influence of design on functional communication outcomes.

However, the gain in nearly 30 years of life expectancy over the last century in the United States and other developed countries, driven in part by reductions in mortality among the elderly, has resulted in changes in disease prevalence that cannot be accounted for by alterations in allele frequency during the same period. This suggests the need to better understand how genes are influenced by the environment without changing the DNA sequence (epigenetics).

Prophylaxis in at-risk infant populations is based on perfusion with the neutralizing monoclonal antibody, Synagis, to establish passive immunity. Several vaccines are in the development pipeline including a number which are based on the F glycoprotein. Immunization with some of the most advanced candidates have failed to meet clinical endpoints. It appears from structural studies that F protein, while a critical target for inducing Synagis-like and other neutralizing antibodies, a large fraction of non-neutralizing antibodies is made in humans infected with RSV. We hypothesize that these non- neutralizing antibodies interfere with the protective activities of neutralizing antibodies.

Although effective antiretroviral therapy has transformed HIV infection from a disease with a dismal prognosis to a manageable chronic disease, persons with chronically suppressed HIV are at a 40% higher risk of myocardial infarction and stroke than uninfected persons. Though much effort has been focused on determining the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis in HIV- infected persons, innovative strategies are needed to adapt the HIV clinical care team to the evolving medical needs of the HIV population, including comprehensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk management. An essential part of employing effective initiatives to incorporate ASCVD primary prevention into HIV care is understanding what models of chronic disease care have worked in the past. In addition, exploring clinic-based strategies that have proven to be effective in reducing ASCVD risk in uninfected persons will provide insight on what strategies will be successful in HIV-infected persons, especially if they customized to fit the skills of the multidisciplinary HIV clinical care team. The overall research objective is to determine optimal models of care for ASCVD primary prevention in HIV-infected persons and to investigate the role of clinical case managers in improving ASCVD preventative care in the HIV clinic setting. The proposed study will employ the innovative approach of telephone-based interventions for the augmentation of in-clinic care to address ASCVD risk reduction in HIV-infected persons, a high-risk group for ASCVD. The aims of the study are to: 1) Determine the association between the single-provider model for HIV care (HIV clinician as primary care provider) and ASCVD risk factor outcomes; 2) Identify experiences and perceptions of HIV-infected persons on current models of non-AIDS associated chronic disease care delivery; 3) assess the impact of telephone-based case manager-administered interventions in improving ASCVD risk factor outcomes among HIV-infected clinic patients. Hayden Bosworth Ph.D, a Professor of Medicine at Duke with over 270 peer review publications in health services research in ASCVD risk management, will be Dr Okeke's primary mentor for the project. The mentoring team will also have two established investigators with appropriate expertise to guide Dr. Okeke's research agenda: Susanna Naggie MD, Associate Professor of Medicine at Duke, a renowned expert in HIV/HCV co-infection and with vast experience in HIV clinical trials; and Melissa Watt Ph.D, an accomplished investigator in mental health and substance abuse among HIV-infected persons with significant expertise in qualitative methods to inform behavioral interventions in this population.

Almost all children will experience RSV infection before they are 2 years of age and a substantial number will develop lung disease severe enough to be hospitalized. Limited treatment options are currently available. A significant gap in developing new therapeutics to treat RSV infections is the lack of animal models that reproduce the infection and disease seen in humans infected by RSV. These new studies propose to use genetic engineering to develop animal models that better reproduce RSV lung disease so enabling the pre-clinical testing of RSV therapeutics aimed at alleviating human lung disease caused by RSV.,2790064; ,"PICKLES, RAYMOND J;","KIM, SONNIE",1/19/2018,12/31/2019,2 year old; airway epithelium; Animal Model; Animals; Antiviral Agents; B-Lymphocytes; base; Biological Assay; Bone Marrow Transplantation; Cells; Child; Communities; cost; Cytopathology; Data; design; Development; Disease; Elderly; Employee Strikes; Epithelial Cells; Epithelium; Exhibits; experience; Foundations; Future; Genetic Engineering; Hamsters; Health; Histologic; histological studies; Human; Human Characteristics; Immune; Immunity; Immunocompromised Host; in vivo; in vivo Model; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Infiltrate; Interferons; Kinetics; Knock-out; Lung; Lung diseases; Lymphocyte; Measures; Mediating; Modeling; Mucous body substance; Mus; Nature; neutrophil; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; Outcome; Outcome Measure; parainfluenza virus; pathogen; Pathologic; Pathology; patient population; permissiveness; Population; pre-clinical; preclinical development; Preclinical Testing; Production; Proteins; Recombinants; research clinical testing; Respiratory physiology; Respiratory syncytial virus; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines; response; STAT2 gene; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic development; Transplant Recipients; Vaccines; Viral; Virus Diseases; Virus Replication; ,Genetically Engineered Hamsters as Small Animal Models for Testing RSV Therapeutics,138247,VIRB,Virology - B Study Section ,,,1,204550,69375,273925,

In particular, biomarkers that monitor disease progression and assess response to treatment can greatly improve clinical intervention and patient outcome. Such biomarkers are increasingly implemented for disease surveillance and monitoring treatment response and are referred to as 'companion diagnostics.' Since changes in cell adhesion and migration are critical to malignant dissemination and metastasis, it is reasonable to expect molecular mechanisms that support tumor cell motility are desirable therapeutic targets and promising indicators of molecular progression of cancer. We have identified Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule (ALCAM) as an important regulator of tumor cell motility and metastasis in both pre-clinical and mechanistic studies. We have demonstrated that ALCAM is a critical contributor to tumor cell metastasis. By analyzing ALCAM in the serum of tumor-bearing animals, we demonstrated that shedding of the extracellular domain of ALCAM corresponds to disease progression and tumor burden. Furthermore, we found significantly elevated ALCAM levels in both the urine and serum of patients with renal (RCC) and bladder (BCa) cancer. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that the proteolytic shedding of ALCAM contributes to disease progression and that 'shed' ALCAM is a biomarker of disease progression, as well as treatment response in urogenital cancers. The value of shed ALCAM as a biomarker is two-fold: 1) It is a mechanistic link to tumor cell migration and, subsequently, able to report on 'invasive' disease rather than merely the presence of cancer, and 2) The non-invasive detection of ALCAM in urine and serum offers longitudinal assessment of treatment response and disease progression. In addition, understanding how proteolytic processing of ALCAM contributes mechanistically to disease progression will reveal therapeutic approaches that can intervene in the malignant dissemination of cancer. We will address the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine the utility of shed ALCAM in monitoring recurrence and therapeutic response in patients with urogenital cancer. ALCAM is shed into adjacent biofluids such as blood and urine where its levels correlate with tumor burden and disease progression. If this biomarker can be used to accurately monitor patients with existing disease and report on the response to therapy, it can be used to guide clinical care in cancer patients. 2. Determine the mechanism by which ALCAM shedding contributes to the metastatic progression of BCa using a structure/function analysis. ALCAM is cleaved by two proteases, ADAM17 and ?-secretase, which results in the release of an extracellular (ECD) and intracellular (ICD) domain, respectively. Preliminary data in our laboratory suggests that these two ALCAM domains independently regulate cell adhesion, migration and survival differently from the intact protein. To elucidate the function of each domain in regards to tumor cell survival and migration, we will express 7 ALCAM constructs lacking the ECD, ICD and/or the transmembrane domain in bladder cancer cell lines and assess tumor cell survival, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. 3. Identify the ADAM-mediated 'sheddome' of invasive BCa. The promiscuity of membrane proteases such as ADAMs and their established participation in tumor cell invasion suggests that identification of the ADAM-mediated 'sheddome' of invasive/metastatic bladder cancer would substantially contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of metastatic progression and provide additional fluid-based prognostic biomarkers that can be validated with cohorts from Aim 1. We will collect surface biotinylated proteins and utilized a targeted proteomics approach to identify those transmembrane proteins targeted by the ADAM family of proteases. Comparison across a panel of non-invasive verses invasive bladder cancer cell lines will identify the surface proteins shed by ADAMs in response to malignant progression.",10519254; ,"ARNOLD, SHANNA ALEXANDRIA;",,10/1/2014,9/30/2019,Activated-Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule; Address; Animals; base; Biological Markers; biomarker development; Bladder; Blood; Cancer cell line; Cancer Etiology; Cancer Patient; Cell Adhesion; cell motility; Cell Survival; Cessation of life; chemotherapy; Cleaved cell; Clinical; clinical biomarkers; clinical care; cohort; companion diagnostics; Data; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease Progression; Dissociation; Excision; extracellular; Extracellular Domain; Family; Future; Health Care Costs; Imaging Techniques; Immunotherapy; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Institution; Integral Membrane Protein; Intervention; Kidney; Knowledge; Laboratories; Link; Liquid substance; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder; Malignant Neoplasms; Managed Care; Mediating; Medical; Membrane; Membrane Proteins; Metastatic to; migration; Molecular; Monitor; Monitoring for Recurrence; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; Non-Invasive Cancer Detection; Operative Surgical Procedures; Patient Monitoring; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Peptide Hydrolases; Pharmaceutical Preparations; pre-clinical; Primary Neoplasm; Prognostic Marker; Progressive Disease; Proteins; Proteolytic Processing; Proteomics; public health relevance; Recurrence; Reporting; response; Sampling; secretase; Serum; Specimen; Structure; Surface; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Toxic effect; Transmembrane Domain; treatment response; tumor; Tumor Burden; Tumor Cell Invasion; Tumor Cell Migration; tumor progression; Urine; Urogenital Cancer; ,ALCAM as a Biomarker of Treatment Response and Progression in Urogenital Cancers,2498,ONCA,Oncology A ,,,4,,,,

Currently, no effective treatment is available. Thus, the study of the mechanisms controlling the synthesis of myelin is essential to identify new paths of intervention.  We and other groups previously characterized an important growth factor that controls the formation of myelin in the nerves. We also recently showed that other proteins, which act as ?biological scissors?, control the activity of this growth factor. In addition we recently demonstrated that these ?scissors? induce the expression of other molecules, called prostaglandins that promote myelin formation and maintenance in the nerves. By using a combination of cell culture techniques and in vivo animal models, we will investigate how prostaglandins participate in myelin maintenance and axonal preservation.

Aptamers can be rapidly synthesized and easily conjugated to various functional agents for different clinical needs. Due to small size, aptamers exhibit capacity for faster cancer-cell binding and deeper tumor-tissue penetration than protein antibodies, rendering them the unique biomaterials for clinical use. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is the most common T-cell lymphoma in children. The lymphoma cells are characterized by expressing CD30 biomarker and ALK oncogene. Current mainstream treatment for the lymphoma is a combined chemotherapy regimen. However, the chemotherapy is not lymphoma cell-selective or oncogene-specific, and thus, has serious adverse side effects in patients. To address these clinical challenges, this study will develop a multifunctional biomaterial through programed self-assembly of aptamer sequences and self-loading of therapeutic drugs. The formed aptamer-complex biomaterials will be able to simultaneously perform targeted chemotherapy, gene therapy, and immunotherapy specific for the lymphoma without side effects. To validate our hypothesis, preclinical study of the aptamer- complex biomaterial for precision therapy of the lymphoma will be conducted. Technically, this study takes advantages of aptamer technology to develop a new multifunctional biomaterial for precision medicine at low cost and minimal labor. Scientifically, this study will prove a novel immunotherapy approach to care the lymphoma by stimulating cellular naïve apoptotic signaling. Clinically, by combination of three different targeted therapeutic mechanisms the aptamer-complex biomaterial will empower therapy efficacy, reduce drug resistance potential of the lymphoma, and also avoid off-target toxicity to normal cells/tissues. Moreover, the developed multifunctional biomaterial approach will provide a universal platform to design precision medicine to treat other cancers.",1961907; ,"ZU, YOULI ;","FU, YALI",1/15/2018,12/31/2022,Address; Adverse effects; Affinity; anaplastic lymphoma kinase; Antibodies; Antibody-drug conjugates; Apoptotic; aptamer; Aptamer Technology; base; Binding; Biocompatible Materials; Biological; Biological Markers; cancer cell; Caring; Cell Death; Cells; Chemicals; chemotherapy; Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure; Child; Clinical; clinical application; Complex; cost; Cultured Cells; Cyclophosphamide; design; Development; Diagnosis; Doxorubicin; Drug Delivery Systems; drug development; Drug Kinetics; Drug resistance; Drug Targeting; Exhibits; FDA approved; Feasibility Studies; Formulation; gene therapy; Genes; Hydroxyl Radical; Immunotherapeutic agent; Immunotherapy; improved; interest; Ki-1 Large-Cell Lymphoma; Killings; kinase inhibitor; Ligands; Lymphoma; Mainstreaming; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Modality; Molecular; Molecular Conformation; mouse model; Mus; Normal Cell; Normal tissue morphology; novel; Oligonucleotides; Oncogenes; Patients; Penetration; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Polymers; pre-clinical; precision medicine; Precision therapeutics; preclinical study; Prednisone; programs; Proteins; receptor; Refractory; Regimen; Relapse; Resistance development; Risk; RNA Interference; self assembly; Signal Transduction; Signaling Molecule; Small Interfering RNA; Specificity; Structure; Surface; T-Cell Lymphoma; targeted delivery; targeted treatment; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; Therapeutic Effect; therapeutic gene; therapeutic siRNA; Tissues; TNFRSF8 gene; Toxic effect; Treatment Efficacy; tumor; Tumor Tissue; Validation; Vincristine; Virulence Factors; Xenograft procedure; ,Self-assembled multifunctional aptamer-complex biomaterial for precision medicine,224304,BMBI,Biomaterials and Biointerfaces Study Section ,,,1,228750,140681,369431,

Aortic aneurysms and dissections account for 1% to 2% of all deaths in Western countries, and are usually asymptomatic until the blood vessels rupture which most often results in death. Currently, surgery is the only available treatment, and thus there is a need to understand the molecular events that lead to aneurysms in order to develop inhibitors of this process. Clinical data reveal that rupture of the aorta is preceded by vessel dilatation, elastin fragmentation, recruitment of inflammatory cells, and excess deposition of collagen and matrix proteins. We have generated a mouse in which the LRP1 gene has been selectively deleted in vascular smooth muscle cells. These mice develop symptoms similar to those in patients with aortic aneurysms, revealing that this is an ideal model for investigating the mechanisms associated with aneurysm formation. Understanding the biochemical and cellular pathways leading to aneurysm formation and defining the role of LRP1 in this process will generate important data that may allow intervention prior to rupture of the vessel.",2072820; ,"STRICKLAND, DUDLEY K.;","TOLUNAY, ESER",1/1/2017,12/31/2023,Affinity; Aneurysm; Aorta; Aortic Aneurysm; Award; Biochemical; Blood Vessels; cell growth; Cells; Cessation of life; Clinical Data; Collagen; Complex; Country; CRISPR/Cas technology; Data; Defect; Deposition; Development; Dilatation - action; Disease; Dissection; Elastin; Event; Family member; Generations; Genes; Genetic; Goals; Homeostasis; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; Intervention; LDL-Receptor Related Protein 1; Lead; Ligands; low density lipoprotein inhibitor; Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor; member; migration; Missense Mutation; Modeling; Molecular; Mus; Muscle Cells; mutant; Nature; novel therapeutic intervention; Operative Surgical Procedures; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peptide Hydrolases; Play; Problem Solving; Process; Proteins; Proteomics; receptor; Recruitment Activity; Research Personnel; Role; Rupture; Signal Transduction; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; structural biology; Structure; Symptoms; System; transcriptome sequencing; Vascular Smooth Muscle; ,Role of LDL receptor family members in protecting the vasculature,135743,ZHL1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,2,490000,267050,757050,

These biological associations and models can be improved by comprehensive sequencing of miRNA levels from total serum RNA, which goes beyond existing studies by completely characterizing the species of short RNA in the blood. Existing miRNAs studies have shown particular affinities of miRs for asthma and related inflammatory conditions, and this sequencing will allow a complete look at the ways miRs interact to influence steroid treatment response and exacerbation in asthma. Combining this with available whole-genome sequencing and blood messenger RNA expression provides an opportunity to identify integrative effects between genetic variants and miRNA expression levels and targeting proclivities that influence asthma morbidity and treatment success.

The human lipidome is made up of thousands of different lipid species, the simpler constituent components of classical lipid measures like HDL. By focusing on biologically simple canonical lipid species, we hope to more rapidly identify those genes influencing lipid variation and risk of developing CVD. In this project, we aim to identify novel genes underlying the relationship between human lipid variation and CVD using a mixed longitudinal design in extended pedigrees with available whole genome sequence data.

In this period, we propose to study the role of those residues in lipid transfer by mutation. In the meantime, we will study whether a designed inhibitor based on these residues could regulate the plasma neutral lipid transfer in animal experiments. To further the understanding of the function of a protein with a similar structure and function, PLTP, will be used to study the phospholipid transfer between HDL and LDL.

The goal of these studies is to use a combined experimental and theoretical modeling approach to understand how saliva is secreted and the processes that are altered in pathological states. This novel approach will ultimately be used to suggest novel therapies for 'dry-mouth'.,1903483; 1878930 (contact); ,"SNEYD, A.
