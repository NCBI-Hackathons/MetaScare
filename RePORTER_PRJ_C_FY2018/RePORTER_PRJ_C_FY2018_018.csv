Under normal conditions HDL protects against atherosclerosis via reverse cholesterol transport and potent antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties (HDL function). It is well established that ESRD is associated with HDL deficiency. In addition, we and other investigators have shown decreased HDL function in patients with ESRD. Recent studies have shown that HDL from patients with ESRD can actually promote inflammation thereby contributing to atherogenesis. Hence, it is no surprise that in patients with ESRD, elevated serum levels of HDL are not always associated with a reduced risk of mortality. These paradoxical findings underscore the need for future studies which focus on deciphering the role of HDL function rather than level in CV mortality. Furthermore, novel signaling pathways need to be identified which can determine HDL function thereby providing prognostic as well as therapeutic tools for future exploration. One novel and promising area which has not been explored to date, is the role of lipid-derived mediators such as endocannabinoids, fatty acid ethanolamides and ceramides in HDL function in ESRD. There is an abundance of evidence implicating these molecules in inflammation, ApolipoproteinA-I/HDL deficiency and CV disease. Therefore, these pathways are promising candidates for evaluation in ESRD. The goal of the applicant is to become an independent translational research investigator. Hence the main training objective of this CDA proposal is to provide him with experience and expertise in clinical and translational research while expanding his knowledge in pathophysiology of lipid-derived mediators. The scientific objectives of this career development award project are four fold. First, to evaluate the role of HDL function in determining the risk of CV and all-cause mortality in patients with ESRD. Second, to determine whether novel lipid-derived mediators can help determine HDL function and mortality. Third, determine the impact of age, gender, race and ethnicity on these measurements. Fourth, in-vitro studies will be performed to evaluate possible utility of FAEs in improving ApoA-I level and HDL function. The proposed application is the first clinical study in a large cohort of dialysis patients which evaluates the role of HDL function in te CV and all cause mortality associated with ESRD. In addition, this is the first clinical study to date that evaluates the association of lipid-derived mediators with HDL dysfunction and CV mortality. Therefore, the findings from this project have a significant potential for identifying prospective new targets for future examination and therapy. To conduct this study, we will be using the serum samples, laboratory and clinical data available from the MADRAD study, a NIDDK-sponsored prospective data-collection study, supported by a K24 and resources of Dr. Kalantar-Zadeh, who is a co-mentor on this application. This CDA project will be conducted in a supportive multi-disciplinary environment with a group of mentors who are renowned experts in different aspects of this proposal. The mentorship and comprehensive training program proposed in this application are designed to build on the training and expertise that the applicant has acquired so far in his career. Furthermore, several future studies based on this novel and promising proposal have been identified which build on the role of HDL function and lipid-derived mediators in CV mortality of the Veterans to be submitted as VA Merit Awards. Hence, the proposed CDA application will not only help advance our knowledge in an area critical to the care of our Veteran's population, it will also prepare and transition the applicant to a career in translational research as an independent investigator in the VA Healthcare System.",8820469; ,"MORADI, HAMID ;",,1/1/2015,12/31/2019,Acids; adjudication; Age; amidase; Anti-inflammatory; Antioxidants; Apolipoprotein A-I; Area; atherogenesis; Atherosclerosis; Award; base; California; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular disorder risk; cardiovascular risk factor; Cardiovascular system; career; Caring; Cell Culture Techniques; Ceramides; Cessation of life; Chronic Kidney Failure; Clinical; Clinical Data; Clinical Research; cohort; Coronary Arteriosclerosis; Data Collection; Deficiency Diseases; design; Diabetes Mellitus; Dialysis patients; Dialysis procedure; Disease susceptibility; End stage renal failure; Endocannabinoids; Environment; epidemiology study; Ethnic Origin; Evaluation; experience; experimental study; Fatty Acids; Foundations; Functional disorder; Future; Gender; General Population; Goals; Healthcare Systems; Hemodialysis; High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol; High Density Lipoproteins; High Prevalence; high risk; Hypertension; improved; In Vitro; Inflammation; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; Investigation; K-Series Research Career Programs; Knowledge; Laboratories; Legal patent; Lipids; Low Density Lipoprotein oxidation; Maintenance; Malignant Neoplasms; Measurement; Measures; Mediator of activation protein; Mentors; Mentorship; Metabolism; Modeling; mortality; multidisciplinary; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; new therapeutic target; novel; Outcome; Oxidative Stress; Pathway interactions; patient population; Patients; Pharmacology; Pharmacology Study; Phenotype; Play; Population; Prevalence; Prevention; Production; prognostic; Property; prospective; Prospective cohort; Public Health; public health relevance; Race; Research Personnel; Resources; reverse cholesterol transport; Risk; Role; Sampling; Serum; Signal Pathway; targeted treatment; Techniques; Therapeutic; Time; tool; Training; Training Programs; Translational Research; United States; Veterans; ,HDL function and mortality in end stage renal disease,1043,NEPH,Nephrology ,,,4,,,,

We discovered that treatment with naturally occurring protein factors can dramatically reduce damage resulting from mild brain injury, and help in the recovery from mild brain injury in mice. Because at least one of these factors has been used in humans it could potentially be applied quickly in people with brain damage. We propose to refine our model of mild traumatic brain injury and assess long-term pathological and cognitive changes. Most importantly, we will treat such impaired mice with neuroregenerative protein therapies days, weeks or months after the initial traumatic impact occurred.

PTSD is a frequent comorbidity in this population, with almost 35% of mTBI exposed Veterans reporting qualifying symptoms associated with their service in theater. The presenting symptomatology of PTSD (i.e., emotion dysregulation and cognitive deficits) may have an underlying basis in the biomechanical disruption by TBI of the coordination of brain areas for emotional processing and memory. This same disruption may interfere with effective treatment. Animal models are necessary in order to unravel the effect of TBI on the brain circuitry underlying PTSD. We will therefore utilize the most biomechanically realistic model of diffuse brain injury, the porcine rotational acceleration model, in order to elucidate how mTBI affects the  circuitry underlying PTSD and the acquisition and extinction of PTSD-like behavioral phenotypes.",11169666; ,"WOLF, JOHN ALLEN;",,1/1/2015,6/30/2018,Acceleration; Affect; Amygdaloid structure; Anatomy; Anesthesia procedures; Animal Model; Animals; Architecture; Area; associated symptom; attenuation; awake; Behavior; Behavioral; Biological; Biological Markers; Biomechanics; Brain; brain circuitry; Brain Injuries; brain pathway; Brain region; Cognition; Cognitive deficits; Communication; Comorbidity; Complex; conditioned fear; Conditioned Reflex; Conflict (Psychology); coping mechanism; cortico-limbic circuits; Development; Diagnostic; Differential Diagnosis; Diffuse; Diffuse Axonal Injury; Diffuse Brain Injury; dual diagnosis; effective therapy; Electrodes; Electrophysiology (science); emotion dysregulation; Emotional; experience; experimental study; Extinction (Psychology); Face; Failure; Family suidae; Fright; Functional disorder; Hippocampus (Brain); Impaired cognition; Implant; improved; Individual; injured; Injury; interest; Limbic System; Link; Measures; Memory; Memory impairment; memory process; mild traumatic brain injury; Military Personnel; Modeling; Monitor; Multiple Trauma; negative affect; network dysfunction; neuropathology; neurophysiology; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Phenotype; Population; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; Predisposition; Prefrontal Cortex; Prevalence; Process; psychologic; public health relevance; Qualifying; rapid eye movement; Recovery; Rehabilitation therapy; REM Sleep; Reporting; response; Risk; Rotation; service member; Services; Sleep; sleep abnormalities; Structure; symptom treatment; symptomatology; Symptoms; System; Testing; therapy resistant; Time; Traumatic Brain Injury; Veterans; ,Mechanisms of Cortico-Limbic Network Dysfunction Underlying PTSD after TBI,1479,RRD8,Career Development Program - Panel I ,,,4,,,,

Public Health Significance Recommendations from the CDC identify MSM in relationships with an HIV-positive or a non- monogamous HIV-negative partner as candidates for PrEP. HIV prevention strategies that address the specific needs of YMSM (ages 18-29) in relationships with men are needed in response to accumulating evidence which points to the unique vulnerability of these men. The proposed project tests the efficacy of an individually-delivered intervention tailored for YMSM in relationships. The intervention ? termed PARTNER ? utilizes a brief (4 session) MI format to target PrEP uptake/adherence, HIV transmission risk behavior, and associated drug use.

A multilevel approach stressing prevention-care links in the Continuum of Prevention and Care (CPC), is likely to reduce barriers to HIV prevention through integrated activities involving both community-based and healthcare organizations, while creating synergy across the intervention elements. We have developed and piloted Proyecto Orgullo (PO), a multilevel, theory-based intervention that diffuses support for and creates positive social norms around HIV prevention by building a mobilized, empowered MSM/TW community to reduce unsafe sex and promote biannual HIV testing, which has shown to be acceptable, feasible and potentially effective. In collaboration with the Peruvian Ministry o Health (MoH) and local healthcare facilities, we now propose to develop, implement and test the efficacy of PO+, an extension of PO that will facilitate full engagement in the CPC, and strengthen the linkage between the community and the healthcare system.

PTSD not only worsens TBI symptoms, such as cognitive impairments, in the delayed post- deployment period, but it also causes TBI symptoms to persist for a longer duration and confounds diagnosis and treatment. Together, these data indicate that comorbidity of TBI and PTSD significantly impacts the rehabilitative progress of TBI patients. One mechanism implicated in the cognitive impairments found in comorbid PTSD-TBI is cortical hypoactivation, a condition associated following either TBI or PTSD alone. This project aims to address the long-term effects of PTSD-TBI on cognitive behaviors resulting from molecular, structural and functional cortical impairments and to investigate long-lasting rehabilitation strategies, such as neurotherapeutic interventions, which can be implemented upon return from active duty.

Our results show that mice engineered to produce large amounts of stanniocalcin-1 protein are resistant to insults that normally cause kidney failure. Stanniocalcin-1 reduces oxidant stress in many cells and organs and appears to work through AMPK and the longevity protein SIRT3; of note, the levels of AMPK and SIRT3 vary with age and gender. This proposal will study the role of AMPK and SIRT3 in acute kidney injury, including gender differences in the susceptibility to injury and response to therapy.
