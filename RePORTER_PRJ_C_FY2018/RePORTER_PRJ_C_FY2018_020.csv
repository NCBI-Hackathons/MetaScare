Emergence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) and extraordinarily resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates has rendered the control of tuberculosis very difficult. A third of human population is infected with latent MTB from which active cases arise. Paradoxically, HIV-1 infection can deplete CD4 T cells and enhance co-infection due to tuberculosis and death rate. There is extensive lung damage during ongoing tuberculosis and in particular during MD/XDR tuberculosis and urgent methods are required to repair and restore lung function and concurrently eradicate Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) from the lungs. Phase I studies show that transfusion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs; aka.stem cells) into patients with MDR/XDR patents was safe and there was partial clinical improvement in lung function and systemic immunity. Human bone marrow derived MSCs are unique because they can be grown in large numbers in vitro and infused back into humans from both allogenic and autologous sources. This proposal will identify the biological features of stem cells and methods to condition them so that eventually, they can be used for therapeutic transfusion into human patients with MDR-XDR tuberculosis, where treatment options are limited. Thus, the proposal has immense translational value.

Annual influenza vaccination is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but the optimal vaccine regimen that portends the most protection in patients with high risk cardiovascular disease is unclear. The INVESTED study is a multi-center, randomized, active- control clinical trial of high dose influenza vaccine compared to standard dose influenza vaccine for three seasons in adult individuals with a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure who are at high risk for cardiovascular events. The primary outcome is time to first occurrence of death or cardiopulmonary hospitalization, and key secondary outcomes include time to occurrence of the cardiopulmonary death or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations, time to occurrence of all-cause death or all-cause hospitalizations, time to occurrence of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalizations, cardiopulmonary death, and all-cause death. The association between geometric mean antibody titers with the risk for death or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations will also be investigated. The results of this trial have the potential to inform health care policy regarding optimal influenza vaccination for individuals with high risk cardiovascular disease, which may in turn reduce morbidity from this annual threat to health stability in patients with cardiovascular conditions.

Since dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is key to the pursuit and enjoyment of reward, determining the brain pathways leading to its down-regulation in depression can potentially allow for discovery of new medications targeting these pathways.

These injuries include bone fractures and ligament damage. Some of these injuries may lead to poor ankle joint alignment, which over time could lead to osteoarthritis due to abnormal wear on a day to day basis. The goal of this proposal is to use a novel technology, biplane fluoroscopy, to study the movement of ankles which are misaligned in subjects with ankle osteoarthritis.

The processes underlying our brain's ability to perform this function, however, are complex. Overlapping networks have to combine auditory information (what we actually hear) and visual information (mouth movements) into a coherent perception. This processing has to occur on a rapid timescale, on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, which is the tempo of arrival of individual units of speech (syllables). In this proposal, we study how fluctuations in neuronal activity ? oscillations ? play a key role in processing speech information. We theorize that these oscillations allow networks to communicate with one another, integrate information, fill in missing information, and arrive at a coherent understanding of spoken speech. Understanding how this process occurs will directly improve our ability to treat neurological disorders involving dysfunctional speech and language processing, such as learning disabilities, dyslexia, stroke, autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and many others.",1885607; ,"SCHROEDER, CHARLES E;","GNADT, JAMES W",9/30/2016,7/31/2019,Academic Medical Centers; audiovisual speech; Auditory; Auditory area; autism spectrum disorder; base; behavior influence; Brain; Cognitive; college; Complex; Computer Simulation; Cueing for speech; Cues; Data; Dyslexia; Electric Stimulation; Electrocorticogram; Electroencephalography; Elements; Engineering; Epilepsy; Ethicists; Face; follower of religion Jewish; Foundations; Frequencies; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Gestures; Goals; Hand; Hearing; Homing; Human; improved; Income; Individual; instrument; Judgment; language processing; Learning Disabilities; Long Island; Medical center; Medicine; Methods; millisecond; Modality; Modeling; Movement; multisensory; nervous system disorder; Neurologist; neuromechanism; Neurons; Neurosurgeon; Operative Surgical Procedures; Oral cavity; Patients; Pattern; Perception; Phase; Physiological Processes; Play; Population; Posture; Process; relating to nervous system; Research Personnel; Schizophrenia; Science; Sensory; Site; skills; social; Speech; Speech Perception; speech processing; Stimulus; Stream; stroke; Structure of superior temporal sulcus; temporal measurement; Testing; Time; transmission process; Visual; Visual Cortex; visual information; visual speech; Voice; Work; ,Dynamic Neural Mechanisms of Audiovisual Speech Perception,98976,,,,S1,2,99973,54458,154431,

Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), a mechanical circulatory support system, have developed tremendously and offer considerable hope and benefit to patients with severe HF. However, they are associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, driveline infections, and thrombotic complications. Successful LVAD outcomes require careful management of anticoagulation and the complex interplay between increased bleeding and prevention of intrapump thrombus. Unfortunately, multicenter efforts to lower anticoagulation goals to minimize bleeding complications resulted in a tripled incidence of pump thrombotic complications. Intra-pump thrombus cannot be directly diagnosed but only inferred from nonspecific evidence and these suggestive markers of pump thrombus are late findings. Intrapump thrombus detected earlier may be responsive to anti-thrombotic treatment or progression stabilized by improved anticoagulation. Ultimately early recognition and clinical intervention could thrombotic complications and minimize surgical pump exchanges. In light of the increasing need and utilization of LVADs, we developed a novel, fibrin-specific 99mTc small tetrameric molecule agent (99mTc-F4A) able to bind to native thrombus under the high shear and high flow conditions of the axial flow pumps (9,000RPM - 5L/min). 99mTc-F4A clears rapidly into urine, has negligible serum interference, and has excellent detectability through the titanium pump's housing and cannulas.",7034760; 6615994 (contact); ,"ACHILEFU, SAMUEL ; LANZA, GREGORY M (contact);","BALDWIN, TIM",4/1/2015,1/31/2019,Acute Kidney Failure; Affinity; Age; Amides; analog; Animal Model; Animals; Anticoagulation; Attenuated; Binding; Biodistribution; Biomedical Engineering; Blood Transfusion; Cannulas; Cardiology; Categories; Cessation of life; chelation; Chemistry; Clinical; Clinical Data; Collaborations; Complete Blood Count; Complex; Copper; Coupling; Cyclic Peptides; Cyclization; Data; Destinations; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diagnosis; Disulfides; Doctor of Philosophy; Drug Kinetics; Economics; efficacy testing; Environment; Event; Fibrin; Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage; Goals; handheld equipment; Heart failure; Heart Transplantation; Hemorrhage; Histopathology; Housing; Image; imaging probe; implantation; improved; in vivo; Incidence; Infection; instrument; International; International Normalized Ratio; Intervention; Kidney; Leadership; left ventricular assist device; Letters; Light; Mechanics; Medical; Medicine; mid-career faculty; Modeling; molecular imaging; nanomedicine; Neurologic; novel; Nuclear; nuclear imaging; Occupations; Operative Surgical Procedures; optical imaging; Outcome; outcome forecast; Patients; Pattern; Peptides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Plasma; Prevention; Production; professor; programs; prototype; public health relevance; Pump; Race; Radiology Specialty; Recording of previous events; Records; Research; Research Personnel; Rodent; Serum; sex; Signal Transduction; Smoking; Spatial Distribution; Specificity; Splenic Infarction; Suggestion; Support System; Testing; Therapeutic; Thrombosis; Thrombus; Titanium; Translational Research; Transplantation; uptake; Urine; Vertebral column; voltage; Warfarin; Work; ,DIAGNOSIS OF LEFT VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE INTRAPUMP THROMBOSIS,122471,CMIP,Clinical Molecular Imaging and Probe Development  ,,,4,274308,144011,418319,

This knowledge will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms that promote aberrant AR activity and therapy-resistance in CRPC cells, but also may lead to develop new strategies for effective treatment of CRPC.",8850691; ,"HUANG, HAOJIE ;","LI, JERRY",2/5/2018,1/31/2023,abiraterone; Acetates; American; androgen deprivation therapy; Androgen Receptor; Androgens; Antisense Oligonucleotides; Automobile Driving; Binding; Binding Sites; Bioinformatics; Biological; Biological Markers; cancer cell; Cancer Cell Growth; cancer diagnosis; Cancer Etiology; Cancer Prognosis; cancer therapy; castration resistant prostate cancer; cell growth; Cell Lineage; Cell Survival; Cessation of life; Clinic; Clinical Trials; clinically significant; Complex; cyclin T1; Data; design; Development; Diagnosis; effective therapy; Enhancers; Future; Gene Expression; Generations; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Genome; genome-wide; Genomics; Growth; HIV-1; hormone therapy; Human; In Vitro; inhibitor/antagonist; KLK3 gene; Knowledge; Lead; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Medical Oncology; men; Molecular; Molecular Biology; mortality; mouse model; mRNA Expression; Mus; Neoplasm Metastasis; next generation; novel; Patients; Phosphorylation; Play; Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B; programs; Prostate; prostate cancer cell; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic; Proxy; Quality of life; Regulation; Resistance; Resistance development; RNA; RNA Polymerase II; RNA Splicing; Role; Sampling; Science; Serine; statistics; Systems Biology; Testing; therapeutic target; therapy resistant; Tissues; Translating; tumor; Tumor Biology; tumor progression; Untranslated RNA; Up-Regulation; Variant; Xenograft procedure; ,Mechanism and role of aberrant AR activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer,203849,MONC,Molecular Oncogenesis Study Section ,,A1,1,228750,134963,363713,

Unlike Ebola and other viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF), Lassa fever is perennial and endemic in West Africa resulting in the infection of 300,000 people and the death of over 5,000 each year. As LASV has been imported into non-endemic countries ? with more than 32 cases reported, one third of which were fatal ? the significance of enhanced detection and management of Lassa fever extends beyond West Africa. Despite the number of people affected each year by Lassa fever, civil conflict and inadequate healthcare and research infrastructure have prevented a better understanding of LASV epidemiology, pathogenesis, and viral persistence in survivors. To address these major gaps in the understanding of this important pathogen we propose to apply the clinical research infrastructure we established in West Africa during the Ebola outbreak to study Lassa fever.

Currently, cold storage of human RBCs (hRBCs) can preserve hRBCs for a maximum of six weeks (i.e. 42 days). This relatively short ex vivo storage length has been set by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) based on the post transfusion viability (PTV) of stored hRBCs at 24 hours, which must be greater than or equal to 75 ± 9% and the percent hemolysis of stored hRBCs which must be less than 1% (8). Despite widespread clinical use, stored RBCs face two major problems, namely: the steadily decreasing supply of RBC units, and the questionable clinical safety of RBCs stored for extended periods of time. It is well known that upon transfusion of stored RBCs, there is a population of RBCs (i.e. healthy RBCs) that circulate for more than 24 hours, and another smaller population (i.e. damaged RBCs) that are cleared within 24 hours post transfusion. Therefore, it could be clinically beneficial if the damaged RBCs in any unit of RBCs could be separated leaving a population of only healthy RBCs behind for transfusion. Utilizing technology that exploits the intrinsic magnetization of the deoxygenated form of Hb inside RBC's in an applied magnetic field, the Yazer, Chalmers and Zborowski laboratories demonstrated that RBCs lose magnetization during storage, which indicates that the aged RBCs lose Hb during storage. In this application, we hypothesize and experimentally test that RBCs with higher Hb content (i.e. healthy RBCs) correlate with higher deformability and PTV versus RBCs with lower Hb content (i.e. damaged RBCs).",1881179 (contact); 6709307; 1859026; ,"CHALMERS, JEFFREY JOHN (contact); PALMER, ANDRE FRANCIS; ZBOROWSKI, MACIEJ ;","ZOU, SHIMIAN",1/1/2017,12/31/2020,Acute; Acute Lung Injury; Adenosine; Adherence; Adverse effects; Age; aged; Anemia; Animal Model; Animals; Antioxidants; base; Biochemical; Biophysics; Cardiovascular system; Cause of Death; cell age; cell injury; Cells; Cessation of life; Chronic; Clinical; Communities; Cryopreservation; diphosphoglycerate; Dose; Endothelium; Erythrocyte Transfusion; Erythrocytes; Exposure to; Face; Fractionation; Heart failure; hemodynamics; Hemoglobin; Hemolysis; Hemorrhage; Hour; Human; Hypertension; Incidence; Injury; Label; Laboratories; Length; Lesion; magnetic field; Magnetism; Mechanics; microvesicles; mortality; new technology; Pancytopenia; Patients; Population; population based; Predisposition; prevent; Property; Reaction; Reporting; Risk; Safety; Systemic hypertension; Technology; Testing; Time; Tissues; Toxic effect; Transfusion; tripolyphosphate; United States Food and Drug Administration; vasoconstriction; Vesicle; Work; ,Fractionation of Aged RBCs Based on Hemoglobin Content,131720,ISD,Instrumentation and Systems Development Study Section ,,,2,474204,185589,659793,
