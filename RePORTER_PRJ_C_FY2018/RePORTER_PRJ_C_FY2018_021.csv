The obese patients often suffer from its associated illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. The healthcare costs attributed to the obesity related illnesses have significantly increased in the past decades and will continue to rise in the next 20 years.  The continued rise of this epidemic is largely due to the availability of highly dense, caloric food, and poor eating habit. The central circuit regulating food intake such as the melanocortin system in the mammalian hypothalamus has been identified and studied, but we still do not have clear understanding of how these orexigenic and anorexigenic neurons in the melanocortin system are regulated by hunger or satiety, whether these neurons respond to any or specific macronutrients, whether the intimately interwoven orexigenic and anorexigenic neurons exists in invertebrate, and how these neurons regulating feeding behavior interact with other circuits mediating related behaviors.  In this renewal application, we will investigate the functions of the recently identified orexigenic and anorexigenic neurons in the Drosophila brain and determine the mechanisms by which feeding is regulated by these neurons using genetic, molecular, physiology tools, and behavior assays readily available in Drosophila. It is also easier to conduct a large number of trials in behavior testing and other experiments using flies to accelerate our understanding of feeding behavior. These would not only provide a valuable conceptual framework, but could also lead to development of therapeutic application to treat obesity and eating disorders.",6915164; ,"SUH, GREG S.B.;","KARP, ROBERT W",9/13/2012,1/31/2022,Adult; Anatomy; Animals; Appetite Stimulants; base; Behavior; behavior test; Behavioral Assay; Biological Assay; Brain; Calcium; Cardiovascular Diseases; Caring; Coupled; deprivation; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet Habits; Drosophila genus; Dyslipidemias; Eating; Eating Disorders; Economics; Electrophysiology (science); Epidemic; Exhibits; experimental study; Exposure to; Family; feeding; Feeding behaviors; fly; Food; Food deprivation (experimental); Genes; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Glucose; Health; Health Care Costs; Hemolymph; Hunger; Hypertension; Hypothalamic structure; Image; In Vitro; in vivo; Invertebrates; L-Glucose; Label; Laboratories; Lead; Macronutrients Nutrition; Maps; Mediating; Membrane Potentials; Metabolic; Methods; Molecular; Molecular Genetics; Monitor; mutant; Neurons; Neurotransmitters; Nutrient; Nutritional; Obesity; overexpression; Palate; pandemic disease; Patients; Peripheral; Physiology; Play; Population; Potassium; preference; Process; Publishing; receptor function; Regulatory Element; response; Role; Satiation; sensor; Serotonin; Sleep; Societies; Sodium; solute; Starvation; sugar; sweet receptor; symporter; System; Taste Buds; Taste Perception; Techniques; Testing; therapeutic development; tool; Transcript; ,Characterization of Taste-independent Sugar Sensor in the Brain,116294,SCS,Somatosensory and Chemosensory Systems Study Section ,,,6,297192,172146,469338,

In gastric cancer, a large fraction of tumors is associated to the oncogenic HGF/MET axis signaling. While targeted MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies have entered clinical trials, their effectiveness in patients have been very limited, due to poor response rates and failure to meet primary end-point objective and/or to the rapid acquisition of resistance to the drug. As a consequence, gastric cancer patient with MET-dependent tumors continue to suffer high mortality rates because effective MET-targeted therapies remain unavailable.  We propose to develop a novel approach for the treatment of MET-dependent tumors. Our alternative strategy is centered on the rational design of antisense compounds that re-direct MET pre-mRNA splicing, forcing cancer cells to express naturally occurring inhibitory dominant-negative soluble decoy MET variants, in place of the oncogenic MET full-length isoforms.",8248999; ,"CARTEGNI, LUCA ;","FORRY, SUZANNE L",12/8/2017,11/30/2022,Address; advanced disease; Affect; Alternative Splicing; Antibodies; Antisense Oligonucleotides; Appearance; autocrine; base; Binding; Biodistribution; Biological; Bypass; cancer cell; Cancer Etiology; Cancer Model; Cancer Patient; cancer type; Cells; Cessation of life; Chemistry; chemotherapy; Clinical Trials; Data; design; Development; Diagnosis; dimer; Dimerization; Disease; Dominant-Negative Mutation; drug development; Drug Kinetics; Drug resistance; Drug Targeting; Effectiveness; efficacy testing; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor; ERBB2 gene; established cell line; Event; Excision; experimental study; extracellular; Failure; Future; Gene Amplification; Goals; Heterodimerization; HGF gene; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Introns; Investigation; KDR gene; knock-down; Lead; Length; Ligand Binding; Ligands; Malignant Neoplasms; malignant stomach neoplasm; Messenger RNA; MET gene; Methods; mortality; mRNA Precursor; Mutation; Neoplasm Metastasis; neutralizing antibody; new therapeutic target; Normal tissue morphology; novel; novel drug class; novel strategies; Oncogenes; Oncogenic; outcome forecast; paracrine; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Patients; Performance; Pharmacology; Phosphotransferases; Play; Polyadenylation; Preparation; programs; Property; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; receptor; Receptor Activation; Receptor Gene; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Recombinant Proteins; Relapse; Reporting; Residual state; Resistance; resistance mechanism; response; RNA Splicing; Role; Safety; Sampling; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; Specificity; STAT3 gene; subcutaneous; success; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; tool; Toxic effect; Transmembrane Domain; tumor; tumor progression; tumorigenesis; Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor; Variant; Xenograft Model; ,Therapeutic potential of antitumorigenic soluble MET variants induced by splicing interference,219689,DMP,Drug Discovery and Molecular Pharmacology Study Section ,,A1,1,261516,110824,372340,

However, there is no approved medication available to treat this precancerous disease. Clinical trials have shown that COXIBs (selective COX-2 inhibitors), originally developed for treating arthritis, are highly effective in reducing the risk of colon cancer in FAP patients. However, this class of drug cannot be used to treat FAP due to their severe side effects, including unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and cardiac thrombus. Drug companies have had to withdraw the indication for FAP of the approved COXIBs (i.e., celecoxib) from the market due to these severe side effects in the cardiovascular system, leaving thousands of patients who are at high risk of developing colorectal cancer without a safe and effective treatment. We propose to develop recycled colon bioavailable (r- CB) drugs that are only bioavailable in the colon by targeting enterohepatic circulation (EHC) via structure modification of current marketed COX-2 inhibitors, thereby reducing the systemic side effects associated with broad distribution of the drugs without sacrificing their efficacy. In the preliminary study, we have synthesized a few compounds and identified a highly active COX-2 inhibitor (GS1) that undergoes efficient EHC, resulting in low systemic exposure and high colonic exposure. In this application, we propose to evaluate the chemopreventive efficacy of GS1 in the colon using an animal model relevant to FAP. We will also investigate the mechanism of EHC and evaluate the impact of EHC on colonic drug distribution. If the concept proves successful, novel drug candidates are expected to emerge for a safer form of colorectal cancer prevention in FAP patients.",10960383; ,"GAO, SONG ;","PERLOFF, MARJORIE",1/26/2017,12/31/2018,ABCG2 gene; absorption; Address; Adenomatous Polyposis Coli; Adverse effects; Affect; Affinity; Age; Animal Model; Animals; Anti-inflammatory; Arthritis; Aspirin; base; Bile fluid; Biliary; Bioavailable; Biological Availability; Caco-2 Cells; Cannulations; Cardiac; Cardiovascular system; celecoxib; Cell Culture Techniques; Chemoprevention; Chemopreventive Agent; Chronic Disease; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Colon; colon carcinogenesis; Colon Carcinoma; Colonic Adenoma; Colonic Diseases; Colorectal Cancer; colorectal cancer prevention; Colorectal Polyp; Communities; Coxibs; cyclooxygenase 2; Data; design; Development; Disease; Dose; drug candidate; drug distribution; Drug Exposure; Drug Kinetics; effective therapy; Endoscopy; Enterohepatic Circulation; experience; Future; Glucuronides; Goals; Hepatic; high risk; Hydrolysis; in vivo; Incidence; Inherited; inhibitor/antagonist; Intestines; Kidney; Left; Liver; Lung; malignant colon tumor; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Metabolic; Metabolism; Modeling; Modification; Myocardial Infarction; Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents; novel; novel therapeutics; Organ; Patients; Perfusion; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Phenols; polyposis; Predisposition; Premalignant; Preparation; prevent; Prevention; Process; PTGS2 gene; Publishing; Rattus; Rectal Cancer; Reporting; Research; Risk; Rofecoxib; Small Intestines; Structure; Structure-Activity Relationship; Sulindac; Syndrome; Testing; Thrombus; United States National Institutes of Health; Unstable angina; Withdrawal; ,Developing Recycled Colon Bioavailable (r-CB) COXIBs for the Treatment of Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP),212937,ZCA1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,2,45000,23850,68850,

VA performance monitoring makes extensive use of healthcare measures intended to track the delivery of care to all eligible patients who might benefit from it. However, many measures instead track care only to those patients who have qualifying ICD-9 codes in VA administrative data. When there are systematic errors in coded diagnoses, performance monitoring that relies on diagnosis-based measures may fail to identify facilities that need remediation or, conversely, may lead to misallocation of resources to remediate care in facilities that are actually performing well. Diagnosis-based measures also have a critical blind spot, making patients who have the targeted condition but no coded diagnosis essentially invisible to the performance monitoring system.

The fresh water cyanobacterium, Anabaena (Nostoc) PCC 7120, encodes a sensory rhodopsin homologue. It is hypothesized that the photoreceptor interacts with a downstream gene product, a soluble transducer protein present in the same operon. The receptor mediated a signal transduction and a functional state of putative transducer is yet to be established. In ths project, we will examine the functional features (i.e., the carbohydrate (s) binding feature, phospho-transfer, lipid interaction, etc.) of a putative anabaena sensory transducer and investigate its modulation to binding to an anabaena sensory receptor. It will lead to identification and functional characterization of 'DUF' features of anabaena sensory receptor transducer homologues in a variety of microbes including pathogens, such as Tropheryma, Actinomyces and Thermobifida. Public heath relevance statement: Sensory microbial rhodopsins, in general, convey a signal via photoactivation of a membrane receptor followed by transduction cascade events via the protein-protein interaction. This work will establish that the putative transducer and its orthologs termed as a domain of an unidentified function (member of DUF1362 family) can serve as a carbohydrate binding module and can be phosphorylated by a protein kinase. This putative state can be linked to a functional state of the transducer protein. The DUF domain is present in several other microbes including pathogens. Understanding of such functional state(s) at the molecular level would be of high significance in enhancing our understanding of the cellular process inside living cells. Success of this study promises a depth of understanding of a DUF-categorized putative transducer protein and its interaction with a sensory receptor in cellular signaling. Such interactions drive fundamental membrane processes that are crucial to normal cellular function; as such, membrane dysfunctions are involved in myriad disease states.",10479771; ,"TRIVEDI, VISHWA ;","KRASNEWICH, DONNA M",5/1/2015,1/31/2019,Actinomyces; Affinity; Anabaena; analog; Bacteriorhodopsins; base; Base Sequence; Binding; Bioinformatics; Carbohydrates; Cell physiology; Cells; Cellulose; Cloning; Complex; Consensus; Coupled; Crystallization; Cyanobacterium; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; Data; Databases; Disease; DNA; Equilibrium; Escherichia coli; Event; Family; flexibility; Fresh Water; Functional disorder; gene product; Genes; Genome; genome database; GTP-Binding Proteins; Homologous Gene; Impairment; insight; interest; Ion Pumps; Ligand Binding; Link; Lipids; Mediating; member; Membrane; Microbe; microbial; Microbial Rhodopsins; Mining; Modeling; Molecular; monomer; Neighborhoods; Nostoc; novel; Operon; Orthologous Gene; pathogen; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; photoactivation; Photoreceptors; Population; Process; Property; Protein Biosynthesis; Protein Chemistry; Protein Databases; protein protein interaction; Proteins; Proton Pump; public health relevance; receptor; Receptor Activation; receptor binding; receptor-mediated signaling; Reporting; Resolution; Rhodopsin; Role; segregation; Sensory; Sensory Receptors; Sensory Rhodopsins; Series; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Signaling Molecule; Structure; success; sugar; Transducers; visual photoreceptor; Work; ,Ligand Binding and Signaling State of Anabaena Sensory Rhodopsin Transducer,113803,ZGM1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,4,67500,17775,85275,

In recent studies, we have found that microRNAs are altered in the brain of depressed subjects and are involved in coping response to stress. These studies, along with studies showing that microRNAs are involved in biological functions including synaptic plasticity, suggest that microRNAs may play a crucial role in the etiopathogenesis of major depression. Our proposed study is aimed at delineating how microRNA can contribute to the pathogenesis of major depression. Since microRNAs are ideally positioned to play a central role in regulating complex gene network, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on modulation of microRNA activity hold great promise. By using a combination of the state- of-the-art high throughput small RNA and RNA sequencing, analyzing data by novel bioinformatics tools and validation, identifying changes in microRNAs and their targets in specific cell type(s), and examining the role of microRNAs at the synaptic level in brain regions implicated in mood and cognition, our proposed study is uniquely positioned to advance the field of depression research at the molecular level.

In a proportion of subjects with NAFLD, excess liver fat can lead to inflammation (NASH) and subsequent progression to liver scarring (cirrhosis). Currently there are no methods to detect liver inflammation, except for liver biopsy. This test has limited applicability because it is invasive and can be associated with complications such as bleeding and even death. This study aims to develop a noninvasive method to detect inflammation in the liver that would allow accurate diagnosis of NASH while avoiding liver biopsy. This method consists of a novel magnetic resonance elastogram (MRE) technique, which is performed in approximately 5-10 minutes and does not require intravenous contrast administration. The results of this project could have an important positive impact on the outcomes in patients with NAFLD, by allowing noninvasive detection of patients at risk for progression of liver disease, monitoring of disease progression and response to treatment without the risks associated with liver biopsy.",14880635; ,"ALLEN, ALINA M;","SASLOWSKY, DAVID E",2/15/2018,11/30/2022,accurate diagnosis; Address; Area; bariatric surgery; Bariatrics; base; Biopsy; Calibration; career; Caring; Cessation of life; Cicatrix; Cirrhosis; Clinic; clinical practice; Clinical Research; cohort; Data; density; Detection; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Diagnostic tests; Discrimination; Disease Progression; disorder risk; Early Intervention; Environment; Epidemic; Evaluation; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Fibrosis; follow-up; Foundations; Hemorrhage; Hepatocyte; Histologic; human subject; Image; imaging biomarker; Imaging Techniques; Inflammation; innovation; interest; Intervention; Intravenous; Lead; Liver; liver biopsy; Liver diseases; liver inflammation; Lobular; Magnetic Resonance; Magnetic Resonance Elastography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Malignant neoplasm of liver; Measurement; Measures; Mentorship; Methods; Modification; Monitor; Morbid Obesity; Names; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; noninvasive diagnosis; novel; novel strategies; Obesity; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; Overweight; Patients; Performance; Population; post-doctoral training; Prevalence; Primary carcinoma of the liver cells; prognostic; Protons; Recruitment Activity; response; Risk; Role; Schedule; screening; skills; Statistical Models; Techniques; Testing; Time; Tissues; Training; treatment response; weight loss intervention; Work; ,Noninvasive detection of NASH by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE),115594,DDK,"Kidney, Urologic and Hematologic Diseases D Subcommittee ",,,1,156600,12528,169128,

Recent evidence suggests that there is considerable overlap between the processes by which we remember the past and envision the future. Despite evidence for impaired memory in Veterans with PTSD, their patterns of future thinking have not been systematically studied. Understanding the nature and mechanisms of altered future thinking in PTSD is critical, as the way in which individuals with PTSD represent future events and outcomes is thought to play an important role in the maintenance of their symptoms. More broadly, how we envision and appraise future events plays a role in many other aspects of cognition, including our ability to make adaptive choices. As such, future thinking has significant implications for optimal health decisions, successful functional integration, and general wellbeing.

Despite normal volumes and airflows, we have found that additional testing that evaluates the ability of the lungs to exchange gas is commonly impaired. This pattern ? i.e., normal volumes and airflows, but reduced gas-exchange ? is suggestive of early lung disease. The goal of the present study is to further investigate this pattern with comprehensive and non-invasive assessments of blood flow and circulation in the lungs as well as in the peripheral circulation. These data will help providers determine whether the common pattern of normal volumes and airflows but reduced gas-exchange is an unusual variant or a harbinger of subclinical lung disease.

Using a mapping and breeding strategy, we identified a mutation in the gene that encodes tomosyn-2. A mutation in tomosyn-2 directly correlates with reduced insulin secretion, elevated plasma glucose, and reduced plasma insulin levels. We are the first to connect this relatively unknown protein with insulin homeostasis, and it is still unclear what role tomosyn-2 plays in insulin secretion.

Although skillful nerve repair surgery is an important first step, there continue to be bad outcomes with incomplete recovery of use of the limb. When nerve input to the brain is lost, there are fundamental changes in how the brain works, including disordered communication between different parts of the brain. We believe that these changes persist after nerve injury even when the nerve repair is successful. We will examine brain function using advanced imaging techniques (functional magnetic resonance imaging - fMRI) in rats after experimental nerve injury, to learn about loss of brain activity coordination. In the clinical setting, this coud provide a marker that, by looking at the whole brain and its integrated operation, could guide personalized rehabilitation planning and possibly improve recovery. We will additionally test whether substituting artificial nerve activity during the healing phase maintains coordinated brain  activity, which could also be adapted for treating patients.",6198326; ,"HOGAN, QUINN H;",,1/1/2016,6/30/2018,Adult; Afferent Neurons; Anatomy; Anesthetics; Animals; Area; Attention; Behavioral; Body Regions; Brain; Central Nervous System Diseases; Clinical; Cognitive; Communication; Communication impairment; Data; Deafferentation procedure; design; dexterity; disability; Disease; Electric Stimulation; Electrophysiology (science); Elements; Esthesia; Event; Excision; experimental study; Face; Foundations; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Funding; Future; Goals; healing; high risk; imaging biomarker; imaging modality; Imaging Techniques; Implanted Electrodes; improved; injured; Injury; injury and repair; Learning; Lesion; Light; Limb structure; longitudinal design; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Maps; Measures; Modality; Monitor; Motor; Nerve; Nerve Crush; nerve injury; nerve transection; Neurons; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; operation; Operative Surgical Procedures; optogenetics; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pattern; Performance; Peripheral; Peripheral nerve injury; peripheral nerve transection; Peripheral Nerves; Phase; Photosensitivity; Population; prevent; Process; public health relevance; Rattus; Recovery; Rehabilitation Outcome; Rehabilitation therapy; repaired; Research; response; Rest; Sensory; sensory cortex; sensory input; sensory system; Severities; Signal Transduction; Site; Source; Stimulus; success; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Veterans; viral gene delivery; Visual; Work; ,Persisting functional CNS changes following peripheral nerve repair,2029,RRDS,Rehabilitation Research and Development SPiRE Program ,,,3,,,,

Annual influenza vaccination is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but the optimal vaccine regimen that portends the most protection in patients with high risk cardiovascular disease is unclear. The INVESTED study is a multi-center, randomized, active- control clinical trial of high dose influenza vaccine compared to standard dose influenza vaccine for three seasons in adult individuals with a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure who are at high risk for cardiovascular events. The primary outcome is time to first occurrence of death or cardiopulmonary hospitalization, and key secondary outcomes include time to occurrence of the cardiopulmonary death or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations, time to occurrence of all-cause death or all-cause hospitalizations, time to occurrence of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalizations, cardiopulmonary death, and all-cause death. The association between geometric mean antibody titers with the risk for death or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations will also be investigated. The results of this trial have the potential to inform health care policy regarding optimal influenza vaccination for individuals with high risk cardiovascular disease, which may in turn reduce morbidity from this annual threat to health stability in patients with cardiovascular conditions.

Urban poverty and poorly controlled asthma can both adversely impact sleep quality by disrupting the continuity of nighttime sleep. Increased asthma symptoms and sleep disruption have each been linked with changes in immune balance. The immune imbalance associated with asthma in children may be greater in the context of sleep disruption, and this may adversely impact daytime functioning and increase inflammation that can bring on asthma symptoms. This K24 application will provide mentorship in patient-oriented research to post-doctoral fellows, residents, and junior faculty interested in multi-level contributing factors to disparities in pediatric asthma. The research proposed involves the implementation of an experimental approach to examine the effects of sleep disruption on immune imbalance, asthma-related lung function, and daytime performance in urban children (ages 8-10) with persistent, allergic asthma. Results from this study ultimately will support the development of asthma and sleep interventions for urban and ethnically diverse children. Our data will elucidate how immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep operate in relation to sleep disruption, and clinical indicators of worsening asthma (lung function), to identify those most at risk, prioritize intervention targets, and improve treatment response. Mentorship goals involve providing training to post-doctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty, particularly those from minority backgrounds, in patient-oriented research focused on pediatric health disparities. The proposed career training activities to enhance knowledge and assessment of asthma clinical immunology and sleep physiology, will allow for more broadened opportunities for mentorship to trainees. In addition to the proposed research, mentees will be provided with multiple, ongoing opportunities for training in patient-oriented research on pediatric asthma health disparities.",7539341; ,"KOINIS MITCHELL, DAPHNE ;","TIGNO, XENIA",2/1/2016,1/31/2021,10 year old; actigraphy; Address; Adherence; Adult; Affect; Age; Area; Asthma; base; Beds; Behavior; Behavior assessment; Behavior Therapy; Biological; Biological Markers; career; Caregivers; Child; Childhood; Childhood Asthma; Chronic; Clinical; Clinical Immunology; Crowding; cytokine; Data; Development; Disease; Drowsiness; elementary school; Eligibility Determination; Equilibrium; Ethics; ethnic diversity; Evaluation; Experimental Designs; Extrinsic asthma; Faculty; Fellowship Program; Funding; Goals; Grant; Growth and Development function; health disparity; Home environment; Human; Immune; Immunologic Markers; improved; Inflammation; Inflammatory; innovation; interest; Interferon-alpha; Interleukin-13; Interleukin-4; Interleukin-5; Interleukin-6; Interleukins; Intervention; Intervention Studies; Investigation; K-Series Research Career Programs; Knowledge; Link; Longitudinal Studies; medical schools; Mentors; Mentorship; Methods; mid-career faculty; Minority; minority children; Nocturnal Asthma; Outcome; patient oriented research; Performance; phenomenological models; Physiology; Plasma; Polysomnography; Postdoctoral Fellow; primary caregiver; Process; programs; Protocols documentation; Psychiatry; public health relevance; Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1; Recording of previous events; Recruitment Activity; Reporting; Research; Research Design; Research Infrastructure; Research Project Grants; Resources; Respiratory physiology; Risk; Role; Schedule; Schools; Sleep; Sleep disturbances; Sleep Fragmentations; Spirometry; statistics; Symptoms; Testing; Time; Training; Training Activity; training opportunity; treatment response; Universities; urban children; urban poverty; vigilance; Work; ,Pediatric Asthma Disparities: The Role of Sleep and Immune Balance,130451,MPOR,NHLBI Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Review Committee ,,,3,94011,7521,101532,

Nephron endowment may be determined by the lifespan of renal progenitors; low nephron numbers have been linked to hypertension and other illnesses. It is unclear at present whether progenitor lifespan is regulated by progenitor-extrinsic signals (progenitor being 'evicted') or intrinsic mechanisms (progenitor 'quitting'). A better understanding of how intrinsic and extrinsic cues regulate progenitor longevity is critical for achieving our long-term goal of increasing nephron endowment in premature babies and other at-risk infants.  We have recently established that two proteins, Fibroblast growth factors FGF20 and FGF9, are necessary and sufficient to maintain embryonic kidney progenitors in vivo and in vitro. In this application, we seek to leverage this new understanding of the progenitor niche into practical knowledge about the regulation of nephron endowment. We developed a transplantation assay in which we move progenitors from an old niche to a young one and ask if they can engraft. Whereas young progenitors engraft well, only a few old ones do, and only when in contact with young cells as opposed to their own 'class mates'. We will investigate how the young cells 'rejuvenate' the old progenitors by interrogating the molecular networks controlling progenitor aging in their niche. We will evaluate the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on progenitor lifespan and nephron endowment, and aim to learn how to manipulate the network to gain more nephrons. In addition, as the field optimizes conditions for long-term expansion of nephron progenitors in vitro, we will use our engraftment method to assess their ability to make functioning organs and investigate how to best utilize them to expand the repair capacity of the adult organ.  These aims have practical implications for both the young and the aging human population. Lacking adult stem cells, the kidney has only a limited repair capacity, and repeated injury exacerbated by conditions such as diabetes can lead to end stage renal disease (ESRD). This risk is greatest for those with low nephron number (such as premature babies).

When lost (even one allele that leads to loss of protein), the RPRD1B/Kub5-Hera (K-H) gene leads to a heightened carcinogenic state after stress (e.g., after exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation). By defining mechanisms of how cells that have lost K-H become genetically unstable, we have discovered their specific vulnerability ? a `BRCAness' phenotype wherein cells become hypersensitive to IR or inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARPis). Completing the proposed research in this grant will reveal, for the first time, the mechanism by which an RNA transcriptional termination factor can regulate homologous recombination, and thereby be exploited (when lost in breast and nonsmall cell lung cancers/tumors) on an individual basis for synthetic lethal, tumor-selective therapy using PARPis or IR.

Simulation studies based on these results will explore the effective- ness of interventions targeted to the households of cholera cases and the potential value of Vibrio cholerae genetic sequence data in estimating transmission parameters.,9293718; ,"KENAH, EBEN ;","HALL, ROBERT H",4/1/2016,3/31/2018,,Semiparametric analysis of the household transmission of cholera,124017,BMRD,Biostatistical Methods and Research Design Study Section ,,,3,29699,16334,46033,
