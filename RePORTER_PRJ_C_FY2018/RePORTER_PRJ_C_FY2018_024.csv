If there is a benefit to doing an angiogram and treating with stents or surgery, then clinicians and patients must be made aware of these benefits and put them into practice to prevent bad outcomes like heart attacks and death; if the results show there is no benefit from routine invasive testing, then treatment would begin with only intensive lifestyle change and medication to control symptoms and reduce risk.

An important secondary goal is to assess the hospital/ED burden of viral pathogens associated with AGEs and ARIs, most importantly RSV, enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68), and other viruses that are potentially vaccine preventable.  The Rochester NVSN site, one of two inaugural NVSN sites since 1999-2000, is a leader in shaping all aspects of the network including population-based disease surveillance to assess the burden of vaccine- preventable diseases (VPDs) or infections that are potentially preventable by future vaccines. Rochester has a number of strengths that make it an optimal NVSN site, which are detailed in the proposal. Our specific aims are to collaborate with CDC and other NVSN sites to: 1. Actively assess the burden of AGEs and ARIs (including illness with laboratory confirmed rotavirus,  norovirus, influenza, RSV, parainfluenza virus, enterovirus EV-D68, and other pathogens) in children. 2. Evaluate the effectiveness and impact(s) of current or upcoming vaccines and other immunoprophylaxis  strategies (including calculation of influenza vaccine effectiveness among hospitalized children <18 years  of age, using modern molecular diagnostic virology methods to define cases and using a test-negative  study design to define controls); and 3. Perform additional epidemiological, health services, and laboratory studies to complement core NVSN  activities, and be prepared to expand surveillance studies to outpatient or home settings and to adults.  The over-arching goal of the proposed NVSN extension is to inform the nation about the burden of vaccine- preventable diseases and the impact of new vaccines and vaccine policies upon the healthcare and health outcomes of children.",15265135; ,"CDC DEFAULT PERSON, CDC DEFAULT PERSON ;",,9/1/2016,8/31/2021,,"Enhanced Surveillance for Newly preventable Diseases (ARI and AGE Surveillance) Rochester, NY",1049,ZIP1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,3,,,1136468,

FXS is considered the most commonly inherited form of autism. Currently, there is no effective treatment available for FXS or autism, making it one of the significant unmet medical challenges in our society. Although FXS is caused by the loss of fragile mental retardation protein (FMRP), it is unknown whether the loss of FMRP in astroglial cells, a type of abundant non-neuronal glial cell in the central nervous system, contributes to neuronal and behavioral changes observed in FXS. This project will specifically investigate the mechanisms how the loss of astroglial FMRP is involved in the pathogenesis of FXS. Especially, this project will investigate if the glutamate transporter, a cell surface protein that is highly and selectively expressed in astroglial cells and transports the important brain messenger glutamate, is altered and contributes to the development of typical FXS phenotypes.",9752021; ,"YANG, YONGJIE ;","NADLER, LAURIE S",5/15/2016,2/28/2021,Alleles; analog; Anxiety; Astrocytes; Attenuated; Autistic Disorder; Autopsy; base; Behavior; Behavioral; Binding Proteins; Brain; brain cell; Ceftriaxone; Cell Surface Proteins; Cells; Clinical; cognitive function; Data; Dendrites; Dendritic Spines; density; Development; effective therapy; Environment; Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2; experimental study; Extinction (Psychology); extracellular; FMR1; Fragile X Syndrome; frontier; Functional disorder; Glutamate Receptor; Glutamate Transporter; Glutamates; Hippocampus (Brain); Homeostasis; Human; Hyperactive behavior; Impairment; In Vitro; in vivo; Inherited; insight; Intellectual functioning disability; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Length; Mediating; Medical; Memory; Mental Retardation; Messenger RNA; Modeling; Morphology; mouse model; Mus; N-Methylaspartate; Neuraxis; Neurodevelopmental Disorder; Neuroglia; neuron loss; Neurons; new therapeutic target; novel; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Play; postnatal; Predisposition; Protein Biosynthesis; protein expression; protein function; Proteins; public health relevance; receptor; Receptor Activation; restoration; Rodent; Role; Sampling; Seizures; selective expression; Signal Transduction; Slice; Societies; Synapses; Synaptic plasticity; Testing; Translations; Up-Regulation; uptake; Virus; ,Astrolglia-Mediated Pathogenic Mechanisms in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS),106490,CMBG,Cellular and Molecular Biology of Glia Study Section ,,,3,199386,129600,328986,

Both organisms are proving increasingly difficult and expensive to treat due to the physiological phenomenon of persistence, co-infection with HIV and the emergence of drug-resistance. To discover new treatments, we need to focus on targets that have been validated in an in vivo context, and that are tractable for inhibition by small molecules. This proposal outlines experiments in which new inhibitors of PPCS, an enzyme in the pathway that synthesizes the essential cofactor coenzyme A, will be developed, tested, and iteratively improved to yield compounds with potential for development as new antitubercular and antistaphylococcal agents.",10914062; ,"STRAUSS, ERICK ;","BOYCE, JIM P",3/5/2018,2/28/2023,Address; Adherence; Aerobic; Anabolism; Anaerobic Bacteria; analog; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antibiotics; Antitubercular Agents; Back; Bacteria; bactericide; base; Binding; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Bypass; cell envelope; Cells; Cellular Assay; Clinical; co-infection; Coenzyme A; cofactor; Communicable Diseases; Communities; Cytosine; cytotoxicity; Data; design; Developing Countries; Development; Doctor of Philosophy; Drug Design; Drug resistance; Drug resistance in tuberculosis; Drug Targeting; Energy Metabolism; Energy-Generating Resources; enzyme activity; enzyme pathway; Enzymes; Evaluation; experimental study; fatty acid biosynthesis; Fermentation; Foundations; genetic resistance; Genetic study; Goals; Growth; Health; HIV; Hospitals; Human; improved; In Situ; In Vitro; in vivo; Infection; Infectious Agent; inhibitor/antagonist; interest; International; Life; macrophage; Measures; Metabolic Activation; Metabolism; Modeling; Mus; mutant; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv; Natural Products; Nosocomial Infections; novel; Organism; pathogen; Pathway interactions; phosphonate; Physiological; Prevalence; prevent; Process; Prodrugs; Proteins; Reaction; Resistance; Respiration; Ribose; Series; small molecule; small molecule inhibitor; small molecule therapeutics; South Africa; Specificity; Staphylococcus aureus; Structure; Structure-Activity Relationship; System; targeted agent; Testing; Therapeutic Agents; Tuberculosis; tuberculosis treatment; Universities; Virulence; ,Inhibitors of CoA biosynthesis as novel antitubercular and antistaphylococcal agents,136836,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,1,132905,7472,140377,

Radiation injury occurring within days after exposure is classified as ?acute injury? and often associated with direct damage to the stem cell and its niche, including the stroma and microvasculature. Late injury, which manifests months to years after exposure, is due to persistent oxidative and inflammatory signaling, aberrant stem cell regeneration, damage to the vascular stroma and scaring. Among various pharmacological approaches used, cell transplantation is one of the most effective strategies in treating radiation injury.

Atherosclerosis is driven by chronic exposure to elevated serum cholesterol levels which leads activation of vascular endothelium, deposition of lipid and inflammatory cells within the intimal layer of the artery, creating an atherosclerotic plaque. Macrophages are central mediators of disease progression within the plaque, primarily through uptake of cholesterol and production pro-inflammatory cytokines. Given the centrality of macrophages to disease, it is necessary to understand from where macrophages originate (tissue resident versus recruited), genetic profiles associated with maturing plaque macrophages, and arrangement and localization of macrophages within differing regions of the atherosclerotic plaque.
