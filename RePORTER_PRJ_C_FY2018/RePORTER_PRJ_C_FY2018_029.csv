Given that UV exposure is the primary cause of skin cancer, veterans are at higher risk for skin cancer formation. Skin cancers are by far the most common cancer seen in humans and exerts a large burden on the veteran population. Methods to reduce the rates of skin cancer formation or improved methods to treat advanced skin cancers are needed. UV increases skin cancer risk in part by suppressing the immune system that normally eliminates developing tumor cells. This study will examine a class of drugs which are known to activate a nuclear protein called peroxisome proliferators activated receptor ?. We will examine whether these drugs promote skin cancer clearance by blocking the ability of UV to suppress the immune system. Radiation therapy also suppresses the immune system. We will also determine whether these drugs also increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy by reversing the radiation treatment-induced immunosuppression.","1878247; ","KONGER, RAYMOND L;","","04/01/2017","03/31/2021","Adverse effects; Agonist; anti-tumor immune response; anticancer activity; antitumor effect; Antitumor Response; Area; base; Biological; C57BL/6 Mouse; cancer risk; Chemopreventive Agent; cis acting element; Classification Scheme; Cleaved cell; Complex; Confusion; Contact hypersensitivity; Cutaneous; Data; Defect; design; Effectiveness; Epidermis; Event; Exhibits; External Beam Radiation Therapy; factor A; Gene Targeting; Genes; Growth; high risk; Human; Immune; Immune checkpoint inhibitor; immune function; Immune response; Immune system; immunogenic; immunoregulation; Immunosuppressive Agents; Impairment; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; Inflammation; Inflammatory; insight; Integral Membrane Protein; Intervention; Ionizing radiation; Length; Ligands; lipid biosynthesis; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; melanoma; Methods; Military Personnel; Mus; Natural immunosuppression; neoplastic cell; Nuclear Protein; Nuclear Receptors; Oxidative Stress; PDCD1LG1 gene; Peroxisome Proliferators; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Play; Population; PPAR gamma; pre-clinical; Process; Production; Proteins; Radiation therapy; Regulation; response; Response Elements; Roentgen Rays; Role; rosiglitazone; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Skin Cancer; Skin Neoplasms; SLEB2 gene; Sun Exposure; Sunlight; System; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Time; TNF gene; Transactivation; Transforming Growth Factors; Transplantation; tumor; Tumor Antigens; tumor growth; Tumor Necrosis Factor Activation; tumorigenesis; ultraviolet; Ultraviolet Rays; UV induced; UV Radiation Exposure; UVB induced; Veterans; X-Ray Therapy; ","Regulation of cutaneous immune function and anti-tumor immune responses by PPARgamma-mediated transrepressive signaling","003762","IMMA","Immunology A ","","","02","","","",""

Breast cancer mortality is due to the occurrence of local and distant spread or metastasis. Breast cancer stem cells are a subpopulation, contained within the tumor mass, that are believed to be responsible for tumor spread, therapy resistance and mortality. We have identified a receptor on breast tumors, prostaglandin E receptor EP4, which promotes the survival of breast cancer stem cells and inhibits anti-tumor immune responses. We will identify effective means to block the actions of EP4 to reduce mortality from metastatic breast cancer.","1861225; ","FULTON, AMY M.;","","04/01/2009","03/31/2019","acquired immunity; adaptive immunity; anti-tumor immune response; Binding; Biological; Breast Cancer Cell; Breast cancer metastasis; breast cancer progression; breast cancer survival; cancer clinical trial; cancer stem cell; Cell Survival; Cells; Cessation of life; chemotherapy; Clinical; Clinical Research; clinically relevant; clinically translatable; Collaborations; Combined Modality Therapy; Coupled; cyclooxygenase 2; cytotoxicity; design; Development; Diagnosis; Dinoprostone; Disease; Disease Progression; Distant; EP4 receptor; Female; G-Protein-Coupled Receptors; gemcitabine; General Population; genetic approach; Goals; GTP-Binding Proteins; Health; Healthcare; Human; Immune; Individual; inhibitor/antagonist; Killings; Ligands; Link; macrophage; male; Malignant - descriptor; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammary Neoplasms; Mediating; Metastatic breast cancer; Methods; migration; mortality; Myelogenous; Natural Immunity; Natural immunosuppression; Natural Killer Cells; Neoplasm Metastasis; new therapeutic target; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutic intervention; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmacology; Population; preclinical study; prevent; Property; Prostaglandin E Receptor; Prostaglandin Receptor; public health relevance; Puerto Rico; receptor; Relapse; Research; Resistance; Role; Series; Signal Pathway; Solid; Suppressor-Effector T-Lymphocytes; Surrogate Markers; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Treatment Efficacy; treatment response; tumor; tumor growth; Tumor Immunity; Tumor Initiators; tumor progression; tumorigenic; Up-Regulation; Veterans; WFDC2 gene; Xenograft Model; Xenograft procedure; ","Targeting the COX-2 Pathway to Reduce Breast Cancer Mortality","000169","ONCA","Oncology A ","","","08","","","",""

We found that treating a pancreatic cancer cells with chemotherapy induces the expression of specific proteins that causes cancer cells to be less responsive to chemotherapy and increases their ability to spread. Further studies in our laboratory show that one of the proteins called CD44s enables pancreatic cancer to become more resistant to therapy as well as more aggressive following chemotherapy. It is central tenet of this study is to block the expression and or function of CD44 as a means to improve therapy for pancreatic cancer. A prerequisite for this is to gain a better understanding of the functional role of this protein, to better understand what causes chemotherapy to induce the expression of CD44 and to determine whether blocking the expression and/or function of CD44 will prevent spread of the cancer and will improve response to chemotherapy.","1897559; ","FREEMAN, JAMES W.;","","04/01/2015","03/31/2019","Address; Adenocarcinoma Cell; Adverse effects; Antibodies; base; Biological Markers; Biology; breast cancer progression; cancer cell; Cancer Cell Growth; Cancer Etiology; cancer stem cell; CD44 Antigens; CD44 gene; Cell Line; Cells; chemotherapy; Data; Down-Regulation; Engraftment; Environment; Epithelial; epithelial to mesenchymal transition; Excision; Exons; Flow Cytometry; gemcitabine; Gene Expression; Genetic Transcription; Growth; Homing; Hyaluronan; Hypoxia; Immunoglobulin Class Switching; improved; in vivo; insight; Integral Membrane Protein; Kinetics; knock-down; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Link; Malignant neoplasm of pancreas; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Micrometastasis; migration; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; outcome forecast; pancreatic cancer cells; Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma; Patients; Phenotype; phrases; Play; Population; prevent; Process; Property; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; Proteoglycan; public health relevance; Reporting; Research; Resistance; Resistance development; response; RNA Splicing; Role; Signal Transduction; Site; small hairpin RNA; Snails; stem-like cell; Stress; Stromal Cells; Switch Genes; Testing; therapy resistant; Transcription Repressor/Corepressor; Treatment Efficacy; tumor; Variant; ","Role of CD44 in adaptive plasticity of pancreatic cancer","002962","ONCC","Oncology C ","","","04","","","",""

The care of veterans constitutes a significant portion of the overall VA health care budget. Traditional medical therapy of cancer has used empiric chemotherapy without regard to the underlying biology of the cancer. In contrast, KIT-mutant cancers represent a unique model for the development of targeted therapies for cancer. Oncogenic KIT mutations are found in the vast majority of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and mast cell neoplasms, as well as subsets of melanoma, AML, and seminoma. Notably, GIST is the most common adult soft tissue sarcoma and is a cancer associated with Agent Orange exposure. Our proposal seeks to improve therapy for KIT-mutant malignancies by identifying by the mechanisms by which LMTK3 regulates expression of oncogenic KIT protein.","9494847; ","HEINRICH, MICHAEL ;","","04/01/2009","03/31/2020","Acute Myelocytic Leukemia; Adult; Affect; agent orange; Alleles; American; Antineoplastic Agents; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biological Assay; Biological Process; Budgets; Cancer Biology; cancer cell; cancer therapy; Caring; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Cells; chemotherapy; Clinical; clinically relevant; conventional therapy; Development; Disease; Drug resistance; Effectiveness; gain of function mutation; Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors; Genetic Transcription; Growth; Healthcare; Human; Imatinib; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; knock-down; Lemurs; Lesion; Libraries; Ligands; Luciferases; Maintenance; Malignant Neoplasms; Mass Spectrum Analysis; mast cell; Mast Cell Neoplasm; Mediating; Medical; melanoma; Melanoma Cell; Messenger RNA; Methods; model development; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mRNA Expression; mutant; Mutation; Nature; Neoplasms; neoplastic cell; novel strategies; novel therapeutic intervention; Oncogenic; Pathogenicity; Patients; Phosphorylation Site; Phosphotransferases; Play; promoter; protein complex; Protein Isoforms; Protein Tyrosine Kinase; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Proteins; public health relevance; Quality of life; Radiation; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Regulation; Reporter; Resistance; Resistance development; resistance mutation; response; Role; scaffold; Seminoma; Series; Small Interfering RNA; Soft tissue sarcoma; Stem Cell Factor; targeted agent; targeted cancer therapy; therapeutic target; Toxic effect; transcription factor; Transcriptional Regulation; tumor; Tumor Biology; Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor; Veterans; ","Regulation of oncogenic KIT by LMTK3","000338","ONCC","Oncology C ","","","07","","","",""

It causes peptic ulcer disease in 10% and gastric carcinoma in 1-3% of those infected. Stomach cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. American servicemen/women are frequently exposed to H. pylori at sites of duty where prevalence of this infection is high, and they are at risk of acquiring virulent strains that are harder to treat and associated with carcinogenesis. Antibiotics are not useful if precancerous lesions have occurred. Our studies will investigate mechanisms by which H. pylori causes a futile inflammatory response that leads to ongoing tissue injury and DNA damage that can progress to cancer. We will focus on how alterations in the metabolism of the amino acid arginine leads to pathologic events, including immune dysfunction and aberrant epithelial cell responses.

Moreover, in 2014, chronic airways obstruction/asthma ranked as the 16th in the same database. Apart from their frequent co-existance, these diseases interact with, and worsen, one another. In our preliminary work, chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH)-a hallmark feature of OSA-administered during allergen-induced airway inflammation led to airflow deficits, as a result of shift toward Th-1 - predominant airway inflammation and detrimental changes to lung structure, which may be irreversible. Herein, we will test the physiologic, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the CIH-induced airway obstruction during allergen challenge. Our research will lead to more targeted and effective therapies for Veterans afflicted by OSA/asthma, and will be highly relevant to other common lung diseases, such as emphysema and fibrosis.","8920922; ","TEODORESCU, MIHAELA ;","","04/01/2016","03/31/2020","Address; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; airway inflammation; Airway Obstruction; airway remodeling; Airway Resistance; Allergens; Allergic; Asthma; asthmatic patient; Attenuated; Benefits and Risks; Bone Marrow; Breathing; Bronchoalveolar Lavage; Bronchodilator Agents; Caring; Chronic; Clinical; Collaborations; Collagen; Comorbidity; Data; Databases; density; Deposition; design; Development; Diagnosis; Dichloromethylene Diphosphonate; Disease; disorder control; Distal; effective intervention; effective therapy; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; experimental study; Fibrosis; Flow Cytometry; Functional disorder; Goals; Healthcare; Histologic; Histology; Hypoxia; Immunohistochemistry; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; Investigation; Knowledge; Link; Literature; Lung; Lung diseases; macrophage; Marrow; Measures; Modeling; Molecular; monocyte; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; novel; Obstruction; Obstructive Sleep Apnea; Oxygen; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phenotype; Physiological; Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1; Positioning Attribute; prevent; Process; Property; protein expression; public health relevance; Publishing; Pulmonary Emphysema; Pulmonary Fibrosis; Pyroglyphidae; Quality of life; Rat-1; Rattus; Rattus norvegicus; Research; Research Methodology; Resistance; Respiratory physiology; Rodent Model; Role; Rosa; Saline; screening; Services; Smooth Muscle; Structure; Structure of parenchyma of lung; System; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; Veterans; Work; ","Mechanisms of Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia Induced Airflow Obstruction during Allergic Lower Airway Inflammation","002880","PULM","Respiration ","","","03","","","",""

Despite progress in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior, the pathogenesis is poorly understood, including alterations in the neural circuitry underlying affective instability (AI) which is associated with suicidal behavior. In order to provide new targets for prevention interventions, it is important to understand what patterns of brain activity may lead to increased risk for suicide. This longitudinal study will inform our understanding of the neurobiology of suicidal behavior and determine whether a promising non-verbal, low- cost psychophysiological measure (affective startle modulation) predicts future suicidal behavior. Specifically, we aim to assess AI in four groups (healthy controls, non-suicidal psychiatric controls, suicidal ideators, and suicide attempters) using self-report, psychophysiology, and neuroimaging (fMRI). Understanding the biology of suicidal behavior and prospectively identifying those at greatest risk has clear public health impact.","1911413; ","HAZLETT, ERIN A.;","","04/01/2017","03/31/2021","accomplished suicide; Affect; Affective; affective modulation of startle; Amygdaloid structure; Attention; base; Behavior; Behavioral; Biological; Biological Factors; Biological Markers; Biology; Brain; Clinic; Clinical assessments; clinical risk; cohort; cost; Data; design; Diagnostic; Dimensions; Down-Regulation; emotion regulation; Emotional; emotional reaction; Emotions; endophenotype; Exhibits; experience; follow up assessment; follow-up; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Future; Generations; habituation; high risk; Impairment; Individual; interest; Intervention; Lead; Life; Link; Literature; Longitudinal Studies; Major Depressive Disorder; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Mental disorders; Military Personnel; mind control; multimodality; National Institute of Mental Health; neural circuit; Neurobiology; neuroimaging; neuromechanism; novel; Participant; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Patient Self-Report; Patients; Pattern; Phenotype; Physiology; Population; Prevention; prevention service; Preventive Intervention; Process; prospective; Proxy; Psychological Factors; Psychometrics; Psychophysiology; psychosocial; Public Health; reducing suicide; Regulation; relating to nervous system; Research; Research Personnel; response; Risk; Risk Factors; Sampling; Services; suicidal; suicidal behavior; suicidal risk; Suicide; Suicide attempt; suicide attempter; Suicide prevention; Symptoms; Testing; Time; trait; Translating; two-dimensional; Veterans; Work; ","Neurobiology of Affective Instability in Veterans at Low and High Risk for Suicide","001451","MHBA","Mental Health and Behavioral Science A ","","","02","","","",""

Studies are proposed to further explore the mechanism by which NKLAM augments these immune responses. Military personnel are exposed to carcinogens and new, antibiotic resistant bacteria are emerging. Declining immunity with aging, along with other medical comorbidities, put our veterans at greater risk for developing cancer and severe disease upon exposure to pathogens. One goal of these studies is to develop a therapeutic strategy for delivering NKLAM to treat and perhaps ultimately, prevent cancer and infectious diseases.

During tendon aging, the interactions involving these small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) that result in an impaired injury response will be defined. Our general hypothesis is that tendon aging and the impaired age-associated response to tendon injuries are the result of similar SLRP-mediated mechanisms.

We propose to learn how the vsRNA is generated and delivered to cells, and to validate our in vitro findings in HCV-infected veterans. We also propose to characterize which cellular genes are regulated by the HCV vsRNA, and identify additional HCV vsRNAs that regulate gene expression in hepatocytes and immune cells.

If successful, we hope to prove this mechanism as an elusive upstream disease origin in a number of undiagnosed individuals at risk for pulmonary hypertension and that synergistic therapeutic targeting of this pathway may prevent or even reverse this devastating disease. Furthermore, as exceedingly little is known about the regulation and function of iron-sulfur clusters in chronic acquired human diseases, the results could define an entirely novel disease origin applicable to conditions other than PH that share similar hypoxic-ischemic and metabolic pathogenesis.","9644957; ","CHAN, STEPHEN Y;","XIAO, LEI","09/01/2015","03/31/2020","base; Biogenesis; Biological Assay; Biological Models; Biology; Biophysics; Blood Vessels; Cardiopulmonary; Catheterization; Cells; Chronic; Clinical; clinical care; Complement; Coupled; Disease; Dissection; Down-Regulation; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Electron Transport; Endothelium; Exercise stress test; Family; Foundations; frataxin; Functional disorder; Genetic; Human; human disease; Human Genetics; Hypoxia; in vivo; indexing; Individual; inhibitor/antagonist; Iron; iron deficiency; Knockout Mice; Link; loss of function; Lung; Measures; Metabolic; Metabolic Control; Metabolic Diseases; Metabolism; MicroRNAs; Mitochondria; mitochondrial metabolism; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; new therapeutic target; novel; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathway interactions; Patients; PECAM1 gene; Persons; Physiological; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Population; PPAR gamma; prevent; Prosthesis; Proteins; public health relevance; Pulmonary Hypertension; Regulation; Repression; Respiration; Risk; Rodent; Role; sensor technology; Severities; Sulfur; Sulofenur; Testing; therapeutic target; Translating; Up-Regulation; Vascular Diseases; Vascular Endothelial Cell; Vascular Endothelium; ","Iron-Sulfur Deficiency as a Critical Pathogenic Cause of Pulmonary Hypertension","122596","RIBT","Respiratory Integrative Biology and Translational Research Study Section ","","","05","250000","140626","390626",""

Prior studies of similar redevelopment initiatives lack the comparative research design, and none, to our knowledge, have measured cardio-metabolic risk factors in a high-risk, yet understudied African American resident base.

Small animal models of human cancer represent the golden standard and the first step in preclinical development phase of all promising anti-metastatics. High-throughput screening of such models requires non-invasive imaging techniques, which are currently incapable of detection, quantification, and monitoring response of early metastatic lesions. This project proposes development of a novel small animal imaging platform integrating photoacoustic tomography and fluorescence in a single compact instrument, enabling high-resolution 3D rendering and anatomical registration of metastatic lesions. Adequate sensitivity and specificity is provided by an optically switchable dual contrast nanoprobe with cancer-specific molecular targeting.

Good glycemic control can inhibit DR in motivated patients, but is difficult or impossible for many to achieve and maintain. Likewise, other therapies (such as fibrates) seem to inhibit DR progression, but only in a subgroup of diabetic individuals. Thus, additional therapeutic approaches are needed to reduce vision loss in diabetes.

Our investigations have revealed that the conserved RNA polymerase-binding protein DksA is essential to Salmonella pathogenesis. Our investigations will characterize the novel role of the DksA zinc finger in coordinating transcriptional responses to various levels of oxidative stress encountered by Salmonella in the host. Based on our basic knowledge of DksA, we have already identified a drug against DksA with excellent antibiotic activity. Our investigations will guide the rational development of antibiotics against DksA and will test their effectiveness against drug resistant nontyphoidal Salmonella as well as a variety of Gram-negative clinical isolates.","2239605; ","VAZQUEZ-TORRES, ANDRES ;","","04/01/2013","03/31/2021","Affect; alpha helix; Antibiotic Resistance; Antibiotics; Antioxidants; Bacillus (bacterium); Bacteria; Bacterial Genes; Bacterial Infections; bacterial resistance; base; Binding; Binding Proteins; C-terminal; Campylobacter; Cessation of life; Clinical; clinically relevant; Coiled-Coil Domain; Complex; Cysteine; Dangerousness; Development; Diarrhea; Disease; disulfide bond; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase; drug development; Drug resistance; drug resistant bacteria; Drug Targeting; Effectiveness; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli EHEC; Eubacterium; experimental study; extracellular; Family; Future; Gastroenteritis; Gene Expression; General Population; Genes; genetic regulatory protein; Genetic Transcription; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Hemophilus; HIV; Hospitals; Human; Individual; Infection; innovation; Intervention; Investigation; Knowledge; Lead; Legionella pneumophila; Life; Mammals; Mediating; Medical; men; Metabolic Control; Metabolism; microorganism; Military Personnel; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Analysis; Molecular Chaperones; Molecular Target; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Multi-Drug Resistance; N-terminal; novel; Output; oxidation; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Oxidoreductase; Pathogenesis; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phylogenetic Analysis; Play; programs; Prokaryotic Cells; prophylactic; Proteins; Pseudomonas; Regulation; Research; Resistance; response; Role; Salmonella; Salmonella enterica; sensor; Shigella; Shigella flexneri bacterium; stem; Stress; Structure; Sulfenic Acids; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; Transcription Initiation; Transcriptional Regulation; Veterans; Vibrio; Vibrio cholerae; Virulence; Woman; Work; Zinc Fingers; ","Molecular Analysis of Bacterial Adaptive Response to Host Reactive Species","002073","INFB","Infectious Diseases B ","","","06","","","",""

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive form of lung cancer and is strongly associated with recurrence after treatment, and short survival. We will capture and characterize SCLC heterogeneity by treating naïve tumors and tumors after escaping chemotherapy. To identify cellular subpopulations, we will use powerful single cell mass cytometry, whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing of cancer cells exposed to drug treatments. We will identify driver genetic alterations that are uniquely associated with tumor progression, including therapy-induced mutations and phenotypic alterations. We hope to uncover SCLC heterogeneity and its implications for therapy. This translational work offers considerable promise for the benefit of this group of Veterans.

Human PBC patients present clinically long after the initiating pathological events; often the disease is end- stage at the first clinic visit. Animal models of disease are critical to advancing our understanding of early ABD immunopathogenesis. Here we study a novel congenic mouse which pathologically closely resembles human PBC, allowing us for the first time to mechanistically dissect immunogenetic pathogenesis.

The pathogenesis of asbestos-induced lung diseases is incompletely understood. The proposed studies will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying asbestos-induced alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) cell death (apoptosis), which is a key event leading to fibrosis and carcinogenesis. Specifically, we investigate the role of AEC mitochondria DNA, SIRT3 depletion (increased mitochondrial acetylation), and intrinsic apoptosis. These studies will also characterize the role of SIRT3 in regulating a mitochondrial DNA repair enzyme (OGG1) and aconitase in preventing asbestos- and bleomycin-induced AEC apoptosis and lung fibrosis. Notably, the asbestos paradigm should provide insights into the pathogenesis of other more common diseases (i.e. lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), which are frequently present in veterans and for which more effective management strategies are needed.","2098824; ","KAMP, DAVID W;","","04/01/2011","03/31/2020","8-Oxoguanine DNA Glycosylase; Acetylation; Aconitate Hydratase; Alveolar; alveolar type II cell; Amphiboles; Apoptosis; Asbestos; Asbestosis; Attenuated; biological adaptation to stress; Bleomycin; Bronchogenic Carcinoma; carcinogenesis; Cell Death; cell injury; Cell Survival; Cells; Cessation of life; Crocidolite Asbestos; Disease; DNA; DNA Damage; DNA Repair; DNA Repair Enzymes; effective therapy; Electron Transport; Epithelial Cells; Event; Exposure to; Fiber; Fibrosis; genetic approach; Hamman-Rich syndrome; Health; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; injury and repair; innovation; insight; International Union Against Cancer; Lung; Lung diseases; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Mesothelioma; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial DNA; mitochondrial dysfunction; mitochondrial metabolism; Mitochondrial Proteins; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; Neurons; novel; OGG1 gene; overexpression; Oxidants; Oxidative Stress; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Pharmacology; Population; Preparation; prevent; Protein Acetylation; protein function; public health relevance; Pulmonary Fibrosis; Reactive Oxygen Species; Resveratrol; Role; Signal Transduction; Sirtuins; SOD2 gene; Toxin; TP53 gene; Veterans; Wild Type Mouse; ","Mechanisms of Asbestos-Induced Alveolar Epithelial Cell Injury","000786","PULM","Respiration ","","","07","","","",""

They are commonly prescribed to Veterans. Unfortunately, when patients with pain are given opioids the required dose tends to rise over time (tolerance) and patients paradoxically become sensitized to pain from new and existing injuries (hyperalgesia). Increasing doses of opioids can result in serious side effects overdose and death. These have emerged as major problems for the VA despite its commitment to improving pain control for its patients. The reasons why patients adapt to the use of these drugs and the interactions between opioid adaptations and pain are very poorly understood. We hypothesize that epigenetic mechanisms are largely responsible. This novel hypothesis is supported by molecular, cellular and behavioral evidence. By controlling the involved epigenetic mechanisms and targets we may make pain treatment safer and more effective for veterans and others suffering from chronic pain requiring ongoing opioid therapy.","1927582; ","CLARK, DAVID J.;","","04/01/2010","03/31/2020","Ablation; Acute; Acute Pain; addiction; Adverse effects; adverse outcome; Affect; Affinity; Alcohol or Other Drugs use; Analgesics; Attention; Behavioral; Biological Assay; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; cell type; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); chromatin immunoprecipitation; Chronic; Chronic Disease; chronic pain; Clinical; Clinical Management; Clinical Research; CREB1 gene; Data; Development; disability; Dose; Drug Interactions; Drug usage; Effectiveness; Environmental Risk Factor; EP300 gene; Epigenetic Process; experience; functional outcomes; Gait; Genes; Goals; high risk; Histone Acetylation; Histones; Hyperalgesia; improved; in vivo; indexing; Individual; Injury; Intrinsic factor; Knockout Mice; Laboratory Study; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Messenger RNA; Methods; Molecular; Morphine; mouse model; Mus; Neurons; Neurotransmitters; Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Type 2; novel; novel strategies; Operative Surgical Procedures; Opioid; opioid epidemic; opioid exposure; opioid overdose; Opioid Receptor; opioid therapy; opioid use; Outcome; overdose death; Pain; Pain management; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Pharmacology Study; Phosphorylation; Play; Population; Positioning Attribute; Posterior Horn Cells; Primary Hyperalgesias; promoter; Proteins; public health relevance; Publishing; receptor; Regulation; relating to nervous system; Reporting; Risk; Role; Severities; Signal Transduction; Source; Spinal; Spinal Cord; Spinal cord posterior horn; Substance P; Surgical incisions; Syndrome; Time; Tissues; transcriptional coactivator p75; Trauma; treatment effect; Up-Regulation; Veterans; Work; ","Epigenetic Modulation of Pain X Opioid Interactions","000881","NURA","Neurobiology A ","","","07","","","",""

Obesity, increased age, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are all risk factors contributing to neurodegeneration, placing Veterans at higher risk than general population. AD, PD, and TBI result in the loss of neurons producing the hormone orexin. Studies show this hormone protects against neurodegeneration, promotes healthy body weight, and may improve cognition. Orexin loss may thus result in reduced ability to defend against the biochemical processes driving neurodegeneration. The ability to 're-awaken' dormant orexin circuits by increasing orexin signaling represents a therapeutic intervention that could boost endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms and counteract some comorbidities of neurodegenerative disease. We propose a series of studies to test this theory, with a long-term goal of developing interventions aimed at slowing or preventing progression of neurodegenerative diseases.","1944196; 1878927 (contact); ","BILLINGTON, CHARLES J.; KOTZ, CATHERINE M (contact);","","04/01/2016","03/31/2020","Adult; Age; Alzheimer's Disease; Animals; Apoptotic; Area; Automobile Driving; Biochemical Process; Body Weight; Brain; Cell Death; Cells; Chronic; Cognition; Cognitive; cognitive change; Cognitive deficits; cognitive function; cognitive performance; Comorbidity; Data; Depressed mood; Designer Drugs; Development; Disease; Disease model; endoplasmic reticulum stress; Etiology; General Population; Goals; Health; high risk; Hippocampus (Brain); Hormones; Human; Huntington Disease; hypocretin; Hypothalamic structure; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; Infusion procedures; Intervention; Learning; Link; Measures; Memory; memory consolidation; Metabolic; misfolded protein; MJD1 protein; Modeling; mouse model; Mus; mutant; Narcolepsy; Nerve Degeneration; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuron loss; Neurons; neuroprotection; novel; novel therapeutics; Obesity; Parkinson Disease; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Predisposition; prevent; Proteins; public health relevance; receptor; Replacement Therapy; response; Risk Factors; Series; Signal Transduction; Suggestion; synucleinopathy; Testing; theories; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; Transgenic Mice; Transgenic Model; Traumatic Brain Injury; Veterans; Work; ","Rescue of dormant brain circuits in neurodegenerative disease","003004","NURA","Neurobiology A ","","","03","","","",""

MicroRNAs are potent regulators of gene expression and play important roles in inflammation and cardiovascular disease.

My research seeks to understand pathogenic mechanisms in PD by exploring PD related to glucosidase, beta acid 1 (GBA1), a gene identified as the strongest known genetic risk factor for PD. However, most individuals with GBA1 deficiency do not develop PD, suggesting a critical role for genetic modifiers. I will identify modifiers of GBA1 pathogenicity using an unbiased Drosophila genetic screen based on a novel Drosophila GBA1 deficiency model. Preliminary results from this screen have identified modifiers that suggest a model where changes in ceramide cause the neurodegeneration seen in GBA1-associated PD. In addition to testing this hypothesis, I will also test whether modifiers identified by the Drosophila model translate to modification of rate of progression of motor and or cognitive symptoms in patients with PD. The potential impact of this proposal is large, as it could lead to clinically translatable findings, and novel therapeutic targets for PD, a common neurodegenerative disease.","12224356; ","DAVIS, MARIE Y;","","01/01/2017","12/31/2021","Acids; Affect; Age; Age-Years; aging population; Alpha-glucosidase; Area; Autophagocytosis; Autophagolysosome; Autophagosome; Award; base; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; career; Caring; Ceramides; Clinical; clinically relevant; clinically translatable; Cognitive; cognitive testing; cohort; Data; Defect; Dietary Supplementation; Disease; Disease model; Disease Progression; Disease susceptibility; Drosophila genus; Enzymes; Evaluation; Fat Body; fly; Gene Frequency; Genes; Genetic; genetic risk factor; Genetic Screening; Glucose; glucosidase; Glucosylceramides; Healthcare Systems; Heterogeneity; Human; human disease; Idiopathic Parkinson Disease; Immunoblotting; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; Individual; innovation; insight; interest; Invertebrates; Lead; Learning; Libraries; Link; lipid metabolism; Lipids; locomotor deficit; Longevity; Longitudinal cohort; loss of function; Lysosomes; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Mentors; Metabolism; Methodology; Minor; Modeling; Modification; Morphology; Motor; motor symptom; mutant; Mutation; mutation carrier; Nerve Degeneration; Neurobehavioral Manifestations; Neurodegenerative Disorders; new therapeutic target; next generation sequencing; novel; Organelles; overexpression; Parkinson Disease; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Patients; Performance; Phenotype; Play; Predisposition; protein aggregation; protein biomarkers; Research; Research Personnel; Risk; Role; screening; Screening Result; sex; Suggestion; Symptoms; Techniques; Testing; thought control; Time; Training; Transferase; Translating; Translations; Variant; Veterans; Work; ","Understanding Susceptibility to Parkinson's Disease due to GBA1 Mutations","003244","NURE","Neurobiology E ","","","02","","","",""

We observe marked mitochondrial damage, and deficiencies of key mitochondrial-associated mediators, including nuclear-encoded mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and BNIP3a, and mitochondrially encoded humanin, in aging and OA cartilage chondrocytes. We will test roles of impaired mitochondrial function and biogenesis, and effects of dysfunctional mitochondrial quality surveillance by the mitophagy and ubiquitin proteasomal systems, on molecular inflammation and functional failure of chondrocytes that promote cartilage degeneration.

Importantly, lymphoma is one of the few cancers for which the risk was significantly increased among Vietnam veterans. In addition, more recent data (1996-2007) from Italian army peacekeeping troops in the Balkans, also preliminarily suggested an increase in lymphoma incidence. Although the mechanism associated with this elevated risk of lymphoma development have not been fully defined, chemical exposure in the battlefield as well as contact with infectious agents are likely possibilities. Thus, it should be expected that with the current extended deployment of US military forces in foreign lands, a new wave of increased lymphoma diagnosis in military personnel may ensue. To specially attend to the needs of this population, we critically need research that: a) leads to a better understanding of lymphoma biology, b) identifies novel biomarkers for diagnosis and early detection, and c) facilitates the development of more effective and less toxic therapeutics.","7874954; ","AGUIAR, RICARDO C;","","04/01/2013","03/31/2021","activation-induced cytidine deaminase; Address; Adult; Affect; Agreement; Animal Model; Apoptosis; B cell differentiation; B Cell Proliferation; B lymphoid malignancy; B-Cell Development; B-Cell Lymphomas; B-Lymphocytes; Balkans; BCL2 gene; BCL6 gene; Biological; Biology; Biopsy; Blood Cells; cancer type; CD19 gene; Cell Line; Chemical Exposure; Chromosomal translocation; Clinical; Complex; Data; Deletion Mutation; Development; Diagnosis; differentiated B cell; Disease; DNA; Early Diagnosis; Ectopic Expression; Enhancers; Enzymes; Epigenetic Process; Family; Fostering; Functional disorder; gain of function; Gene Fusion; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Genomics; Goals; histone methyltransferase; Human; IFN consensus sequence binding protein; IGH@ gene cluster; Immune; Immuno-Chemotherapy; Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation; In Vitro; in vivo; Incidence; Infectious Agent; Interferons; Knowledge; large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Lesion; Link; Lymphoma; Lymphomagenesis; Maintenance; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant lymphoid neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Maps; Massive Parallel Sequencing; Mature B-Lymphocyte; member; Military Personnel; MLL2 gene; Modeling; mouse model; Mus; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; next generation sequencing; novel; novel marker; Oncogenes; Oncogenic; Other Genetics; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; PAX5 gene; Phenotype; Physiological; plasma cell differentiation; Point Mutation; Population; PRDM1 gene; pressure; Process; programs; Proteins; Reaction; Reporting; Research; Resistance; Risk; Role; Secondary to; Somatic Mutation; Structure of germinal center of lymph node; Testing; Therapeutic; trait; transcription factor; Transgenic Organisms; tumor; Tumor Suppressor Genes; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Variant; Veterans; Vietnam; Western World; ","IRF8 and lymphomagenesis","001882","HEMA","Hematology ","","","06","","","",""

Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) occurs in about 20% of patients with AMD but accounts for the majority of vision loss in the disease. The exact molecular and pathological mechanism(s) that lead to CNV have not yet been identified. Almost all patients with SFD develop CNV and therefore it is a useful model to examine the pathophysiology of this phenotype. The knowledge gained from these studies will not only contribute to our understanding of fundamental principles of neovascularization, but may also lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches for SFD as well as AMD and other diseases in which angiogenesis play a critical role.  ","2104598; ","ANAND-APTE, BELA ;","SHEN, GRACE L","04/01/2017","03/31/2021","Age related macular degeneration; angiogenesis; Angiogenesis Inhibition; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Angiogenic Factor; base; Bilateral; Binding; Blindness; C-terminal; CD44 gene; Cells; Choroid; Choroidal Neovascularization; Clinical; Code; Comparative Study; Data; Degenerative Disorder; Development; Disease; Endothelial Cells; Exons; experimental study; Extracellular Matrix; Exudative age-related macular degeneration; FGF2 gene; Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors; Functional disorder; Genes; genetic association; Growth Factor; Hyaluronan; In Vitro; Inherited; KDR gene; Knock-in Mouse; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lasers; Lead; macula; Matrix Metalloproteinases; Mediating; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; MMP9 gene; Modeling; Molecular; Mus; mutant; Mutant Strains Mice; Mutation; neovascularization; new therapeutic target; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peptides; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Play; Protein Region; Proteins; Rare Diseases; Regulation; Reporting; Retina; Role; Signal Transduction; Sorsby's fundus dystrophy; STAT3 gene; Testing; TIMP3 gene; Transgenic Mice; Tumor Cell Migration; Variant; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors; Vision; ","Regulation of Choroidal Neovascularization in Sorsby's Fundus Dystrophy","027083","DPVS","Diseases and Pathophysiology of the Visual System Study Section ","","","02","225000","131625","356625",""

The goal of this proposal is to provide safety and early efficacy data on therapy using a selective cytopheretic device (SCD), an extracorporeal membrane device that can sequester activated leukocytes and inhibit their inflammatory activity in order to reduce tissue accumulation and resulting tissue damage in patients. The SCD will be evaluated use in pediatric ICU patients that have acute kidney injury or septic shock associated acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy. There is nearly a 50% mortality rate of pediatric patients with this disorder. The lack of medical devices specifically designed for pediatric applications has been recognized by directives in the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007, included in Public Law 110-85, and the Institutes of Medicine, which has recommended pediatric studies to begin at the end of Phase II clinical trials involving adults Inflammatory. The relevance of this proposal to public health is that the SCD would greatly reduce the multiorgan effects in pediatric patients suffering from acute kidney injury or septic shock associated acute kidney injury, thus improving the clinical outcome of these pediatric patients affected by these disease processes.","1902861; 1917702 (contact); ","GOLDSTEIN, STUART L; HUMES, H.

This problem might be even worse among veterans given that the frequency of depressive symptoms is 2 to 5 times higher than among the general US population. This situation put a high burden on patients with depression due to worsening quality of life and increasing health care costs. A breakthrough discovery happened in recent years when investigators found that a single infusion from an old anesthetic named ketamine showed high efficacy and rapid antidepressant effect (within hours) but lasted only up to a week. We propose to study if multiple infusions of ketamine have greater antidepressant effects than one infusion. If that is the case, multiple infusions could help depressed veterans that do not response to common antidepressant drugs.","12032687; ","SHIROMA, PAULO R.;","","04/01/2015","03/31/2019","accomplished suicide; Acute; Adverse effects; Adverse event; Affinity; Agonist; Alcohols; Anesthesia procedures; Anesthetics; antidepressant effect; Antidepressive Agents; Anxiety; Barbiturates; Behavioral; Bipolar Depression; Bipolar Disorder; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Clinic; Clinical Trials; Cognitive; Data; Dental crowns; Depressed mood; depressed patient; depressive symptoms; Discipline of Nursing; Disease; Disease remission; Dose; Drug Kinetics; effective therapy; Eligibility Determination; Evaluation; Event; Exclusion Criteria; Failure; Female; follow-up; Frequencies; functional disability; Glutamate Receptor; Goals; health administration; Health Care Costs; hemodynamics; Homicide; Hour; hypomania; improved; indexing; Infusion procedures; Intervention; Interview; Intravenous; Intravenous infusion procedures; Ketamine; Major Depressive Disorder; male; Manic; Measures; Medical; Mental Depression; Mental Health; Methodology; Midazolam; Military Personnel; Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors; N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors; N-Methylaspartate; Names; novel; Outcome; Pain intensity; Parkinson's Dementia; Participant; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Phase; Pilot Projects; placebo controlled study; Placebos; Population; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; Pregnancy; Prevalence; Procedures; Process; Psychotic Disorders; public health relevance; Quality of life; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; recruit; Registries; Relapse; Reporting; Research; Research Design; Research Personnel; response; Risk; Sampling; Schedule; screening; secondary outcome; Seizures; Severities; Substance Use Disorder; suicidal; suicidal risk; Symptoms; Telephone; Testing; Time; Traumatic Brain Injury; treatment duration; Treatment Efficacy; Treatment outcome; treatment responders; treatment-resistant depression; trial comparing; Unipolar Depression; Veterans; Visit; ","Intravenous Sub-anesthetic Ketamine Treatment in Treatment-Resistant Depression","001191","CLNA","Clinical Trials - A ","","","04","","","",""

The currently approved immuno-modulatory drug therapies have limited efficacies since the disease continues to progress. This reflects a lack of full understanding of disease mechanisms and the unavailability of drugs targeting critical disease processes. The present proposal is based on our novel findings documenting beneficial effects of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a naturally occurring nitric oxide compound, in an animal model of MS. We have observed that GSNO specifically reduces myelin- reactive lymphocyte activation and their inflammatory functions in the central nervous system, thus attenuating disease pathology in animal models of MS. Based on these studies, the present proposal is to delineate the mechanisms underlying GSNO-mediated immuno-modulation, and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of GSNO in MS, and thus to develop novel GSNO-based therapeutics to ameliorate MS in Veterans.","1878276; ","SINGH, INDERJIT ;","","04/01/2015","03/31/2019","Adoptive Transfer; Adverse effects; Affect; Animal Model; Animals; Attenuated; attenuation; Atypical lymphocyte; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmune Process; Autoimmunity; base; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Blood Vessels; Brain; C57BL/6 Mouse; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cell physiology; Cells; Central Nervous System Diseases; Chronic; clinically relevant; Demyelinating Diseases; design; Disease; Disease model; Disease Progression; Drug Targeting; effective therapy; Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis; Genetic; Health; Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte; Homeostasis; Human; Human body; Immune response; Immunize; Immunologic Monitoring; immunomodulatory drugs; immunoregulation; in vivo; Individual; inducible gene expression; Infiltration; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; Interleukin-6; JAK2 gene; Knock-out; Laboratories; Lesion; Lymphocyte Activation; Mediating; Mission; Modeling; Multiple Sclerosis; multiple sclerosis treatment; Mus; Myelin; nervous system disorder; Neuraxis; neuroprotection; neurotrophic factor; new therapeutic target; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Synthase; nitrosative stress; NOS2A gene; novel; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Oxidoreductase; p65; Pathologic; Pathology; Peroxonitrite; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Pharmacotherapy; Phase; Phosphorylation; Physiological; Play; Post-Translational Protein Processing; Process; prophylactic; public health relevance; Rattus; Regulation; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; Reporting; Role; S-Nitrosoglutathione; Severities; Signal Transduction; SJL Mouse; Spinal Cord; STAT3 gene; stressor; Supplementation; Testing; Therapeutic; Treatment Efficacy; Veterans; ","Immunomodulation and Neuroprotection in Multiple Sclerosis","002829","NURB","Neurobiology B ","","","04","","","",""

Early on, the legitimacy of GWVI was questioned, because no specific physiological etiology had been identified. More recently, the existence of GWVI was confirmed by the American Congressionally mandated Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, which concluded: 'evidence strongly and consistently indicates that two Gulf War neurotoxic exposures are causally associated with Gulf War illness: (i) use of pyridostigmine bromide pills, and (ii) pesticide use during deployment.' Enormous efforts have gone into elucidating potential toxicological causes for GWVI, but to date, no explanation proffered has provided a clear explanation, especially for the brain symptoms of 'acquired cognitive and neuropsychological dysfunction.'

It comprises an increasingly common neurodegenerative disease with profound motor, cognitive, and behavioral dysfunction. More than a million Americans suffer from PD, of whom more than 80,000 are Veterans, and about 50,000 new cases are diagnosed annually. The burden of PD is especially heavy in the Veteran population, due in part to the aging demographic, since age is the best documented risk factor, as well as the risks of exposure to environmental neurotoxins in military settings. An epidemiologic study at our center revealed a PD prevalence of 2.1% in VHA-enrolled Veterans over 65 years of age. The US economic burden of PD for patients, families, and society is estimated by the Parkinson's Action Network at $14.4 billion annually. This cost is expected to skyrocket as almost eight million baby boomers have recently turned 60, the age at which PD prevalence begins to increase sharply.","1899081; ","CLARK, ROBERT A;","","04/01/2016","03/31/2020","Address; Age; Age-Years; alpha synuclein; American; analytical tool; Animal Model; awake; Axon; base; Behavioral; Biochemical; Biological Markers; Brain; Cellular Morphology; Code; Cognitive; cognitive task; Confocal Microscopy; Consensus; cost; Crossbreeding; Demographic Aging; Dendrites; Deposition; Deterioration; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Discrimination; Disease; disease diagnosis; Disease Outcome; Disease Progression; disorder risk; dopaminergic neuron; Early Diagnosis; Economic Burden; Electron Microscopy; Enrollment; epidemiology study; Etiology; Event; experimental study; Exposure to; Face; Family; Functional disorder; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Funding Opportunities; Genetic; Genetic Models; Histologic; Histology; Human; Idiopathic Parkinson Disease; Imaging technology; Impairment; in vivo; Injury; innovation; insight; interest; Internal Ribosome Entry Site; Interneurons; Knowledge; LacZ Genes; Lead; Link; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Manganese; Maps; Measurable; Methods; Military Personnel; mitral cell; Modality; Modeling; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Motor; Mouse Protein; Mus; Nerve Degeneration; neural circuit; neurobehavioral test; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuroimaging; Neurons; Neurotoxins; novel therapeutics; Odorant Receptors; Odors; olfactory bulb; olfactory bulb glomeruli; Olfactory Pathways; olfactory sensory neurons; Oxidative Stress; Parkinson Disease; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pattern; Phase; Play; Population; Population Study; postsynaptic; pre-clinical; Prevalence; prognostic; prospective; Proteins; public health relevance; Research; Resolution; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Sensory; Signal Transduction; Smell Perception; Societies; Sorting - Cell Movement; Structure; Synapses; synuclein; synucleinopathy; System; tau Proteins; Therapeutic; Time; Toxic effect; Transgenic Mice; Veterans; ","Analysis of Olfactory Dysfunction for Early Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease","003157","NURE","Neurobiology E ","","","03","","","",""

Our studies employ genomics and women's health issues. We have obtained peptides that bind with high affinity and specificity to the ErbB-2/ErbB-3 receptors, the lectin gal-3 and its carbohydrate ligand TF, and CD44v6 on cancer initiating cells. These antigens are overexpressed on many cancer cells and function in key steps in tumorigenesis. The peptides will form the basis of development of scaffolds that can function in optical and diagnostic radioimaging or therapy. In terms of human health, radiolabeled versions of the peptides may translate into safe and specific imaging probes for ovary, breast, and prostate cancer diagnosis as well as response to therapy. The peptide constructs will improve the standard of care of patients in that the peptides will be well tolerated in humans and radiolabeled versions will specifically target cancer cells not normal cells so as to minimize undesirable radiation side-effects.","1867964; ","DEUTSCHER, SUSAN L;","","07/01/2011","03/31/2020","Adenocarcinoma; Adverse effects; Affinity; angiogenesis; Antibodies; Antigens; Bacteriophages; base; Binding; Biodistribution; Biological Markers; Breast; Breast Carcinoma; cancer biomarkers; cancer cell; Cancer Detection; cancer diagnosis; Cancer Etiology; cancer imaging; cancer therapy; cancer type; Carbohydrates; castration resistant prostate cancer; CD44 gene; Cell Adhesion; Cell physiology; Cells; Cessation of life; Clinical Trials; Detection; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Dimerization; Drug Kinetics; Drug resistance; Engineering; Female; fluorescence imaging; Future; Galectin 3; Gender; General Population; Generations; Genomic medicine; Genomics; glycosylation; Goals; Health; Healthcare; Hormones; Human; Image; imaging agent; imaging probe; immunogenic; Immunoglobulin Fragments; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Incidence; interest; Interruption; Kidney; Label; Laboratories; Lectin; Libraries; Ligands; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of ovary; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Medicine; Military Personnel; Mission; Modeling; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; nanoparticle; Nature; Neoplasm Metastasis; novel; Optics; outcome forecast; Ovarian Carcinoma; Ovary; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Patient Care; Patients; Peptides; personalized medicine; Phage Display; Population; Positron-Emission Tomography; Prostate; Prostate carcinoma; Protein Engineering; public health relevance; Radiation; Radiochemistry; Radioimmunoconjugate; Radiolabeled; receptor; recruit; Relapse; Research; response; RNA Splicing; scaffold; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Specificity; standard of care; Stem cells; success; Symptoms; targeted agent; targeted imaging; targeted treatment; Technology; Therapeutic; therapy resistant; Thompson-Friedenreich Antigen; Toxic effect; Translating; tumor; Tumor Antigens; tumor progression; Tumor stage; tumorigenesis; United States; uptake; Variant; Veterans; Woman; Women's Health; Work; ","Phage Display for Improved Peptide-Based Tumor Targeting and Imaging Agents","000964","CAMM","Cellular and Molecular Medicine ","","","06","","","",""

Of the estimated 700,000 Americans suffering a stroke each year 40% are left with moderate impairment and up to 30% have severe disabilities. Direct inpatient and outpatient annual costs to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) are in excess of $300 million with cost of care correlating with level of disability. Physica therapy (PT) remains the primary strategy to improve motor function, but there is a clear need to enhance its efficacy. The development of adjunct therapy to provide neurorestorative benefit is needed. The goals of this project are to demonstrate that fibroblast growth factor therapy is such a strategy and to delineate the mechanisms through which it works. The findings of this project will provide the framework on which to develop more efficacious drug-enhanced rehabilitative therapy for stroke patients.

BD is associated with loss of brain volume and disruptions in daily (circadian) rhythms in sleep and behavior. Lithium is an inexpensive, effective treatment for BD that protects neurons, and restores circadian rhythms. However, 30-50% of patients with BD fail respond to lithium treatment and intolerable side effects are common. Lithium non-responsive patients are delayed in receiving effective treatment and require more expensive drugs. In order to gain insights that will allow for the future development of tools to identify lithium responsive patients rapidly, this study investigates the molecular interactions among circadian rhythms, neuroprotection and lithium in cell-based models of lithium response.","9713593; ","MCCARTHY, MICHAEL JOSEPH;","","04/01/2017","03/31/2021","Adverse effects; Affect; Apoptosis; ARNTL gene; Attenuated; base; Behavior; Binding; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Bipolar Disorder; Brain; brain abnormalities; brain volume; Cell Death; Cell Line; Cell model; Cell Survival; Cells; Cellular Assay; Cessation of life; circadian pacemaker; Circadian Rhythms; Clinic; Clinical; cost; curve fitting; Cytoprotection; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; disability; effective therapy; Etiology; excitotoxicity; Fibroblasts; Functional disorder; Future; Gene Abnormality; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic; genetic manipulation; Glutamates; Goals; Gold; gray matter; Hippocampus (Brain); Human; Hypothalamic structure; improved; insight; Intervention; knock-down; Laboratories; Length; Link; Lithium; Manic; Measures; Mental Depression; Mental disorders; Methodology; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Mood stabilizers; mood symptom; Moods; mortality; Mus; Necrosis; neuronal survival; Neurons; neuroprotection; neurotrophic factor; novel; Occupational; Outcome; oxidative damage; Oxidative Stress; Pathway interactions; Patients; Periodicity; Peripheral; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacogenetics; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Population; precision medicine; predictive of treatment response; Predisposition; protective effect; Recurrence; Reporter Genes; Reporting; resilience; response; Risk; Running; Skin; Sleep; Small Interfering RNA; social; standard care; Statistical Data Interpretation; Stem cells; suicidal risk; suicide rate; suprachiasmatic nucleus; Symptoms; Syndrome; Techniques; Testing; Tissues; tool; tool development; Treatment outcome; treatment response; Veterans; Work; ","Circadian rhythms and cell survival in lithium responsive bipolar disorder.","003431","NURR","Neurobiology R ","","","02","","","",""

A nanoparticle-based device that enables the direct light-activation of NaVs of RGCs would represent a major advance toward developing nano- prosthetic therapies for advanced-stage age-related macular degeneration and other retinal degenerative diseases that involve loss of rod and cone photoreceptor function. In our recent in vitro study of neurons (dorsal root ganglion cells and hippocampal brain slices) that possess NaVs, we have shown that gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) joined to a biomolecule that binds the AuNPs near the neurons? NaVs enable action potential generation by these cells in response to light. Here we propose to develop this AuNP technique to achieve light-induced, AuNP-mediated action potential generation by RGCs in the living eyes of our experimental animal (rat).","1883269; 1965944 (contact); ","BEZANILLA, FRANCISCO J; PEPPERBERG, DAVID R (contact);","GREENWELL, THOMAS","04/01/2017","03/31/2019","absorption; Action Potentials; Age related macular degeneration; Animals; Anterior; Antibodies; base; Binding; biomaterial compatibility; Brain; Bypass; Cell membrane; Cell surface; cell type; Cells; Chicago; Companions; comparative efficacy; Coupling; Data; Degenerative Disorder; design; Devices; Doctor of Philosophy; Electron Microscopy; Electrophysiology (science); experimental study; Eye; Fluorescence; Fluorescence Microscopy; Fluorescent Dyes; fluorophore; ganglion cell; Ganglion Cell Layer; Generations; Goals; Gold; Hippocampus (Brain); Histologic; Illinois; Immunofluorescence Immunologic; In Vitro; in vivo; in vivo imaging; Light; light microscopy; Longevity; Measures; Mediating; Membrane; millisecond; Modeling; Morphology; nano; nanoparticle; nanorod; neurofascin; Neurons; Optics; Pharmacology; Photoreceptors; Photosensitivity; Physiologic pulse; Physiological; Preparation; Property; Prosthesis; Proteins; Protocols documentation; Radiation; Rattus; receptor; Research; response; Retina; Retinal; Retinal Cone; Retinal Degeneration; Retinal Diseases; Retinal Ganglion Cells; retinal neuron; retinal rods; Signal Transduction; Slice; Sodium Channel; Spinal Ganglia; Streptavidin; Structure; Synapses; Techniques; Testing; Tissues; TRPV1 gene; Variant; Vertebrate Photoreceptors; Vision; Visual; Visual evoked cortical potential; voltage; ","Cell-targeted Gold Nanoparticles for Photo-excitation fo Retinal Ganglion Cells","027101","BNVT","Bioengineering of Neuroscience, Vision and Low Vision Technologies Study Section ","","","02","153545","45395","198940",""

Due to combat exposures, an even greater proportion (52.6%) of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with epilepsy also had TBI, at 3 times the rate in civilian populations, underscoring the present and continuing importance of PTE to the VA. A period of years is often present between the TBI and the first seizure of PTE, during which a slowly evolving process induces permanent changes in the brain (epileptogenesis). Currently we are unavailable to detect epileptogenesis during this critical but clinically silent period, and no treatments are available. The goal of this project is to utilize a novel animal model of PTE to identify electrographic biomarkers of epileptogenesis, leading to improved diagnosis, and to survey molecular mechanisms underlying post-traumatic epileptogenesis, which will guide the development of therapeutics for this currently untreatable condition.","12309701; ","KOTLOSKI, ROBERT JOSEPH;","","04/01/2016","03/31/2021","Acute; Acute Brain Injuries; Amyloid beta-Protein; Anatomy; Animal Model; Animals; Appearance; Award; Biological Markers; biomarker development; Brain; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; career; career development; Caring; Chronic; Clinic; Clinical; combat; Comorbidity; controlled cortical impact; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Disease; Doctor of Philosophy; educational atmosphere; Electrophysiology (science); Entropy; Environment; Epilepsy; Epileptogenesis; Equipment; Evaluation; Fellowship; forest; Frequencies; Funding; Genetic; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Goals; Grant; Health; Health Expenditures; High Frequency Oscillation; Hour; Human; Immunoblotting; Immunohistochemistry; Impairment; improved; Individual; injured; Injury; innovation; instructor; Joints; Knowledge; Laboratories; Laboratory Research; Manuscripts; medical schools; Mentors; Molecular; mossy fiber; Neurologist; Neurology; neurophysiology; novel; Pattern; Population; prevent; Preventive treatment; Process; protein expression; public health relevance; Quality of life; Rat Strains; Rattus; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Research Training; Residencies; Residual state; Resistance; response; Seizures; skills; Sprague-Dawley Rats; Stimulus; Structure; Surveys; tau Proteins; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic development; therapeutic target; Time; Training Support; Traumatic Brain Injury; Universities; Variant; Veterans; Veterans Hospitals; Wisconsin; Work; Writing; ","TBI and posttraumatic epilepsy in plasticity susceptible and resistant rats","002986","NURB","Neurobiology B ","","","03","","","",""

That this effect occurred independent of weight loss raises the exciting possibility that exercise combined with weight loss could reduce OSA by at least 50% and have unique health benefits for OSA patients. Following screening and baseline assessments, 90 overweight veterans ages 18-60 years with OSA will be randomized to one of three 16- week treatments: (1) exercise training; (2) 10 % weight loss; and 3) exercise + weight loss.

The proposed novel research explores the relationship between circadian disturbance in the heart, altered local heart hormone actions, and the development of heart failure.

In the future this knowledge may be critical in the diagnosis, treatment and management of vulnerable patient populations debilitated by the vast array of age-induced pathologies.","7110481; ","HAMRICK, MARK W;","","","","Address; Affect; Age; age related; Age-Related Bone Loss; aged; Aging; Animals; Aromatic Amino Acids; base; Biodistribution; Biological Assay; bone; Bone Density; bone loss; Bone Marrow; Bone Marrow Stem Cell; bone mass; Bone Resorption; Caloric Restriction; Cell Differentiation process; Cell physiology; Cells; Characteristics; clinical practice; cost; cytokine; Data; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease Outcome; Elderly; Event; exosome; experimental study; extracellular vesicles; falls; Fracture; Functional disorder; Future; Genes; Goals; Hematopoietic; Human; Impairment; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammatory; Injury; Intervention; Knowledge; Kynurenine; Mesenchymal; MicroRNAs; microvesicles; Molecular; Molecular Target; Mus; Muscle; Muscle Fibers; muscle form; Muscular Atrophy; Musculoskeletal; Myoblasts; Nutrient; Organ; Osteoblasts; osteoclastogenesis; Osteoclasts; Osteogenesis; osteogenic; Osteoporosis; Outcome; Pathology; Pathway interactions; patient population; prevent; Process; progenitor; Public Health; Quality of life; Reporter; Role; Rosa; sarcopenia; Signal Transduction; small molecule; Source; Stem cells; Stimulus; Stromal Cells; Testing; Tissues; Transplantation; uptake; ","Project 2 - Role of bone-derived exosomes in musculoskeletal aging","036675","ZAG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","6028","","07","222349","115622","","337971"

Despite current optimal therapy, there are 300,000 deaths every year in the US due to heart failure. Among these 6 million patients, 3 million have heart failure with normal ejection fraction, a measure of the heart?s ability to pump blood. However, conventional therapies, which have been shown to prolong life in patients with heart failure with low ejection fraction, fail to prolong life in patients with normal ejection fraction heart failure. Because the prevalence of heart failure with normal ejection fraction is increasing, and outlook is dismal, we need new treatments. We propose, based on studies performed in the previous tenure of our VA Merit award, that intravenous delivery of a virus vector encoding urocortin-2 is a promising approach for these patients.

However, systemic toxicity from these drugs can significantly impact patient's quality of life and overall survival. To address these limitations of chemotherapy, we propose a transformative technology where the chemotherapy drug is intra-arterially infused from a drug-eluting stent (DES) and captured along the venous outflow of the tumor using an intravascular drug-capturing device (DCD). First we will develop the DES (Aim 1), then develop the DCD (Aim 2) and finally test the drug release and capture concept in rat and rabbit animal models (Aim 3). Successful development of such a system will represent a paradigm shift in the oncology community by improving patient's quality of life, potentially prolonging survival, resurrecting failed Phase I trials from drug toxicity, increasing the use of FDA- approved previously toxic drugs, and opening up new clinical trials to test much higher doses. The proposed idea of drug release and capture represents a platform technology and may have unparalleled impact in other diseases. For example, the system can be designed to isolate exposure to thrombolytic therapy or immunosuppressants.","8527169; 10243591 (contact); ","KHADEMHOSSEINI, ALI ; OKLU, RAHMI  (contact);","WOLFSON, MICHAEL","06/06/2017","03/31/2021","Address; Adverse effects; Angiography; Animal Model; Anthracyclines; Antineoplastic Agents; antineoplastic antibiotics; Area; Arteries; base; Binding; Biocompatible Materials; Biomedical Engineering; Blood Circulation; bronchial artery; Bypass; Cancer Model; Cancer Patient; Catheters; Chemistry; chemotherapy; Clinical Trials; Community Clinical Oncology Program; cost; Dangerousness; Data; design; Detection; Development; Devices; Dialysis procedure; Disease; DNA; Dose; Doxorubicin; drug testing; Drug toxicity; Drug usage; Drug Utilization; Ensure; Evaluation; Excision; experience; Exposure to; FDA approved; femoral artery; Hematologic Agents; Hemofiltration; Hepatic artery; Iliac Vein; Image; Immunosuppressive Agents; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Inferior vena cava structure; Infusion procedures; innovation; Interleukin-2; Intravenous; Liver; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of liver; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammary gland; Microspheres; minimally invasive; Modeling; Monitor; novel strategies; oncology; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Pelvis; Performance; Perfusion; Pharmaceutical Preparations; phase I trial; Platinum; prevent; Prevention; Procedures; Property; prototype; Pulmonary veins; Quality of life; Rattus; Risk; Site; Stents; Stream; Surface; Surface Properties; System; systemic toxicity; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Embolization; Thrombolytic Therapy; Time; Topoisomerase Inhibitors; Toxic effect; Treatment Efficacy; Treatment Protocols; tumor; Validation; Vascular blood supply; Veins; Venous; ","Targeted chemotherapy delivery and capture","024403","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","448920","89100","538020",""

Currently ~30% of the bipolar Veterans receive chronic lithium therapy, which also effectively prevents suicidal tendencies. However, the therapeutic use of lithium is often limited by the development of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a kidney condition. Currently used medications for the treatment of NDI have side effects and may not be suitable in many Veterans. The observations made by the applicants that P2Y12 receptor can be targeted for the treatment of lithium-induced NDI opened an avenue for the development of better therapeutic modalities.

Might there be simple measures (modulating iron by controlling intake or by phlebotomy, for example) to minimize the impact of such shift work? Finally, given the fact that clinical trials are currently underway to determine if decreasing iron will improve glycemic control in diabetes or delay the onset of steatohepatitis, it is imperative that we understand the full ramifications of altering iron on metabolism.

The suffering and disabilities caused by RA impose a huge financial burden on the healthcare and rehabilitation of Veterans. Many potent drugs are available for the treatment of RA, but their prolonged use is associated with severe adverse reactions. The goal of our study is to develop a novel method of drug delivery primarily into swollen (inflamed) joints, thereby sparing other organs from unwanted drug toxicity. We recently identified small peptides, which when injected into the bloodstream, preferentially home to the inflamed joints. We will study the effects of these peptides on cells of the inner lining (endothelium) of blood vessels of the joints, and use these peptides to direct drug-carrying vesicles (liposomes) from the bloodstream into the joints.","1969359; ","MOUDGIL, KAMAL D;","","04/01/2015","03/31/2019","Address; Adjuvant Arthritis; Adverse effects; Adverse reactions; Affect; Aging; alanine aminopeptidase; American; Aminopeptidase P; antiarthritic agent; Antibodies; Antigen Targeting; Arginine; Arthritis; arthropathies; Aspartic Acid; Attenuated; Autoantigens; autoimmune arthritis; Autoimmune Process; Autoimmune Responses; Autoimmunity; Bacteriophages; base; Binding; Blood Circulation; Blood Vessels; bone; cell motility; Cells; Characteristics; Chronic; Code; Collaborations; combat; Comparative Study; Cyclic Peptides; design; Detection; Development; disability; Disease; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Targeting; Drug toxicity; Encapsulated; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium; Event; experience; Experimental Models; Gene Expression Profile; Glucosephosphate Isomerase; Glycine; Goals; Health; Health Care Costs; Healthcare; Heat shock proteins; Heterogeneity; Home environment; Homing; Human; Immunity; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; innovation; insight; Institutes; Integrins; Intra-Articular Injections; joint injury; Joints; Knowledge; Leukocytes; Ligand Binding; Liposomes; Mediator of activation protein; Medical Research; men; Methodology; Methods; migration; Military Personnel; Modeling; Molecular; molecular marker; neoplastic cell; new therapeutic target; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; Organ; Organ Specificity; Pain; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Peptide Phage Display Library; Peptides; Phage Display; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Poisons; Polyethylene Glycols; Population; Prevalence; Process; Proteins; public health relevance; Publishing; Quality of life; Rat-1; Rattus; receptor binding; Receptor Cell; Rehabilitation therapy; Reporting; Research Institute; Research Personnel; Reticuloendothelial System; RGD (sequence); Rheumatoid Arthritis; Series; Signal Transduction; Stress; Surface; Synovitis; System; systemic autoimmune disease; systemic toxicity; T-Lymphocyte; targeted delivery; Therapeutic Agents; Therapeutic Effect; Therapeutic Index; Therapeutic Uses; Time; Tissues; treatment strategy; tumor; uptake; Vascular Endothelial Cell; Vascular Endothelium; Vesicle; Veterans; Wit; Woman; Work; ","Anti-arthritic activity and therapeutic use of novel joint-homing peptides","002424","IMMA","Immunology A ","","","04","","","",""

Justifiably the VA has declared metabolic disorders such as obesity a priority area for research. The mechanism by which obesity damages kidney function is not well understood. Although circulating insulin level is elevated in obesity, whether it activates the insulin recepto in the kidney leading to damage is not known. We have evidence that while high fat diet induces obesity associated kidney injury in normal mice, it is ameliorated in mice genetically lacking the kidney insulin receptor. We also noted that insulin receptor activation in the kidney of high fat diet fed mice was associated with reduced production of hydrogen sulfide.

For example, rates of TB in Iraq and Afghanistan are 16- and 45-fold higher than in the U.S., respectively, and management of TB risk is a major challenge for military public health. The global emergence of drug-resistant forms of TB makes this risk even greater. Military occupational exposures are a CSR&D priority research area. This proposal aims to develop new biomarkers for TB which would enhance veteran health for several reasons. New TB drugs are urgently needed to shorten treatment and treat drug resistance but clinical trials are held back by lack of an early marker for treatment failure. A new marker would change the clinical trial landscape and could also be used to monitor individual patients. An additional aim is validating a new form of host-pathogen interaction through RNA interference. If confirmed, this mechanism could provide new targets for therapy.","10806822; ","WALTER, NICHOLAS D;","","04/01/2014","03/31/2019","3' Untranslated Regions; active method; Afghanistan; Antimycobacterial Agents; Antitubercular Agents; Area; Back; base; Binding; Biological Markers; Biological Process; biomarker evaluation; Blood; Bronchoalveolar Lavage; Cell Line; cell type; Cells; Clinical; clinical care; Clinical Trials; clinically relevant; cohort; Communities; comparison group; Conflict (Psychology); Country; Data; Disease; Drug resistance; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profile; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Granulomatous; Health; high throughput screening; Human; Immune response; Immunity; Impairment; improved; Incidence; individual patient; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Intention; Iraq; Lung; macrophage; Messenger RNA; Microarray Analysis; Military Personnel; Molecular; Molecular Profiling; Monitor; mRNA Expression; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; new therapeutic target; novel; novel marker; Occupational Exposure; pathogen; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pattern; Pneumonia; Public Health; public health relevance; Pulmonary Tuberculosis; Reporting; Research Priority; response; response biomarker; Risk; RNA; RNA Interference; service member; Services; Site; Small RNA; Specificity; Specimen; Surrogate Endpoint; targeted treatment; Testing; Time; TNF receptor-associated factor 3; Transcript; transcriptome sequencing; Treatment Failure; treatment response; Tuberculosis; tuberculosis drugs; tuberculosis immunity; tuberculosis treatment; Uganda; Untranslated RNA; Veterans; Whole Blood; ","Blood Expression Profiles as a Biomarker for Responses to Tuberculosis Treatment","000914","INFB","Infectious Diseases B ","","","05","","","",""

A major goal of the proposed studies is to determine the mechanisms that lead to chronic gastrointestinal pain in deployed Gulf War Veterans. The proposed studies will provide: (1) an innovative model to explain chronic gastrointestinal pain in Gulf War Veterans that were deployed into war zones; and (2) a novel way to treat them. Indeed, our model, which holds that the above gastrointestinal pain is due to altered miRNA signaling is supported by our preliminary data. Given that there are currently no specific treatments for these disorders, and that current symptomatic approaches are far from ideal, proof of principle of our model would be an extremely important advance as it would not only have a beneficial impact on the health of many thousands of our Veterans, but also it would substantially reduce the many negative economic effects of this ailment on the VA health care system.","10281862; ","ZHOU, QI QI ;","","04/01/2017","03/31/2021","AMPA Receptors; base; Cells; Chronic; Chronic Disease; Colon; combat; Data; Development; diagnostic biomarker; Disease; Down-Regulation; Economics; effective therapy; epigenetic regulation; Epithelial Cells; Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders; ganglion cell; gastrointestinal; Gene Expression; Gene Targeting; Glutamate Receptor; glutamatergic signaling; Glutamates; Goals; Gulf War; Health; Healthcare Systems; Human; Hypersensitivity; in vivo; innovation; Lead; Mediating; Methods; MicroRNAs; Modeling; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors; N-Methylaspartate; Nociception; novel; Opioid; Opioid Receptor; Pain; Pain Disorder; Pathway interactions; Persian Gulf; Population; public health relevance; Rattus; receptor expression; Receptor Signaling; Research; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; small molecule; Spinal Ganglia; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; Transfection; Up-Regulation; Veterans; Visceral; War; ","Mechanisms of Gulf War Illness","001477","SPLD","Special Emphasis - Research on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses ","","","02","","","",""

Following accidental injury or surgical trauma, patients in intensive care units often have high blood glucose levels, as well as high insulin levels, a symptom similar to the insulin resistance of Type 2 diabetes, even with no pre-existing symptoms of diabetes. However, little is known as to the basic reasons for this insulin resistance and the mechanisms of recovery. Skeletal muscle plays a central role in whole-body glucose metabolism.

Preliminar work is very promising, and Lassa-VSV is the first VSV variant we have found that generates no adverse neurological effect when injected into the brain, yet appears to completely kill the brain tumor.

Thus, an increased focus on developing novel Sz therapeutics targeting these deficits is highly warranted and important to the VA and Sz field. Evidence suggests that agents facilitating activity of the type 5 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR5) have both antipsychotic and procognitive properties. However, the mechanism behind such effects is ill defined. Abnormal gamma band oscillations (GBO) represent a direct clinical correlate of Sz-related cognitive impairment, and provide a novel gateway for preclinical analysis of such drugs. The experiments proposed in this CDA use multilevel, state of the art, novel approaches including optogenetics, targeted viral expression, and both in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology to both define the role of mGluR5 in GBO development and maintenance, and assess the effects of mGluR5 modulation in models of Sz-like GBO abnormalities. This work will provide valuable insight for the development of agents improving cognition in Sz.","6569407; ","MCNALLY, JAMES M;","","04/01/2014","03/31/2019","Acoustic Stimulation; Acute; Address; Affect; Age; Agonist; analog; Animals; Antipsychotic Agents; Appearance; Area; Attention; Auditory; Autopsy; Behavior; Behavioral; Boston; Cells; Chronic; Clinical; Clinical Research; Cognition; Cognitive; Cognitive deficits; cognitive enhancement; cognitive function; cognitive process; Communities; Data; Development; disability; Disease; Doctor of Philosophy; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology (science); Etiology; Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists; executive function; experience; experimental study; extracellular; frontal lobe; Functional disorder; Funding; Generations; Glutamates; Goals; Hallucinations; Health Care Costs; Healthcare Systems; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; In Vitro; in vitro Model; in vivo; Individual; insight; interest; Interneurons; K-Series Research Career Programs; Ketamine; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Label; Link; Maintenance; Mediating; medical schools; Mental disorders; metabotropic glutamate receptor 2; metabotropic glutamate receptor 5; metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1; Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Motivation; Mus; N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors; neocortical; neural circuit; Neurons; neurotransmission; next generation; NMDA receptor antagonist; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; optogenetics; Outcome; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Physiologic pulse; Physiological; Play; Population; Positioning Attribute; positive allosteric modulator; Postdoctoral Fellow; postnatal; pre-clinical; preclinical study; Prefrontal Cortex; Property; protein expression; Psyche structure; Psychotic Disorders; public health relevance; Pyramidal Cells; receptor; Research; Resources; risk variant; Rodent; Role; Schizophrenia; Scientist; Short-Term Memory; skills; Slice; stem; Symptoms; Synapses; System; Testing; The Sun; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Training; Veterans; Viral; Viral Proteins; Work; ","Improving cortical function & cognition in schizophrenia by modulation of mGluR5","002130","NURB","Neurobiology B ","","","05","","","",""

Medin is a common protein that accumulates with aging and it can misfold and cause amyloid deposits (insoluble protein accumulation) in blood vessels. We are testing whether medin is associated with cognitive impairment in the elderly by measuring medin in the brain blood vessels of brain donors and relating it to tests of cognitive function.

Nearly half of patients diagnosed with diabetes - both type 1 and type 2 - suffer from diabetic retinopathy. The retina has one of the highest metabolic demands in the human body, and requires neuronal control of blood flow to maintain uninterrupted delivery of oxygen and other nutrients. From its onset, diabetic retinopathy is characterized by the inability of blood supply to match neuronal demand. In the retina, most of these interactions take place at the level of capillaries, where specialized vascular cells adjust blood flow in response to neuronal signals. The goal of this project is to determine how the altered interactions between these vascular cells and neurons lead to disrupted blood flow control in diabetes. Altered retinal blood flow is an early consequence of the disease, and may contribute to the further complications in vascular health that occur as the disease progresses. Thus, determining deficiencies in blood flow control will help prevent and treat complications of diabetic retinopathy.","8699438; ","SAGDULLAEV, BOTIR T.;","SHEN, GRACE L","04/01/2016","03/31/2021","Acetylcholine; Address; Amacrine Cells; Blindness; Blood capillaries; Blood flow; Blood Vessels; Caliber; Cell physiology; Cells; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Characteristics; Chemical Stimulation; cholinergic; Cholinergic Agonists; Cholinergic Antagonists; cholinergic neuron; Complications of Diabetes Mellitus; constriction; Coupling; Data; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetic; Diabetic mouse; Diabetic Retinopathy; Diagnosis; Disease; Electric Stimulation; functional decline; Functional disorder; Gap Junctions; Goals; Health; Human body; Impairment; Individual; Ion Channel; Lead; Light; Measures; Mediating; Metabolic; Mus; Neurons; neurotransmission; Neurotransmitters; new therapeutic target; Nutrient; optogenetics; Oxygen; Pathogenesis; Patients; Pericytes; Permeability; Play; prevent; public health relevance; Regulation; response; Retina; retina blood vessel structure; Retinal; Role; Signal Transduction; Spatial Distribution; stem; Testing; Tracer; Translating; Vascular blood supply; Vascular Diseases; Vascular Endothelial Cell; Vasodilation; Vasomotor; Visual impairment; ","Vascular control in diabetic retinopathy","026576","DPVS","Diseases and Pathophysiology of the Visual System Study Section ","","","03","250000","225000","475000",""

The population over 65 will increase to ~87 million by 2050. Age alone is the greatest risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of neurodegeneration. With no prevention or treatment, individuals with AD could reach 11-16 million by 2050; healthcare costs for AD alone were estimated at $200 billion in 2012. With this growing Veteran population is an increase in chronic health conditions, and social and financial burdens. Interventions that enhance endogenous pro-growth signaling may evoke neuroplasticity in the AD brain and improve motor and cognitive function in the Veteran population. The proposed research will attempt to use a novel approach to enhance neuronal growth by overexpressing caveolin levels in neurons in combination with already existing pharmacological interventions. As such, the research has direct clinical relevance to the long-term health of our Veterans.  ","8624433; ","HEAD, BRIAN P;","","04/01/2017","03/31/2021","Adult; Age; age related; age related neurodegeneration; aged; Aging; aging brain; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease model; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Attenuated; axon growth; Axonal Transport; Behavior; Behavioral; behavioral outcome; Brain; Brain Diseases; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; caveolin 1; Caveolins; Cell membrane; cell motility; Cells; Chemicals; Cholesterol; Chronic; clinically relevant; Cognitive; cognitive function; combat; Communication; Comorbidity; Complementary DNA; Cues; Cyclic AMP; Dendritic Spines; Dopamine; Dopamine Receptor; Electrophysiology (science); Event; Exercise; Exercise Therapy; experimental study; extracellular; Fright; functional plasticity; gene therapy; Genes; Genetic; Growth; Growth Cones; Growth Inhibitors; Health; Health Care Costs; Healthcare Systems; Hippocampus (Brain); Human; Image; improved; In Vitro; in vitro Model; in vivo; Individual; induced pluripotent stem cell; Intervention; Lead; Learning; Link; Maintenance; Mediating; Membrane; Membrane Lipids; Membrane Microdomains; Memory; Mental Depression; middle age; Molecular Target; Morbidity - disease rate; Morphology; Motor; mouse model; multimodality; Mus; Natural regeneration; Nerve; Nerve Degeneration; Nerve Growth Factor Receptors; nerve injury; nerve stem cell; neurite growth; Neuronal Differentiation; neuronal growth; neuronal guidance; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; neurotransmission; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutic intervention; overexpression; Parkinson Disease; Peptides; Pharmacology; Population; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; Prevention; promoter; Publications; Publishing; Quantum Dots; receptor; receptor expression; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Receptor Signaling; Research; reuptake; Risk Factors; Scaffolding Protein; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Seminal; Serotonin; serotonin receptor; Signal Transduction; small molecule; social; Sphingolipids; Synapses; Synapsins; Synaptic Receptors; synaptogenesis; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Trauma; Traumatic Brain Injury; Veterans; Vietnam; Work; ","Caveolin-mediated neuronal signaling in differentiated adult human neuronal stem cells and the aging brain","003671","NURD","Neurobiology D ","","","02","","","",""

Depending on the geographical location, a large subset of people with HAND are illicit substance users. The current antiretroviral treatments, while able to prevent or control AIDS, are largely ineffective against most forms of HAND. There is an urgent need to better understand the biology of this disease, the contribution of illicit substance use to it, andto identify interventions to prevent or treat HAND. Using an HIV designed to infect mice and finding that this infection causes early and persistent neurocognitive disease in infected animals (called mouse HAND) that resembles mild HAND in humans, this program proposes and tests specific biochemical routes through which an HIV-infected individual has learning or memory problems and how morphine or heroin might further exacerbate these problems. The majority of experimental studies will be done in mice either in tests of behavior/learning or in brain tissue analysis to investigate the biochemical mediators proposed in this program to act in cognition and learning. As key mediators are identified in mice, their levels and expression will be examined in archived brain tissues from patients (stratified by illicit substance use) who died with HAND, to determine relevance of these findings to human disease. Finally, based on the results obtained, as important checkpoints of mild HAND are characterized over the course of this program, specific intervention strategies, some using existing pharmaceuticals, will be tried in infected mice to prevent or ameliorate HIV brain disease. We hope these studies will increase our knowledge base on HAND pathogenesis, including in people regularly using illicit substances, and provide guidance for developing treatments in infected people.","1871302; ","VOLSKY, DAVID J;","POLLOCK, JONATHAN D","04/01/2014","03/31/2019","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; adaptive immune response; Alcohol or Other Drugs use; Animal Model; Animals; Anti-Retroviral Agents; antiretroviral therapy; Antiviral Agents; antiviral immunity; Archives; base; behavior test; Benign; Biochemical; Bioinformatics; Biology; biomarker panel; Brain; Brain Diseases; Brain Injuries; Brain Pathology; brain tissue; calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; Cells; ChIP-seq; chromatin immunoprecipitation; chromatin remodeling; Chronic; Clinical; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Cognitive; Data; Dementia; design; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease Marker; Dose; efficacy testing; Epigenetic Process; experimental study; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Gene Silencing; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Geographic Locations; Goals; Heroin; histone modification; Histones; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder; Human; human disease; Immune; immune function; Immunity; Immunocompetent; Immunologics; Immunology; Impaired cognition; implantation; Individual; Infection; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; innovation; Intervention; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; knowledge base; learned behavior; Learning; Link; Lysine; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Memory; Methylation; Modeling; Molecular; Morphine; Mus; Mutant Strains Mice; Natural History; Neurocognitive; Neurocognitive Deficit; Neuropathogenesis; neuropathology; novel; Opiate Addiction; Opioid Receptor; opioid use; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; patient stratification; Patients; Performance; Pharmacologic Substance; Pharmacology; Physiological; Placebos; Potassium Hydroxide; pre-clinical; prevent; Process; programs; promoter; public health relevance; Recovery; Refractory; Research; Role; Route; seroconversion; Site; Specificity; Substance abuse problem; success; Symptoms; Synapses; synaptic function; Synaptic plasticity; System; Systemic infection; Systems Biology; targeted treatment; Testing; Tissues; treatment strategy; Variant; Viral reservoir; viral transmission; virology; Virus; ","Threshold of Cognitive Impairment after HIV Infection: Effect of Morphine","037611","ZDA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","467164","324679","791843",""

The results from this project have potentially wide implications of great significance to the population cared for by the Department of Veteran Affairs and by the fact that six Parkinson's Disease Research, Education and Care Centers (PADRECCs) currently are funded (one here at the Portland VA Medical Center), to carry out clinical research projects focusing on Parkinson's disease.","9356677; ","MESHUL, CHARLES KENNETH;","","10/01/2009","03/31/2019","1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; Acute; Address; Affect; Age; aged; Agonist; Animal Disease Models; Animal Model; Animals; Area; Bilateral; Brain; Caring; Cell Death; Cells; Clinical Research; Corpus striatum structure; Cre-LoxP; Deep Brain Stimulation; Disease; Dopamine; dopaminergic neuron; Education; excitotoxicity; extracellular; Fiber; Frequencies; Funding; Gene Deletion; Gene Targeting; General Population; Genes; Glutamates; Goals; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Human; Hydroxydopamines; immunoreactivity; Incidence; Infusion procedures; Intervention; Investigation; Label; Lesion; LoxP-flanked allele; Measures; Medical center; Motor; motor deficit; motor function improvement; Movement Disorders; Mus; Nerve; Neurons; neuroprotection; neurorestoration; Neurotoxins; nigrostriatal pathway; Parkinson Disease; pars compacta; Pharmacology; Phosphotransferases; Population; public health relevance; receptor; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; recombinase; Research; Research Priority; Research Project Grants; restoration; Role; STN stimulation; Structure of subthalamic nucleus; Substantia nigra structure; Synaptic Vesicles; Technology; Toxin; Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase; uptake; vesicular glutamate transporter 2; Veterans; ","Role of the subthalamic nucleus and TrkB following dopamine loss","000552","NURE","Neurobiology E ","","","08","","","",""

The effective prevention and treatment of alcoholism remains one of our most difficult mental health problems. Alcohol-related disorders have consistently been diagnosed in a large proportion of VA hospital patients. In a study of male veterans (n=539,557) treated at VA medical centers during a one-year period, nearly 1/4 had a substance-related diagnosis; of those, 88% were diagnosed as alcoholic. Female and male veterans also have much higher prevalence rates than the general population for alcohol dependence.

The failure rate of therapy, and low survival rate of PDA patients remain a challenge and thus there is a critical need for novel therapeutic approaches, especially targeted to specific signals in the tumor cells. Protein kinases have been considered as among the most important targets in cancer and other diseases. We have discovered for the first time, that a protein kinase MLK3 is highly active in PDA and is involved in the activation of an oncogene, Pin1 that finally activate a well- recognized oncogene, Gli1 in PDA. Thus, we propose to determine the role of MLK3-Pin1-Gli1 axis in animal models of PDA, and to examine the application of MLKs and Pin1 inhibitors, as potential therapeutic approach for PDA treatment.

More than 90% of patients are women. Our research is investigating why lupus has a predilection for women. Rare human medical conditions in which there are additional X chromosomes have been highly informative. Men should have one X and women should have 2. However, men with 2 X chromosomes are at the same lupus risk as women, and women with 3 are at an even higher risk for lupus. So, we think that the risk of lupus is related to the numbe of X chromosomes, not sex. The proposal will investigate this idea, including an attempt to identify the gene responsible for this effect. Lupus is a common illness among otherwise healthy young adults. Thus, lupus is frequently diagnosed among military personnel and leads to a medical discharge in most individuals.

The aims of this study are designed to identify how stress alters the medial prefrontal cortex leading to a dysfunctional brain circuit (determined by real-time modulation with optogenetic techniques) that modulates chronic stress-induced pain. These findings may also identify targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies directed at the brain, specifically the limbic areas of the brain, to improve the treatment or even reduce the risk for the development of chronic stress- induced pain in veterans.

Women have up to twice the risk of PTSD as men (7). Compelling research on sleep and PTSD indicates that abnormal sleep plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of the disorder (8-10). Increasing evidence also indicates that sleep may impact memory for emotionally upsetting material (6, 11), and that women may have better memory for upsetting material than men (12-14), findings of major relevance to PTSD. Unfortunately, our understanding of the neurobiology of PTSD-related sleep disturbance is derived from studies of male, or predominantly male, samples (15). This creates profound barriers to understanding PTSD in women (12, 16-18). Increasing numbers of women are serving in the military, and are exposed to combat and potentially traumatic life events (19).

We will investigate the function of SMN in motoneuron development by focusing on its interactions with protein RNA complexes. This will lead to an understanding of the disease process and inform therapeutic approaches.","1911465; ","BEATTIE, CHRISTINE E;","NUCKOLLS, GLEN H","04/01/2017","03/31/2021","Adult; Affect; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Axon; Binding Proteins; Biochemistry; Biology; cell type; Cells; Cessation of life; Child; Childhood; Complement; Complex; Data; Data Set; Defect; Dendrites; design; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; experience; experimental study; Failure; Functional disorder; Genetic; Growth; Hereditary Disease; Human; imaging genetics; Immunoprecipitation; in vivo; Infant; infant death; Inherited; innovation; insight; Lead; link protein; Metabolism; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Motor; motor neuron function; Motor Neurons; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; Nature; nerve supply; Neurons; Neuropathy; Neurosciences; novel; novel strategies; Paralysed; Phenotype; polarized cell; Positioning Attribute; Problem Solving; Process; protein complex; Proteins; Research; RNA; RNA Processing; RNA Transport; RNA-Binding Proteins; Role; Skeletal Muscle; SMN protein (spinal muscular atrophy); Spectrophotometry; Spinal Diseases; Spinal Muscular Atrophy; synaptogenesis; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; trafficking; transcriptome sequencing; Transgenic Organisms; Western Blotting; Zebrafish; ","Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) function in motoneuron development","098780","NCF","Neurogenesis and Cell Fate Study Section ","","","02","221070","118376","339446",""

Although serum autoantibodies and tests of beta cell function remain the gold standard to identify at-risk patients, it is important to find alternative biomarkers that may be expressed at an earlier time point. These biomarkers can potentially predict AA+ progressors from non- progressors, be used to identify rate of progression, and can aid in patient selection and inclusion in intervention trials. Our preliminary data suggest that there are gene expression signatures in whole blood that might serve as such biomarkers. Additionally, as we enter the era of disease prevention studies in T1D, it is important to try and identify gene expression signatures of responder vs non-responder phenotypes to assist in drug selection.

Experiments outlined in this proposal will study the mechanism of how GDNF regulates hepatic steatosis. These experiments will not only contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of regulation of hepatic steatosis, but may also lead to new therapeutic targets for its prevention and treatment.

There are no effective treatments for GWI, and it is critical that we continue to explore mechanisms through which toxic exposures can evince such chronic effects. We have developed a mouse model that exhibits lifelong CNS dysfunction after exposure to agents known to have caused GWI.

PAH is caused by constriction of the inner diameter of pulmonary arteries and arterioles, leading to restricted blood flow in the arteries of the lungs. In turn, the heart mst work harder to push blood through the narrowed pulmonary arteries. As a result, the heart becomes dangerously enlarged, and patients die of heart failure. Current anti-PAH drugs are not very effective, require intravenous and subcutaneous injections, multiple inhalations or oral administrations a day, expose the whole body to the drug, reduce systemic blood pressure, and precipitate cardiac arrest. We propose to develop a highly innovative system for combination therapy for PAH; this system will deliver two drugs directly to the pulmonary arteries, reduce systemic exposure of drugs, reverse heart dysfunction, eliminate the need for catheters and needles, enhance patient compliance, ease economic burdens, free patients from discomfort, and cure the underlying causes of this deadly disease.","8576614; ","AHSAN, FAKHRUL ;","XIAO, LEI","04/01/2015","03/31/2019","Abate; Address; Adverse effects; Affect; Age; analog; Antioxidants; Area; arterial remodeling; Arteries; arteriole; Attenuated; base; bench to bedside; Blood; Blood Circulation; Blood flow; Blood Vessels; Breathing; Caliber; Cardiac; Cardiomegaly; Cardiovascular system; Catheters; Cause of Death; Cell model; Chemicals; Clinical; Combined Modality Therapy; Compliance behavior; constriction; Cor pulmonale; Cuprozinc Superoxide Dismutase; Cyclic Peptides; Dangerousness; Data; Development; Devices; Disease; Disease Progression; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Exposure; Drug Kinetics; Economic Burden; Edema; effective therapy; efficacy testing; Encapsulated; Endothelin Receptor Antagonist; Ethnic group; fasudil; Formulation; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Gender; Goals; Half-Life; Heart; Heart Arrest; Heart failure; hemodynamics; Homing; Hypoxia; improved; Individual; Indwelling Catheter; Infusion procedures; Ingestion; Inhalation Drug Administration; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; Interruption; Intravenous; intravenous administration; intravenous injection; kinase inhibitor; Laboratories; Lesion; Life; Ligands; Liposomes; liver injury; Lung; Medical; mimetics; Modality; Molecular; Monocrotaline; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Myocardial dysfunction; nanocarrier; nanoparticle; nanoparticulate; Needles; Newborn Infant; Oral; Oral Administration; Organ Model; Oxidative Stress; particle; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Peer Review; Peptides; Peripheral; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Pharmacotherapy; phosphodiesterase V; pre-clinical; pressure; prevent; Prostaglandins I; public health relevance; Publications; pulmonary arterial hypertension; Pulmonary artery structure; Pulmonary Circulation; Quality of life; Race; Rattus; Records; Rho-associated kinase; Rodent Model; Route; Safety; Scientist; SOD2 gene; SU 5416; subcutaneous; Subcutaneous Injections; Superoxide Dismutase; Superoxides; Surface; Symptoms; System; Systemic blood pressure; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic Effect; Translating; uptake; Vascular remodeling; vasoconstriction; Vasodilation; Vasodilator Agents; Violence; Work; ","Targetable and Inhalable Nanoparticle Based Combination Therapy for PAH","114677","RIBT","Respiratory Integrative Biology and Translational Research Study Section ","","","04","272130","108167","380297",""

It may even disclose novel drug targets for effective anti-resorptive therapies. This would reduce the morbidity with aging and improve quality of life of the patient, as reduction in hip fractures, a debilitating symptom of osteoporosis, would reduce medical costs for patient care and human suffering of osteoporosis. Similarly, OA is a painful and debilitating disease of the joints and is also a major health problem for the VA and military populations.

Worse yet, the burden is expected to rise given the senescing Veteran population. Beyond age, other lifestyle factors make Veterans particularly susceptible to osteoporosis, including increased prevalence of smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity. Moreover, many Vietnam and Desert Storm Veterans were exposed to environmental fac- tors that put them at much greater risk for developing bone and joint disease. Another issue facing many re- turning Veterans is spinal cord injury (SCI) and other battlefield-related injuries resulting in neuromuscular im- pairment. Those conditions result in disuse-osteoporosis, and progress made in neuromuscular rehabilitation can be offset or even nullified by degenerative changes in the bone. We are working on exciting new ap- proaches to preserving bone mass, structure, and mechanical integrity in the presence of neuromuscular im- pairment, which we believe will have significant translational capacity to impaired and osteoporotic Veterans.","6137583; ","ROBLING, ALEXANDER G;","","04/01/2017","03/31/2022","Address; adjudication; Adverse effects; Afghanistan; Age; Age-Years; agent orange; Alcohol consumption; American; Antibodies; arthropathies; Award; base; Bed rest; Biochemical; Biochemistry; Biology; Biomedical Engineering; Body Weight; bone; Bone Diseases; bone disuse atrophy; bone health; bone loss; bone mass; bone metabolism; bone strength; Bone Tissue; Book Chapters; career; Data; Diagnosis; Dioxins; disability; Disease; disease-causing mutation; Dose; driving force; Drug usage; Endocrinology; Ensure; Environmental Risk Factor; Event; Exposure to; FDA approved; Fracture; Future; Genes; Genetic; genetic linkage; Genome; Glucocorticoids; Goals; Health; Healthcare; Herbicides; Home environment; Homing; Hormonal; human disease; Hyperostosis; Impairment; improved; Inflammation; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; insight; Investigation; Iraq; Journals; lifestyle factors; long bone; Measurement; mechanical load; Mechanical Stimulation; Mechanics; mechanotransduction; Mediator of activation protein; Medicine; member; Metabolic; Military Personnel; Minerals; Mission; Mus; Muscle; Musculoskeletal; Mutation; Natural immunosuppression; Nature; neuromuscular; neuromuscular function; neuromuscular rehabilitation; novel strategies; Osteoblasts; Osteocytes; Osteogenesis; Osteoporosis; osteoporosis with pathological fracture; Osteoporotic; Paper; Paralysed; Pathway interactions; Patients; Persian Gulf; physical inactivity; Plague; Play; Population; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; Predisposition; prevent; Prisoner; Process; programs; Property; Proteins; PTH gene; Publications; Publishing; Quantitative Trait Loci; receptor; Regulation; Rehabilitation therapy; Reporting; Research; response; Risk; Role; Scientist; Seminal; Serum; Services; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; skeletal; Skeleton; smoking prevalence; Soldier; Spinal cord injury; Stimulus; Structure; Techniques; Testosterone; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; therapy design; Time; translational medicine; Translational Research; Van Buchem disease; Veterans; Vietnam; War; wasting; WNT Signaling Pathway; Work; ","BLR&D Research Career Scientist Award Application","003783","RCSR","Research Career Scientist ","","","02","","","",""

Based upon observations by our group of differences in the energy production in immune cells of individuals with ASD, the development of a laboratory-based screening test to identify children at increased risk for ASD is proposed, which will potentially provide for earlier diagnosis confirmation, more informed treatment, and improved behavioral outcomes.","14967606; ","CHAMPAIGNE, KEVIN D;","GRABB, MARGARET C","04/13/2018","03/31/2020","10 year old; Age; age group; Age-Months; aged; Amino Acids; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism spectrum disorder; Autistic Disorder; B-Lymphocytes; base; behavior observation; behavioral outcome; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Blinded; Blood; Blood specimen; Blood Volume; Cell Count; cell immortalization; Cell Line; Cell Separation; cell type; Cells; Child; Clinical; clinical Diagnosis; Clinical Trials; cohort; commercialization; Communication impairment; cost; Data; design; Development; Developmental Delay Disorders; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Diagnostic tests; DSM-V; Dyes; Early Diagnosis; Early Intervention; Early treatment; Energy-Generating Resources; Evaluation; Gases; Goals; imaging modality; immortalized cell; Immune; immune activation; improved; Individual; individualized medicine; interest; intervention program; Interview; Investigation; Ions; Kinetics; Laboratories; Language; Lead; Legal patent; Leukocytes; lymphoblastoid cell line; Magnetism; Measures; Metabolic; Metabolic Pathway; metabolic profile; Methods; Miniaturization; Neurodevelopmental Disorder; novel; Oxidation-Reduction; Pathogenicity; Performance; Phase; Prevalence; Process; Production; Protocols documentation; prototype; Reciprocal Social Interaction; repetitive behavior; response; Risk; Sampling; Schedule; screening; Sensitivity and Specificity; Series; social skills; Specificity; Standardization; Subgroup; System; Techniques; Technology; Temperature; Testing; testing services; Time; Toddler; Treatment Efficacy; treatment planning; Tryptophan; United States; ","Development of an Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening Test based upon Metabolic Profiling of Fresh Blood Samples","115642","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","371711",""

It is currently known that the neurobehavioral symptoms (i.e., cognitive, emotional, and somatic) of pmTBI are more pronounced in the first few weeks of injury, but it is not known how long these symptoms should typically last. Standard neuroimaging techniques are not very sensitive to the diffuse injuries that occur following pmTBI. Therefore, we do not understand why these symptoms occur or why certain children recover whereas others do not. Children who remain symptomatic are faced with impairment in academic, interpersonal and social functioning, ultimately resulting in a reduced quality of life. A growing literature also suggests that repetitive traumatic events may result in long-term neuropsychiatric disturbances. Thus, developing biomarkers that are capable of tracking neurological change from the semi-acute to more chronic injury phases is a major public health objective. The current application will utilize state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques to quantify how diffuse injuries (e.g., gray matter, white matter and vascular) change during the dynamic course of pmTBI, and how they relate to neurobehavioral symptoms. This information is of vital significance for clinical decisions about injury severity and return to normal physical activity, as well as for ultimately developing treatments that target injury mechanisms rather than symptomatology.","8698443; ","MAYER, ANDREW ROBERT;","BELLGOWAN, PATRICK S F","07/01/2016","03/31/2021","18 year old; Academic achievement; Accident and Emergency department; Acute; Address; Adolescence; Affect; Animal Model; Animals; Attention; Biological Markers; Blood Vessels; Brain; Brain Injuries; cerebral atrophy; cerebrovascular; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Child; Childhood; Chronic; cingulate gyrus; Clinical; Clinical Data; clinical imaging; clinical predictors; Clinical Trials; clinically significant; Cognitive; cognitive function; cognitive recovery; cognitive testing; cohort; computerized; Confidence Intervals; Consensus; Corpus striatum structure; Data; Development; Diagnosis; diagnosis standard; Diffuse; Diffuse Brain Injury; Diffusion; Edema; Emotional; evidence base; Exhibits; experience; follow-up; Foundations; Future; Goals; Gold; gray matter; Gray unit of radiation dose; Growth; hemodynamics; Image; imaging modality; Impaired cognition; Impairment; Individual; Injury; Intelligence; Interpersonal Relations; Intervention; Knowledge; Lateral; Learning; Lesion; Literature; Measurement; Measures; mild traumatic brain injury; Modeling; nerve injury; Neurobehavioral Manifestations; Neurobiology; neuroimaging; Neurologic; Neuronal Dysfunction; neuropathology; neurophysiology; neuropsychiatry; new therapeutic target; Outcome; Parents; Parietal; Pathology; Patient Self-Report; Patients; Phase; Physical activity; Play; Post-Concussion Syndrome; Problem behavior; processing speed; Prognostic Marker; prospective; Public Health; Quality of life; Recovery; recruit; Research Design; Resolution; Rest; Risk; Role; Sample Size; Sampling; Severities; Social Functioning; Structure; symptomatology; Symptoms; Techniques; Thalamic structure; therapeutic biomarker; therapeutic target; Therapeutic Trials; therapy development; Time; tool; Trauma; traumatic event; Unconscious State; Water; white matter; white matter injury; X-Ray Computed Tomography; Youth; ","The Impact of Diffuse Mild Brain Injury on Clinical Outcomes in Children","098494","ANIE","Acute Neural Injury and Epilepsy Study Section ","","","03","362171","238895","601066",""

Sub-clinical vitamin C (ascorbic acid, ascorbate) deficiency is a widespread among veteran populations, particularly in the elderly. Ascorbate depletion can accelerate several of the degeneration processes involved in Alzheimer's disease through specific oxidative stress pathways. We propose a novel pathway that highlights the role of ascorbate release in the glutamate clearance mechanism by astrocytes. Thus ascorbate deficiency can uniquely contribute to glutamate toxicity during hyperexcitability events, i.e. seizures. Better understanding of this mechanism will lead to improvement treatment plans and therapeutic targets both in Alzheimer's disease and in other cases in which seizures are common that may also reflect glutamate clearance problems, including following Traumatic Brain Injury.","1877106; ","MAY, JAMES M.;","","04/01/2017","03/31/2021","abeta accumulation; Acute; Aging; Agonist; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease model; Amyloid beta-Protein; Animal Model; Animals; Antioxidants; ascorbate; Ascorbic Acid; Astrocytes; Atherosclerosis; Behavioral; Blood; Brain; brain tissue; care costs; Caregivers; Ceftriaxone; Cell Death; Chronic; Clinical; clinically relevant; Coculture Techniques; Cognitive; cognitive ability; cognitive function; Comorbidity; Coupled; Culture Media; Culture Techniques; Data; Deterioration; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; Disease; DNA Sequence Alteration; Dose; Elderly; Electroencephalography; Ensure; Epilepsy; Equilibrium; Event; excitotoxicity; experimental study; Exposure to; Extracellular Fluid; Failure; familial Alzheimer disease; functional outcomes; Glutamates; Goals; Gulo; Health; Home environment; Human; Impaired cognition; improved; Intake; Investigation; Kainic Acid; Lead; Liver; Measures; Messenger RNA; Mitochondria; Modeling; Modification; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; Nerve Degeneration; neuronal survival; Neurons; neuropathology; neurotoxic; novel; outcome forecast; oxidative damage; Oxidative Stress; Oxidative Stress Pathway; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; patient population; Pattern; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Population; Predisposition; presenilin-1; Prevalence; Prevention strategy; Process; Production; Property; Proteins; Quality of life; Reactive Oxygen Species; relating to nervous system; Rodent; Rodent Model; Role; Seizures; Severities; Signal Transduction; Smoking; Speed; Supplementation; Synapses; synaptic failure; System; tau Proteins; Telemetry; Testing; therapeutic target; Toxic effect; Traumatic Brain Injury; treatment planning; Up-Regulation; uptake; Veterans; Wireless Technology; ","Failure of the glutamate uptake-ascorbic acid exchange drives seizure susceptibility and severity","001610","NURD","Neurobiology D ","","","02","","","",""

Thus, additional therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to reduce vision loss associated with these disorders. The long-term objective of this proposal is to provide mechanism-based therapeutic interventions that successfully combat degenerative retinal diseases. Systems pharmacology holds promise as a safe and highly efficacious therapeutic approach for such disorders. Using this novel approach, we aim to identify therapeutic agents that slow or halt the development and progression of retinopathies in animal models as a prelude to their clinical evaluation in humans.","9300152; ","PALCZEWSKI, KRZYSZTOF ;","AGARWAL, NEERAJ","07/01/2017","03/31/2022","Ablation; Adenylate Cyclase; Affect; Age related macular degeneration; Agonist; analytical method; Animal Model; antagonist G; Antibodies; Avastin; base; Basic Science; bevacizumab; Biochemical Process; biological systems; Blindness; Canis familiaris; Cell Death; Cell Survival; Cells; Clinic; Clinical Treatment; Clinical Trials; combat; Combined Modality Therapy; Complex; Cone; Cyclic AMP; Data; design; Development; Disease; Dose; drug candidate; Drug effect disorder; Drug Industry; Drug Kinetics; Dysplasia; Effectiveness; Engineering; Ensure; environmental stressor; Evaluation; Event; Exhibits; Exudative age-related macular degeneration; Eye; FDA approved; flexibility; Foundations; Future; G-Protein-Coupled Receptors; Gene Expression; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Goals; high resolution imaging; Human; imaging modality; improved; Institutes; interest; Intervention; Knock-in Mouse; Knock-out; Laboratories; Light; Link; Lucentis; Lysosomes; Medical; Medical center; Messenger RNA; Michigan; MicroRNAs; Modeling; Monitor; Monoclonal Antibodies; Monoclonal Antibody R24; mouse model; Mus; National Eye Institute; next generation sequencing; novel; novel strategies; Ocular Pathology; Ophthalmology; Outcome; overexpression; Partner in relationship; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacological Treatment; Pharmacology; Pharmacotherapy; photoreceptor degeneration; Photoreceptors; Physiology; prevent; Production; Property; protective effect; Proteins; ranibizumab; receptor; Research; research clinical testing; Research Personnel; restoration; Retina; Retinal; Retinal Cone; retinal damage; Retinal Degeneration; Retinal Diseases; retinal rods; Retinitis Pigmentosa; Safety; screening; Second Messenger Systems; Secondary to; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; small molecule; Specificity; Stargardt's disease; Structure; Structure of retinal pigment epithelium; success; successful intervention; System; targeted treatment; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; Therapeutic antibodies; Therapeutic Intervention; Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies; Toxic effect; transcriptome; Translating; translational research program; Treatment Efficacy; Universities; Untranslated RNA; Validation; Vertebrate Photoreceptors; Vision Disorders; Visual impairment; Visual system structure; Washington; ","Use of systems pharmacology to prevent rod and cone photoreceptor degeneration","027283","ZEY1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","1128764","304821","1433585",""

Importantly, there are currently no therapeutic strategies that limit the growth of aneurysms, due in large part to a lack of understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease and progression. Since the risk factors for AAA include advanced age, male sex, and tobacco use, it is not surprising that over 68,000 Veterans within the VHA suffer from AAA. Our preliminary data indicates that advanced age is associed with enhanced vascular inflammation and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease in preclinical animal models in association with decreased microRNA-24. We proposed to use a combination of molecular and physiological models to clarify the underlying mechanism of how miR-24 can regulate AAA formation.

These prevalence rates, along with 1) the finding that insomnia is a significant risk factor for relapse in abstinent alcoholics and 2) the existence of effective treatments for insomnia, suggests that targeted treatment for insomnia in this population is warranted. The questions that arise at this juncture are 'can standard insomnia treatments be applied to patients with alcoholism' and 'does successful treatment of insomnia have positive reciprocal effects on the comorbid alcoholism (e.g., greater rates of abstinence)?' The proposed study seeks to provide preliminary answers to these questions by evaluating the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) in alcoholics. If it is found that CBT-I produces good clinical effects with respect to insomnia and influences the clinical course of the alcoholism, this will suggest that insomnia treatment in general should be a standard component in the management of alcoholism.","11102221; ","CHAKRAVORTY, SUBHAJIT ;","","01/01/2014","12/31/2018","Abate; Abstinence; Address; Aftercare; Age of Onset; alcohol craving; Alcohol dependence; alcohol misuse; Alcoholism; alcoholism therapy; Alcohols; Anxiety; anxiety symptoms; awake; Back; Beck depression inventory; binge drinking; Biological Markers; Clinical; clinical effect; clinically significant; Cognitive Therapy; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; craving; daily functioning; Data; depressive symptoms; desensitization; design; diaries; Disease remission; drinking; Drowsiness; effective therapy; Electroencephalography; Equipment and supply inventories; Evaluation; Exhibits; experience; falls; Family; Family history of; Fatigue; follow-up; gabapentin; General Population; Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Genetic; Goals; Health; health related quality of life; Heavy Drinking; Hour; Hygiene; Impairment; improved; Incidence; indexing; Individual; Intervention; Investigation; Laboratories; Maintenance; male; Measures; Mental disorders; Military Personnel; Modality; modifiable risk; Moods; Neurobiology; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Participant; Pathologic; Patients; Performance at work; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Phenotype; Placebos; Population; post intervention; Prevalence; Primary Health Care; primary outcome; problem drinker; Protocols documentation; Psychophysiological Insomnia; public health relevance; Questionnaires; Randomized; recidivism; Recording of previous events; Recovery; Recurrence; Regimen; Relapse; relapse risk; Replacement Therapy; Research; Risk; Risk Factors; Sampling; secondary analysis; Severities; Severity of illness; Sleep; Sleeplessness; sobriety; Stimulus; targeted treatment; Testing; Time; TimeLine; Training; trait; Trazodone; treatment adherence; treatment effect; Treatment outcome; treatment response; trend; Veterans; Withdrawal; ","The Efficacy of CBT-I in Alcoholics & Its Effects on Remission & Relapse","000855","NURA","Neurobiology A ","","","05","","","",""

Obesity, diabetes and NAFLD/NASH are also extremely common problems in the VA population. From the liver standpoint the most important unanswered question is what causes the development of progressive NASH in a subset of patients with NAFLD that can ultimately lead to cirrhosis. Treatments for NASH cannot be designed rationally until the pathogenesis of NASH is better understood. Our research will demonstrate that hepatic cholesterol crystals are a hitherto unrecognized cause of NASH, leading to NLRP3 activation in hepatocytes and KCs and aggregation of KCs into CLSs and propagating the sterile inflammation and fibrosis that characterize NASH. We propose studies that span the translational spectrum from cell cultures and mouse models to human NASH. In addition to improving our understanding of NASH pathogenesis, our research will test novel therapeutic approaches targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome.","8615691; ","IOANNOU, GEORGE ;","","04/01/2017","03/31/2021","Age; Animal Model; Atherosclerosis; biobank; Cell Aggregation; Cell Culture Techniques; Cells; Characteristics; chemokine; Cholesterol; Chronic; Cirrhosis; Coculture Techniques; Crystallization; cytokine; Data; Dental crowns; design; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; Dietary Cholesterol; Dietary Fats; Epidemic; Ethnic Origin; experimental study; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Fatty Liver; Fibrosis; Fire - disasters; Freezing; Gender; Genes; Genetic; Hepatic; Hepatocyte; hepatoma cell; HepG2; High Fat Diet; Histologic; Human; hypercholesterolemia; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammasome; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; Intake; Interleukin-1 beta; Knockout Mice; Kupffer Cells; Lead; Lipids; Liver; macrophage; Mediating; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; Obesity; Oral; Pathogenesis; patient subsets; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Population; Prevalence; prevent; Process; Production; public health relevance; Race; recruit; Reporting; Research; Resolution; Risk Factors; Role; Specimen; Sterility; Structure; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; translational pipeline; uptake; ","Cholesterol lights the fire of NASH","002910","GAST","Gastroenterology ","","","02","","","",""

The primary objectives of this proposal are to identify new plasma protein biomarkers for COPD, to determine the genetic determinants of these protein biomarker levels, and to integrate the protein biomarkers and genetic determinants of both COPD and COPD protein biomarkers to diagnose COPD and COPD subtypes, to predict COPD disease progression, and ultimately to evaluate treatment efficacy. Identification and investigation of novel protein biomarkers may lead to new insights into the biological mechanisms causing COPD, suggest new pathways for treatment, and provide tools to select subjects for future clinical trials of COPD medications.","9598433; 1861123 (contact); ","MORITZ, ROBERT L.; SILVERMAN, EDWIN K (contact);","POSTOW, LISA","04/12/2017","03/31/2021","Address; African American; base; Biological; Biological Markers; Blood Circulation; caucasian American; CCL18 gene; Characteristics; chest computed tomography; Chronic Airflow Obstruction; Chronic Disease; Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease; cigarette smoking; Clinical Pharmacology; Clinical Trials; clinically relevant; clinically significant; Data; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; disease heterogeneity; disease phenotype; Disease Progression; Disease susceptibility; disorder subtype; drug development; drug efficacy; Environmental Risk Factor; Epidemiology; Extracellular Protein; Future; Genetic; genetic analysis; genetic association; Genetic Determinism; Genetic Heterogeneity; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; genetic variant; genome sequencing; genome wide association study; Genomic Segment; Heritability; Heterogeneity; Image; insight; Investigation; Lead; Lung; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Measures; Minority; Not Hispanic or Latino; novel; novel therapeutics; Outcome; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physiological; Plasma; Plasma Proteins; Play; Population; protein biomarkers; Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics; Public Health; Pulmonary Emphysema; Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein D; Reporting; Resistance; Respiratory physiology; Role; Sample Size; Sampling; Secretory Cell; secretory protein; Smoker; Smoking; Structure of parenchyma of lung; Syndrome; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissue Sample; tool; Treatment Efficacy; whole genome; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","COPD Susceptibility, Heterogeneity, and Progression:  Proteomics and Genetics","133135","IRAP","Infectious Diseases, Reproductive Health, Asthma and Pulmonary Conditions Study Section ","","","02","771533","133667","905200",""

Adipose tissue is an abundant, easily obtained and renewable source of stem cells. Adipose derived stem cells (ADSC) release nanovesicles (exosomes) that, when applied to dermal wounds, stimulate the endogenous repair mechanisms for healing. Wounds heal in about 21 days in healthy patients. Aging increases this time. This research is compromised, however, by the lack of clinical grade exosomes. We propose to improve the packaging of essential factors into exosomes, and develop methods to increase their secretion so that they can be applied to hard to heal wounds in elderly and diabetic patients, to soldiers in field hospitals, emergency rooms, and supplied for home wound care.

The incidence of IPF increases with age and is more common in males compared to females. Little is known about the development of IPF in humans, but cigarette smoking and environmental dust exposure, both common among US veterans, constitute two established risk factors for disease development. In addition, recently deployed military persons exposed to burn pits and pollutants may also have an increased risk of IPF as they age. Thus, patients in the VA health care system are expected to have a higher rate of IPF than the general population, establishing a major potential health issue facing US veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs has recently acknowledged this serious risk to US veterans and is currently enrolling patients for the Rehabilitation of IPF Patients clinical trial.

Based on our preliminary studies, we propose that HCV may cause premature T cell aging by up-regulating senescent markers such as KLRG1/DUSP6 through inhibiting miR155, dampening appropriate T cell responses to vaccinations during chronic infection. This project aims to explore how the expressions of these negative signaling molecules are regulated and interplay in CD4 T cells; and whether controlling these inhibitory pathways affects immune (vaccine) responses in HCV- infected patients. Understanding this mechanism is important for developing effective approaches to improve vaccine responses in chronically infected individuals, especially for veterans with HCV and/or HIV infection.

Our present study proposes to use a combination of molecular, biochemical and imaging techniques, electrophysiologic studies as well as molecular modeling to define the molecular and subcellular regulation of Ca2+ channels in ventricular myocytes and pacemaking tissues. Understanding the regulation of Ca2+ channels in the heart will set the stage for a new and more mechanistic approach for the therapy of cardiac arrhythmias and pacemaking cell dysfunction, a common problem encountered in our VA population.

GRB7 amplification and over-expression contribute to the aggressive behaviors of breast cancer. Study of GRB7 signaling will reveal why breast cancer with GRB7 over-expression is a more aggressive disease and lead to development of novel targeted therapy. GRB7 amplification and over- expression has been described in 20-25% of gastro-esophageal (GE) junction cancer. Though of lower incidence, GE junction cancer is a much more lethal disease than colon or prostate cancer and its incidence is rapidly climbing.

Failure of a kidney transplant to function is referred to as Delayed Graft Function (DGF), which occurs in up to 50% of kidney transplants and is a public health concern for Veterans. DGF results in a 40% decrease in long-term kidney transplant survival. Kidney transplant failure returns a Veteran to the waiting list, where potential recipients die every 18 minutes awaiting a transplant.

Dopamine released from these neurons assists in the learning of goal-oriented behaviors and it mediates the pleasurable effects of drugs of abuse such as morphine and amphetamine. Understanding how the excitability of VTA neurons is regulated is crucial if one is to understand mechanisms that control dopamine release. 5'-Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master enzyme that regulates cellular metabolism. Preliminary data from our lab suggest that activators of AMPK reduce VTA neuronal excitability by inhibiting glutamate synaptic input while increasing the function of inhibitory membrane properties.

We have discovered a new gene, ABCB5, which identifies stem cells in human and mammalian limbus. This discovery has allowed us, for the first time, to purify limbal stem cells for transplantation and to successfully restore the cornea in LSCD. The current proposal builds upon these results to address important challenges that currently remain in achieving more universal success of cell therapy for patients with unilateral or bilateral LSCD. Specifically, we hypothesize that ABCB5+ limbal stem cells isolated and expanded ex vivo can be used as a source of autologous or allogeneic stem cells to regenerate the corneal epithelium and restore vision in patients with either unilateral or bilateral LSCD.","8148663 (contact); 7554725; 1879572; ","FRANK, MARKUS H.
