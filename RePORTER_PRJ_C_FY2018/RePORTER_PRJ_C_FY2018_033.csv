Thus, there is a significant need for novel vaccine technologies that can generate strong mucosal immunity. However, adjuvants are currently required to accomplish this. In addition, no truly effective and approved mucosal adjuvant currently exists. Therefore, the proposed studies focus on the development of a novel vaccine platform, which delivers vaccine antigens to the mucosa, can stimulate robust mucosal immune responses, and can do so in the absence of adjuvant. This vaccine platform will also be tested using a highly significant infectious disease model (Streptococcus pneumoniae). Most importantly, this work will lay the foundation for future testing and clinical development of this vaccine platform and its eventual use against an array of current, emerging, and re-emerging pathogens.  ","1865902 (contact); 6476017; ","GOSSELIN, EDMUND J (contact); ZHU, XIAOPING ;","DAVIDSON, WENDY F","05/11/2018","04/30/2020","Adjuvant; Antigen Presentation; Antigen Presentation Pathway; Antigen Targeting; Antigens; Attenuated; B-Lymphocytes; base; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biology; Brain; Chimeric Proteins; clinical development; Complex; Data; Development; Dose; Epithelial Cells; experience; Foundations; Francisella tularensis; Future; Health; Histologic; Human; Immune response; Immunity; Immunization; immunogenic; immunogenicity; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Infection; infectious disease model; Inflammatory; innovation; Lung; Lymphoid Tissue; M cell; Measures; Mediating; mouse model; Mucosal Immune Responses; Mucosal Immunity; mucosal site; mucosal vaccination; mucosal vaccine; Mucous Membrane; Mus; neonatal Fc receptor; Nose; novel; novel vaccines; pathogen; Perception; Peripheral; pneumococcal surface protein A; prevent; protective efficacy; protein transport; Proteins; Publishing; Recombinants; Regimen; response; Route; Safety; Serum Albumin; Streptococcus pneumoniae; T cell response; T-Cell Activation; T-Lymphocyte; Technology; Testing; trafficking; Transgenic Mice; Vaccination; Vaccine Antigen; vaccine development; vaccine efficacy; vaccine evaluation; Vaccine Research; Vaccines; Variant; Viral; Work; ","Development of an adjuvant-free mucosal vaccine platform via sequential FcRn-mediated transepithelial Ag transport to the NALT and Fc RI-enhanced Ag processing and presentation within the NALT.","139733","VMD","Vaccines Against Microbial Diseases Study Section ","","","01","190563","62000","252563",""

PPI has thus emerged as an attractive target space for drug development. Despite the wealth of PPI data, however, the mechanisms by which complex cellular PPIs are exquisitely coordinated and regulated are still poorly understood, which hampers development of specific drugs targeting PPI. We have recently discovered that membrane lipids directly and specifically regulate cellular PPI. This important new discovery not only provides new insight into to how cellular PPI is regulated with high spatiotemporal specificity but also opens exciting new avenues of developing drugs targeting lipid-protein binding interfaces. Given the general and fundamental importance of PPI, our pioneering, innovative research should have high potential impact on broad areas of biology and medicine.","1883077; ","CHO, WONHWA ;","NIE, ZHONGZHEN","04/01/2017","03/31/2022","Area; Binding Proteins; Biology; Cancer Etiology; cell growth regulation; Cell membrane; Cell physiology; Cells; Cholesterol; Complex; Data; Development; drug candidate; drug development; Drug Targeting; Eukaryotic Cell; human disease; Imaging technology; In Situ; innovation; insight; Lipids; Malignant Neoplasms; Medicine; Membrane Lipids; Phosphatidylinositols; protein complex; protein protein interaction; Proteins; public health relevance; Regulation; Research; Signal Transduction; Signaling Protein; small molecule; spatiotemporal; Specificity; src Homology Region 2 Domain; System; ","Lipid regulation of cellular signaling and protein-protein interactions","122530","ZGM1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","391316","218276","609592",""

Recent epidemiological studies reveal disturbing associations between lack of exercise and increased incidence of certain cancers. Moreover, in children, there is an unparalleled epidemic of obesity clearly related to declining levels of physical activity early in life. The potential role of exercise as therapy has gained steady acceptance among health care professionals and the general public. But a mechanistic understanding of how exercise works in specific diseases and conditions is still lacking. Without knowledge at this level, rational and appropriate uses of exercise will remain imprecise, and the effectiveness of physical activity as a means to benefit human health may be lost. How can we best train the next generation of scientists in this area who must specialize in order to compete successfully in their individual scientific endeavors, but generalize in order to translate laboratory discoveries into solutions of real problems of human health? One approach is a training program that emphasizes both integrative and translational themes. Hence, we have created a unique training program that consists of four main elements. The first is a strong commitment to an integrative and translational approach that focuses on key issues related to exercise science. This is evidenced by the interactions across our Molecular Physiology and Systemic Physiology Cores. Second, we have world renowned Program Faculty who have well-funded on-going research programs, which will provide the fellows with rich research experiences. Third, we have developed a robust Education Core that consists of: i) a unique Formal Didactics Program; ii) an innovative Clinical Application Core that gives postdoctoral fellows extensive clinical experience; and iii) an enhanced emphasis on responsible conduct of research.

In our preliminary data, we find that nitrite (NO2-) can be bioactivated in skeletal muscle to activate mitochondrial SIRT3-AMPK- Glut4 signaling pathways to improve glucose homeostasis and the metabolic syndrome and reverse experimental PH-HFpEF. We have completed critical human phase 1 safety and proof of concept clinical trials of oral and inhaled nitrite therapy. For the next phase of support, we plan to study the mechanisms underlying the development of PH-HFpEF in the setting of metabolic syndrome.

In particular, contact dermatitis (CD) is a substantial health problem, which, as result of increased exposure to skin sensitizers in modern domestic and working environments, has escalated across age and gender differences. A recent joint study by the Society of Investigative Dermatology and the American Academy of Dermatologists concludes that the prevalence of allergic CD is 18% Allergic CD is the second highest cause of work-related diseases in the USA and an annual cost of in the USA up to 1.4 billion dollars. The onset and relapses of CD involve neuro-immunologic networks not addressed by current therapies. In this project we designed a therapeutic strategy that considers recent advances in immunology, neurology, and bioengineering. We will test a of a newly engineered neuro-immune regulation device based on a delivery platform unique to our laboratories. Our therapeutic system integrates a highly regulated skin-targeting strategy to inhibit CD and other antigen specific chronic inflammatory skin disorders. Importantly, our approach includes translational studies focusing on human skin that are specifically designed to enable rapid translation to clinical trials.","1860503 (contact); 7113695; ","FALO, LOUIS D (contact); LARREGINA, ADRIANA T;","CIBOTTI, RICARDO","07/07/2015","04/30/2020","Academy; adaptive immune response; age difference; Allergic Contact Dermatitis; American; Anatomy; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; antigen challenge; Antigen Presentation; Antigen-Presenting Cells; antigen-specific T cells; Antigens; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmune Process; base; Biomedical Engineering; C Fiber; CD8B1 gene; Cell physiology; Cells; Cellular Immunity; Chronic; chronic inflammatory skin; Clinical Trials; Contact Dermatitis; cost; Cutaneous; Data; Defense Mechanisms; Dermatologist; Dermatology; Dermis; desensitization; design; Development; Devices; Disease; dosage; Drug Delivery Systems; Engineering; Environment; Epidermis; Event; experimental study; Exposure to; gender difference; Generations; Goals; Haptens; Health; Homing; Human; Immune; Immune System Diseases; Immunity; Immunization; Immunology; Immunosuppression; in vivo; Incidence; Inflammation; Inflammatory; innovation; Investigation; Joints; Laboratories; Langerhans cell; Leukocytes; Link; Maintenance; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Memory; Modeling; Modernization; Mus; Nervous system structure; Neuroimmune; neuroinflammation; Neurology; Neuropeptides; novel; novel strategies; Painless; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Penetration; Phase; PPBP gene; Prevalence; prevent; Prevention; Prevention therapy; Process; progenitor; Proteins; public health relevance; Publications; Publishing; Receptor Activation; recruit; Regulation; Relapse; relating to nervous system; response; Role; Sensory; sensory mechanism; Signal Transduction; Skin; skin disorder; small molecule; Societies; socioeconomics; Substance P; Substance P Receptor; Suggestion; System; T cell response; T memory cell; T-Cell Development; T-Lymphocyte; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Effect; therapy development; Time; translational approach; translational study; Translations; Vaccination; Work; ","Manipulating Cutaneous Neuroimmunity to Treat Contact Dermatitis","068249","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","255930","138202","394132",""

The aim of this Program Project 'Gene Mutation and Rescue in Human Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia' is to 1) identify gene variants in patients with Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia from genomic sequencing and structural variant analyses, 2) test high priority candidates for validation and function in vitro and ex vivo, and in animal models, 3) determine molecular pathways defined by integrating already known and new candidate genes, and 4) select molecular targets from which to conceive postnatal treatment strategies for CDH. 40% of CDH patients have multiple anomalies in addition to CDH, but as many as 60% are isolated with the potential for increased survival if we can improve the associated lung hypoplasia responsible for its high morbidity. The societal and individual burden of CDH can hopefully be lessened by reducing the patient and family stresses caused by the considerable morbidity and mortality, as well as the cost of care, coincident with this birth defect. Steps that we employ herein can serve ultimately as a template to address other polygenic congenital anomalies and treatment strategies conceived for CDH can have broader applications in the care of children with the bronchopulmonary dysplasia of prematurity.","6093730; 1890713; 1879833 (contact); 9859995; 7350091; 10041135; 11103520; 6855188; 3105607; ","BULT, CAROL J; CHUNG, WENDY K; DONAHOE, PATRICIA K (contact); HANSEN, KASPER LAGE; HIGH, FRANCES ARIANWEN; LONGONI, MAURO ; SHEN, YUFENG ; SUN, XIN ; WILSON, JAY M;","HENKEN, DEBORAH B","08/29/2011","04/30/2022","Address; Affect; Alveolar; Animal Model; Biopsy; Blood Vessels; Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia; Candidate Disease Gene; candidate validation; care costs; Child; Child Care; Clinical; clinically relevant; cohort; comparative genomic hybridization; Congenital Abnormality; congenital anomaly; Congenital diaphragmatic hernia; Copy Number Polymorphism; Data; Defect; Diaphragmatic Hernia; Dysbarism; Evaluation; exome sequencing; Extended Family; Family; Frequencies; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; gene function; Gene Mutation; Genes; Genetic; genetic variant; Genomics; Goals; hemodynamics; Heterogeneity; Human; human genome sequencing; improved; In Vitro; Individual; Live Birth; Lung; Membrane; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Target; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Neonatal Intensive Care Units; novel; Parents; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Perinatal Care; perinatal intervention; Phenotype; postnatal; premature; Program Research Project Grants; programs; Research; Respiratory Diaphragm; reverse genetics; Sequence Analysis; Somatic Mutation; Stress; Structure of parenchyma of lung; Surface; Survivors; Technology; Testing; treatment strategy; Variant; ","Gene Mutation and Rescue in Human Diaphragmatic Hernia","068250","ZHD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","07","1329452","339603","1669055",""

This lack of knowledge prevents rationale development of clinical strategies to prevent fractures in those with diabetes.

Dysfunctional mineralization leads to a variety of medical problems and so an understanding of these processes is essential. The proposed studies are designed to understand the function of dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) in the biomineralization process. The mechanisms by which DMP1 functions in bone and teeth are poorly understood. The proposed experiments are designed to fill this gap. We identified that DMP1 can cause the release of calcium from intracellular stores. However, the mechanism by which DMP1 stimulation leads to store depletion and subsequent opening of Ca2+ permeable channels are not known. Store operated calcium entry is a key mechanism by which cells convey Ca2+ signals and maintain Ca2+ homeostasis. Dysregulated calcium entry is detrimental to osteoblasts and odontoblasts. We also identified novel DMP1 partners that can perform various functions in matrix mineralization Understanding the mechanism by which intracellular Ca2+ is regulated and identifying the function of DMP1 partners will have important implications in developing novel strategies for bone and dentin repair and regeneration.","1867555; ","GEORGE, ANNE ;","WAN, JASON","06/01/1996","04/30/2019","Apoptosis; Apoptotic; ATF6 gene; Binding; biological adaptation to stress; biomineralization; bone; Calcium; Calcium Channel; Cell membrane; Cell physiology; Cell surface; Cell Survival; Cells; Cleaved cell; Defect; Dentin; dentin matrix protein 1; design; Diagnosis; Disease; DSPP gene; Endoplasmic Reticulum; experimental study; extracellular; Extracellular Matrix; Extracellular Space; Funding; Genes; glucose-regulated proteins; Goals; GRP gene; Health; Heat shock proteins; Homeostasis; Human Development; Image; Ion Channel; knock-down; Knock-out; Lead; Mediating; Medical; Mesenchymal Differentiation; mineralization; Minerals; Molecular; mouse model; Natural regeneration; novel; novel strategies; Nuclear; Odontoblasts; Osteoblasts; Outcome Study; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Permeability; Phenotype; Play; Process; Proteins; public health relevance; receptor; Receptor Signaling; Recycling; release of sequestered calcium ion into cytoplasm; repaired; response; Role; sensor; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Small Interfering RNA; STIM1 gene; Stress; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; therapeutic target; Tooth structure; Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent; transcription factor; Transcriptional Activation; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Western Blotting; ","Characterization of DMP1 a Dentin Phosphoprotein","011657","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","20","250000","149750","399750",""

She is very dedicated to mentoring the next generation of patient-oriented clinical investigators. Dr. Costenbader's research and mentoring opportunities are enhanced by strong affiliations with research training programs at multiple Harvard teaching hospitals, Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health, as well as with national research and clinical organizations. The new research proposed on cardiovascular disease risks and outcomes among patients with lupus in the U.S. has enormous public health relevance. Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the U.S. and despite increased rates among lupus patients, relatively little is known about recent cardiovascular disease event and mortality rates among lupus patients across the U.S., about the types of medical and surgical cardiovascular disease care received, or about outcomes after cardiac procedures for cardiovascular disease. This line of investigations has the potential to provide extremely valuable public health information concerning cardiovascular disease risks and outcomes, and medical and surgical therapies delivered in recent years across the U.S. within a large, nationwide high-risk population. Given strong institutional commitment and resources, as well as her past success in training academic clinical researchers, this K24 will support an expansion of Dr. Costenbader's research and mentoring activities, producing important research findings and well-trained leaders in patient-oriented rheumatic disease research.","2052802; ","COSTENBADER, KAREN H;","WITTER, JAMES","05/15/2014","04/30/2019","Academic Training; Address; adverse outcome; Affect; Age; Area; Autoimmune Diseases; base; Biostatistical Methods; Cardiac; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular disorder risk; care outcomes; career; Caring; Cause of Death; Clinical; Clinical Investigator; cohort; Cohort Studies; Collaborations; Coronary Artery Bypass; Country; Data; Development; Disease; Disease Outcome; Educational process of instructing; Enrollment; Environment; Epidemiologic Methods; Epidemiology; epidemiology study; Ethnic Origin; Event; Feedback; Fellowship; Future; General Population; Grant; Health Insurance; Heart failure; high risk; high risk population; Hospitals; Hydroxychloroquine; improved; Inflammatory; Intervention; Investigation; Kidney; Knowledge; lectures; Lupus; Lupus Nephritis; Medicaid; Medical; medical schools; Mentors; Methotrexate; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Myocardial Infarction; Necrosis; next generation; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; Outcomes Research; patient oriented; patient oriented research; Patients; percutaneous coronary intervention; Peripheral Vascular Diseases; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacoepidemiology; Policies; Population; population based; Positioning Attribute; Postdoctoral Fellow; pre-doctoral; Procedures; programs; Public Health; public health relevance; Public Health Schools; Race; recruit; Relative Risks; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; research study; Research Training; Resources; Rheumatism; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Rheumatology; Risk; sex; Socioeconomic Status; stroke; Subgroup; success; Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; Teaching Hospitals; Testing; Time; Training; Training Programs; Uncertain Risk; Variant; Vulnerable Populations; Woman; Work; young woman; ","Cardiovascular Disease Epidemiology in Medicaid Patients with Lupus","066109","AMS","Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Special Grants Review Committee ","","","05","162851","13028","175879",""

By occupying this receptor, PRG4 may decelerate the progression of inflammation in the synovium, caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1ß, which is elevated following a joint injury and in patients with osteoarthritis. This effect will in turn slow the rate of cartilage degeneration.

This project will examine the differences in carpal tunnel syndrome-related care across VHA medical centers during the time between diagnosis and surgery, and further understand the factors that are associated with delay of surgery and higher numbers of healthcare visits. These findings will guide the development of organizational changes to help clinicians provide higher quality and efficient care for patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, with the goal of promoting Veteran-centered care and improving patient outcomes.

Thiopeptides are natural products that act on Mtb and they are distinguished from standard antibiotics in having dual (bacterial and host) effects that could synergize to eliminate Mtb. The poor aqueous solubility of thiopeptides has prevented their development into TB drugs. We propose to make thiopeptide analogs with improved solubility and optimized dual activities.

We have shown that HBV alters glucose metabolism and energy-sensing signal-transduction pathways in hepatocytes, which could reset the metabolic baseline profile of hepatocytes to favor HBV replication. We will test the hypothesis that this metabolic reset sensitizes hepatocytes to cellular sensors, thereby affecting cell signal transduction pathways that could influence HCC development.","8185560; ","BOUCHARD, MICHAEL J.;","KOSHY, RAJEN","05/09/2018","04/30/2020","Address; Adenosine Monophosphate; Affect; alcohol exposure; Alcohols; Area; Biology; Catabolic Process; cell growth; Cell Proliferation; Cells; Charge; Chromosomal Stability; Chronic; Chronic Hepatitis B; Complex; Development; Disease Progression; Environment; Equilibrium; experience; Exposure to; Foundations; FRAP1 gene; Generations; genetic regulatory protein; Genetic Translation; glucose metabolism; Goals; HBXIP gene; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B Virus; Hepatocyte; high risk; Homeostasis; Human; Immune; in vivo; Infection; Inflammatory Response; interest; Link; Lipids; Liver; Lysosomes; MAP Kinase Gene; Mediating; Messenger RNA; Metabolic; Metabolic Pathway; Metabolism; Names; novel; Nucleic Acids; Nucleotides; Nutritional; Oncogenic; Organ; Pathogenicity; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physiology; Positioning Attribute; Primary carcinoma of the liver cells; Process; Production; Protein Biosynthesis; Protein Kinase; Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Recurrence; Regulation; response; Role; sensor; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Signal Transduction Pathway; Starvation; Stress; stressor; synergism; Testing; Time; Toxin; Translation Process; Translations; tumorigenesis; Viral; Viral Genome; Viral Interference; Viral Proteins; Virus; Virus Diseases; Virus Replication; ","Consequences of HBV modulation of metabolic homeostasis in human hepatocytes","138143","HBPP","Hepatobiliary Pathophysiology Study Section ","","","01","150000","82127","232127",""

However, 15%-27% of renal transplant patients have ARTR within 5 years, which if not detected and treated promptly, causes renal damage and leads to renal failure of the transplanted kidney.

In patients with head and neck cancer, xerostomia (severe dry mouth) is a debilitating side-effect of RT that adversely affects quality of life in these patients. However, clinical evaluation of xerostomia involves patient-based or physician-based grading systems that are subjective and prone to error and variability. Building on novel and encouraging preliminary observations, in this application, we propose to examine usefulness of a relatively new optical imaging technique for non-invasive assessment of salivary gland function and radiation-induced salivary gland injury in vivo.

This strategy often results in reduced drug availability and action specifically at the clo site, while causing systemic non-specific drug action leading to severe hemorrhagic side effects. Hence we propose to investigate an innovative strategy of targeted thrombolytic therapy strategy where the drug will be packaged within platelet-inspired particulate vehicles that can specifically anchor onto clot sites and allow localized release of the drug for therapeutic action selectively at the clot site, thereby making the therapy potentially more efficient and safe compared systemic thrombolysis.","8963554; ","SEN GUPTA, ANIRBAN ;","OCHOCINSKA, MARGARET J","09/01/2015","04/30/2019","Adverse effects; Affect; Aftercare; Albumins; Alteplase; aqueous; base; Binding; biomaterial compatibility; Blood flow; blood flow measurement; Blood Platelets; Blood Vessels; Caliber; Carotid Artery Thrombosis; Catheters; Cations; Charge; Chromogenic Substrates; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Research; Coagulation Process; controlled release; Cues; density; design; Drug Delivery Systems; drug distribution; Drug effect disorder; Drug vehicle; Embolism; Engineering; Excision; Fibrinogen; Fibrinolytic Agents; flexibility; Fluorescence Microscopy; Goals; Half-Life; hemodynamics; Hemorrhage; high risk; Imagery; In Vitro; in vitro testing; in vivo; in vivo Model; Injectable; Injury; innovation; Integrins; interest; intravital microscopy; Ischemic Stroke; Isoelectric Point; Kinetics; Label; Ligands; Mechanics; Mediating; microscopic imaging; mimetics; Modeling; Modulus; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Myocardial Infarction; P-Selectin; P-selectin ligand protein; particle; Particulate; Pathology; Peptides; Perfusion; Peripheral arterial disease; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Physiological; Plasma; Plasminogen Activator; Platelet aggregation; prevent; Procedures; Property; public health relevance; receptor; Research; restoration; Risk; Shapes; Site; spatiotemporal; Spectrophotometry; stem; stroke; Surface; System; targeted treatment; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; thrombolysis; Thrombolytic Therapy; Thrombus; Tissues; Treatment Efficacy; Vascular Diseases; ","Platelet-inspired Delivery System for Targeted Thrombolytic Therapy","129179","BMBI","Biomaterials and Biointerfaces Study Section ","","","04","277914","162580","440494",""

The challenge is to be able to simultaneously detect the activity and stimulate individual axons from the exterior of the nerve i.e. an approach that is non-invasive yet has specificity. We believe we can use optogenetics and Multiphoton microscopy with electrowetting scanning lens technology to achieve this goal. Use of genetically encoded optical proteins (or optogenetics) as tools to stimulate neurons and readout electrical activity is rapidly developing in Neuroscience. Multiphoton microscopy can stimulate or image an optical protein/dye and when combined electrowetting lens can be made small enough for this application to allow us to image deep into a nerve.","1901403; 9808611; 7586913 (contact); ","CALDWELL, JOHN H; GIBSON, EMILY ; WEIR, RICHARD FERGUS FFRENCH (contact);","QASHU, FELICIA M","09/24/2016","07/31/2018","Action Potentials; aerobic respiration control protein; Afferent Neurons; Alpha Cell; Axon; base; Beta Cell; bioimaging; Biological; Brain; Breeding; Caliber; Cardiac; Cervical; cholinergic; Collaborations; Coupled; design; Detection; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Autonomic Neuropathy; Efferent Neurons; Event; experience; experimental study; Fascicle; Fiber Optics; fluorescence imaging; Fluorescent Dyes; Generations; Glucagon; Goals; Head; Heart; Heart Rate; Hormones; Human; Image; imaging system; Implant; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; instrument; Insulin; insulin secretion; islet; Islets of Langerhans; Label; Langerhans cell; Lasers; lens; Measures; member; Methods; Microscope; Microscopy; minimally invasive; Mus; Muscle fasciculation; Nerve; nerve supply; Neurons; neuroregulation; Neurosciences; novel; optical fiber; optical imaging; Optical Instrument; Optical reporter; Optics; optogenetics; Organ; Pancreas; Pancreatic Diseases; pancreatic juice; Parasympathetic Nervous System; Pathway interactions; Peripheral Nerves; Peripheral Nervous System; Physiological; portability; Preparation; protein expression; Proteins; Ranvier's Nodes; Reporter; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; response; rhodamine dextran; Scanning; Sensory; Signal Transduction; Site; Source; Specificity; Stimulus; System; Technology; Testing; Tissues; tool; Transgenic Mice; two-photon; Vagus nerve structure; Viral Vector; Viscera; Work; ","Development of a Bidirectional Optogenetic Minimally Invasive Peripheral Nerve Interface with Single Axon Read-in & Read-out Specificity","023852","NGTT","Next Generation Tools and Technologies ","","S3","01","161659","51388","206047",""

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a highly effective and safe treatment for improving sleep and pain outcomes, yet is severely underutilized among patients with chronic pain. Evidence suggests that even if patients with chronic pain initiate CBT-I, they have difficulty adhering to treatment recommendations due to pain-specific barriers. The proposed research focuses on increasing demand and optimizing CBT-I delivery for patients with chronic pain. We expect that findings will have a broad impact on CBT-I dissemination and adherence, as well as adherence to cognitive behavioral therapies in general.

We will investigate the hypothesis that the mineralocorticoid hormone, aldosterone regulates the expression of specific miR clusters in the distal kidney nephron cortical collecting duct (CCD), to alter Na+ transport by targeting the expression of the scaffold protein intersectin-2. Using in vivo mouse models we will establish the regulation of miRs in the principal cells of the CCD. The significantly regulated miRs that are altered by aldosterone and other signaling pathways linked to sodium regulation will be determined. We hypothesize that different signaling cascades may regulate miRs differently to produce a miR signature so that a unique signaling response can be elicited for each. We will alter the expression of the miR-23~24~27 clusters to demonstrate its importance in maintaining sodium balance in the kidney. Finally the mechanism of intersectin-2 regulation of the epithelial sodium channel will be determined, to characterize the involvement of this novel aldosterone-repressed protein in Na+ regulation in the kidney.","8082444; ","BUTTERWORTH, MICHAEL B;","KETCHUM, CHRISTIAN J","05/01/2015","04/30/2020","Address; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Aldosterone; Angiotensin II; Area; Cells; Collaborations; Collecting Cell; Cortical Nephron; CYP11B2 gene; Development; Diet; Disease; Distal; Duct (organ) structure; Ductal Epithelial Cell; Electrolytes; epithelial Na+ channel; Epithelium; Equilibrium; Family; Foundations; Future; Genomics; Homeostasis; Hormonal; Hormones; human disease; Hypertension; Hypotension; in vivo; intersectin 1; Intervention; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Link; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; MicroRNAs; Mineralocorticoid Receptor; Mineralocorticoids; Modeling; mouse model; Nephrons; novel; Pathway interactions; Phosphorylation; Physiology; Positioning Attribute; Potassium; Proteins; Pseudohypoaldosteronism; public health relevance; Recycling; Regulation; Regulatory Pathway; Reporting; response; Role; Scaffolding Protein; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Sodium; Sodium Chloride; Syndrome; Testing; trafficking; Transgenic Organisms; Untranslated RNA; uptake; Work; ","Role of microRNAs in kidney sodium regulation","102843","KMBD","Kidney Molecular Biology and Genitourinary Organ Development ","","","04","225000","121500","346500",""

Due to advances in mechanical ventilatory and fluid strategies, the outcomes of ARDS patients have improved significantly over the last decade. The goal of this new NHLBI PETAL initiative is to test therapies that will either prevent the development of ARDS in patients at risk for developing the syndrome, or improve outcomes for patients with early ARDS. The University of Colorado Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care and Department of Emergency Medicine have previously collaborated on clinical initiatives including optimizing the transition of care for critically ill patients from the Emergency Department to the Intensive Care Units. In addition, investigators from each group have a long standing history of performing outstanding ARDS and critical care research, and conducting multi-center clinical trials. The overarching aims of the Colorado Clinical Center for the PETAL network will be: 1) To be an effective clinical center that achieves seamless coordination of care between Critical Care and Emergency Medicine and continues to exceed our contractual obligations to enroll patients; 2) To actively participate in the selection of the clinical trials to be performed by the PETAL network and to contribute to the subsequent responsibilities of the steering and other PETAL committees; 3) To improve the conduct of clinical trials by facilitating the Institutional Review Board process; 4) To maintain excellence and disseminate methodology to improve the quality of protocol compliance, data acquisition, and regulatory responsibilities across the PETAL network.","9565606; 8209180 (contact); ","GINDE, ADIT A.; MOSS, MARC  (contact);","REINECK, LORA A","06/17/2014","04/30/2021","Accident and Emergency department; Acute; Acute Lung Injury; Address; Admission activity; Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Affect; Alaska Native; Ally; American Indians; Area; base; Bilateral; care coordination; Caring; Case Series; Chest; Clinical; clinical care; clinical infrastructure; Clinical Medicine; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; Colorado; Conduct Clinical Trials; Consent; Country; Critical Care; Critical Illness; Data; data acquisition; Development; Early treatment; Emergency department visit; Emergency Medicine; Enrollment; experience; Extramural Activities; Fostering; Funding; Goals; Growth; Health; Hispanics; Hospitals; Hypoxemia; improved; improved outcome; Individual; Injury; innovation; Institutional Review Boards; Intensive Care Units; Intervention; Lead; Liquid substance; Lung; Manuscripts; Mechanics; Medical center; medical specialties; Medicine; member; Methodology; Methods; metropolitan; Mosses; multidisciplinary; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; Patient Care; patient oriented research; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Pneumonia; Positioning Attribute; prevent; Prevention; Prevention trial; Principal Investigator; Process; Protocol Compliance; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Publications; Publishing; Pulmonary Embolism; Recording of previous events; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; research study; Residencies; Resources; Risk; Rosa; Sampling; Science; screening; Seminal; Sepsis; Site; Symptoms; Syndrome; Testing; Time; Training Programs; Transfusion; United States; Universities; Work; ","Colorado PETAL Clinical Center","123010","ZHL1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","266617","106443","373060",""

More broadly, accessing MSM populations in the MENA region is quite challenging; Lebanon provides a unique opportunity to demonstrate the ability to recruit and engage this hard-to-reach population in HIV/AIDS prevention research.","1893992; ","HEIMER, ROBERT ;","WHITE, DELLA","06/22/2017","03/31/2019","Address; Affect; AIDS prevention; Alcohol consumption; Alcohol or Other Drugs use; American; Area; Behavior; Behavioral; Caring; Coercion; Communities; Country; Data; Data Analyses; Data Collection; Development; Discrimination; Disease; disease transmission; displaced person; Drug usage; Economics; Elements; Emergency Situation; Epidemic; Epidemiologic Monitoring; Event; experience; Future; Goals; Guidelines; Health Services Accessibility; Health Status; Healthcare; high risk; high risk sexual behavior; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV risk; HIV Seropositivity; HIV Seroprevalence; HIV/STD; Home environment; Household; Human immunodeficiency virus test; improved; Incidence; Income; Individual; Intention; International; Intervention; Interview; Lead; Lebanon; Life Experience; life history; Locales; Low Prevalence; men; men who have sex with men; Mental Health; Methods; Middle East; migration; Minority; Modeling; Muslim religion; Nationalities; Output; Participant; Patient Self-Report; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; physical abuse; Population; population based; Prejudice; Prevalence; prevent; Prevention; Prevention Research; prevention service; psychosocial; Public Health; Public Health Schools; Recommendation; Recording of previous events; recruit; Refugee Camp; Refugees; Research; Research Design; residence; Respondent; Risk; Risk Behaviors; Risk Factors; Role; Sampling; sex; Sex Behavior; sex risk; Sexual abuse; sexual minority; sexual relationship; sexual risk taking; social; Social Network; social stigma; socioeconomics; stem; Stigmatization; Stress; Structure; Surveys; Syria; Testing; testing services; therapy design; Time; treatment services; Tropical Medicine; Universities; War; Work; ","Addressing Disparities in HIV Testing and Care among Displaced MSM","089820","BSPH","Behavioral and Social Science Approaches to Preventing HIV/AIDS Study Section ","","","02","192546","34001","226547",""

The autonomic nervous system (ANS), which is part of the peripheral nervous system, innervates internal organs to modulate their function and transmit sensory information back to the CNS. By selectively stimulating the ANS nerves, neuromodulation of target organs can be achieved. Numerous therapeutic applications of neuromodulation are currently under investigation to relieve diseases and conditions. In-depth knowledge of neuroanatomy and real-time information on nerve health during surgical or neuromodulation procedures are essential for successful outcomes. In this project, we will develop a new optical imaging tool based upon intrinsic contrast measures obtained from optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography and polarization sensitive OCT. We will derive and validate three new biomarkers for stimulation effectiveness and nerve injury using the rat sciatic and ovarian plexus nerve. We will deploy multiple OCT systems to other SPARC investigators to expand the scope and potential applications that benefit from our optical imaging tool. A successful effort will transform the manner in which neuromodulation devices are assessed and deployed, leading to more effective therapies and better patient outcomes.","8644797; ","VAKOC, BENJAMIN JAMES;","QASHU, FELICIA M","05/10/2018","04/30/2020","Address; Advanced Development; Anatomy; Angiography; autonomic nerve; Autonomic nervous system; Back; base; Biological; Biological Markers; Blood flow; Blood Vessels; Complex; Computer software; Data Analyses; design; Devices; Disease; Distal; effective therapy; Effectiveness; Electric Stimulation; Ganglia; Goals; Health; Histology; Image; imaging biomarker; Imaging Device; imaging platform; imaging system; Imaging technology; Injury; innovation; insight; Investigation; Knowledge; Light; Link; Measures; Methods; Modeling; Monitor; Morphologic artifacts; myelination; Nerve; nerve injury; Nerve Plexus; Neuraxis; Neuroanatomy; neuroregulation; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; Optical Coherence Tomography; optical imaging; Organ; Outcome; Ovarian; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Peripheral Nerves; Peripheral Nervous System; Physiology; Procedures; Process; programs; quantitative imaging; Rattus; Research Personnel; Resource Sharing; response; Safety; Sensory; Structure; System; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; tool; tool development; Validation; Vasa Nervorum; Work; ","Novel optical coherence tomography tool development for quantitative peripheral nerve imaging","025306","NGTT","Next Generation Tools and Technologies ","","","01","347714","142284","489998",""

Emergency care access is particularly problematic for Veterans, in part because VA emergency departments (ED) are far and few between, and Veterans are often uncertain where to go when confronted with an emergency. This is particularly true for Veterans with special access issues, like those living in rural areas, those lacking housing, and women. We will assess capabilities and resources of VA EDs to care for acutely ill Veterans. Further, by analyzing ED data and speaking with Veterans, we will better understand where and why Veterans access the emergency care system (in both VA and non-VA settings) and will identify barriers in access amendable in future intervention and policy changes. Ultimately, our results are highly actionable to our operational partners and can be directly used to improve access to emergency care for Veterans during times of crisis.","11344073; ","VASHI, ANITA A;","","05/01/2018","04/30/2021","Accident and Emergency department; Accounting; Acute; Address; Advocate; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Area; base; Bypass; California; care seeking; care systems; Caring; Chest Pain; Chronic; cohort; Communities; Complex; contextual factors; cost; Country; Data; Data Analyses; Decision Making; design; Eligibility Determination; Emergency Care; Emergency department visit; Emergency Medicine; Emergency Situation; Enrollment; Ensure; Equipment and supply inventories; experience; Failure; Family; Fostering; Funding; Future; Gender; Glare; Government; Gunshot wound; Health; health care availability; health care service; Health Services Accessibility; Health system; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; Home environment; Housing; Improve Access; improved; innovation; Institute of Medicine (U.S.); Insurance; Intervention; Interview; Knowledge; Medical emergency; Medicare; Methods; Myocardial Infarction; Outcome; Patients; Phase; Policies; Population; preference; prevent; Primary Health Care; Provider; Qualitative Methods; Quality of Care; Reporting; Research; Research Infrastructure; Resources; rural area; rurality; safety net; Services; Structure; Surveys; System; Time; Translating; United States; Variant; Veterans; Visit; Wife; Woman; Work; ","Veteran Access to Emergency Care","002362","HSR5","HSR-5 Health Care System Organization and Delivery ","","A2","01","","","",""

Our cross-disciplinary research will have sustained impact on the fields of immune-regulation and signaling, as it will explore the role of a specialized complex that we hypothesize to exist in activated B cells and lupus B cells, by using novel genetically modified mouse strains, high-throughput screening of small molecule compounds and cutting-edge molecular biology, cell biology and imaging approaches. Our proposal, as also prompted by our recent findings showing the profound effect of a small molecule compound that targets a component of the complex in arresting disease development in a murine lupus model, is also highly translational, as it will lay the foundation for future studies that address the potential of the signaling mechanism as a novel therapeutic target in lupus and other NF-kB-mediated diseases.","10710806; ","XU, ZHENMING ;","JOHNSON, DAVID R","05/11/2018","04/30/2020","Ablation; activation-induced cytidine deaminase; Address; Adverse effects; Affect; Antibodies; Antibody Response; antigen binding; Antigens; Autoantibodies; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmunity; autoreactive B cell; B cell differentiation; B-Lymphocyte Subsets; B-Lymphocytes; Binding; Binding Sites; biochemical tools; Biological; CD40 Ligand; Cell physiology; Cell surface; Cells; Cellular biology; cellular imaging; Co-Immunoprecipitations; Complex; Data; Development; differentiated B cell; Disease; Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution; Dynamin; Elements; Endocytosis; Endosomes; Enzymes; experimental study; Foundations; Fractionation; Future; Gene Expression; Generations; Genetic; Genetic Recombination; Genetic Transcription; Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins; high throughput screening; Homeostasis; Human; IgE; IGH@ gene cluster; imaging approach; Immune; Immunity; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin Class Switching; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation; Immunologic Receptors; immunoregulation; Immunosuppressive Agents; Impairment; In Vitro; in vivo; Inbred MRL lpr Mice; Individual; Infectious Agent; Intracellular Membranes; Knock-in Mouse; Knock-out; knockout gene; Knockout Mice; Ligands; Light; Location; Lupus; Mediating; Membrane; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Biology; Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins; mouse model; Mouse Strains; MS4A1 gene; multiorgan damage; Mus; mutant; new therapeutic target; NF-kappa B; novel; Organ; Pathogenicity; Patients; Peripheral; Pharmacology; Play; Polyubiquitin; Polyubiquitination; Process; Production; Proteins; receptor; Receptor Signaling; Research; response; Role; screening; Signal Transduction; small molecule; small molecule inhibitor; Specific qualifier value; stem; Surface; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Therapeutic; TNFRSF5 gene; TNFSF5 gene; To specify; Toll-like receptors; TRAF6 gene; ubiquitin-protein ligase; Woman; ","Role of intracellular membrane signalosomes in B cell NF-kappaB activation","131034","CMIB","Cellular and Molecular Immunology - B Study Section ","","A1","01","150000","78750","228750",""

NARRATIVE: Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) is a common and highly lethal birth defect in which we have found pathogenic de novo gene variants present after whole exome sequencing in cohorts of affected probands but not present in unaffected parents. To prioritize these pathogenic variants for further study, we have screened each for expression in normal diaphragms and lungs during development. These high priority candidate gene variants will be used to create animal models of CDH using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Additional new genes causing CDH were found by screening embryos and newborns for diaphragm and lung defects after systematically disabling all cell mouse genes by CRISPR/Cas9 editing in the KOMP2 (Knockout Mouse Program) at The Jackson Laboratories. We will also use novel bioinformatic algorithms to detect protein interactors of these candidate genes to uncover molecular pathways or networks from which we can impute molecular targets for future therapeutics aimed at improving alveolarization in these CDH patients after birth. We will rescue aberrant phenotypes observed in our new mouse models created by gene editing using small molecules from screens customized to identify molecules which improve alveolarization (Project III).","1879833; ","DONAHOE, PATRICIA K;","","","","Address; Affect; Algorithms; Alveolar; Animal Model; base; Bioinformatics; Birth; Candidate Disease Gene; Cell Lineage; Cells; Clinical; clinically relevant; cohort; Collaborations; Congenital Abnormality; Congenital diaphragmatic hernia; cost; CRISPR/Cas technology; Custom; Data; Data Set; Defect; Deposition; Development; Diaphragmatic Hernia; Disease; Doctor of Philosophy; drug discovery; Embryo; essays; Evaluation; Exhibits; exome; exome sequencing; experience; Failure; Future; Gene Expression; Gene Mutation; Gene Targeting; General Hospitals; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; genetic variant; Genome; genome sequencing; genomic data; Genomics; Goals; Health; Histologic; Human; Human Genetics; Human Genome; human genome sequencing; Image; improved; In Vitro; in vitro Assay; in vivo; Intervention; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Life Expectancy; Link; Lung; Massachusetts; Medical; microCT; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Target; mouse model; multidisciplinary; Mus; mutant; Mutant Strains Mice; Mutation; Newborn Infant; novel; Organ Culture Techniques; Parents; Pathogenicity; Pathway interactions; Patient Care; Patients; Phase; Phenotype; phenotypic data; Population; postnatal; proband; programs; protein protein interaction; Proteins; pulmonary hypoplasia; pup; Research; Respiratory Diaphragm; Respiratory physiology; reverse genetics; Scientist; screening; septal defect; small molecule; Source; Technology; The Jackson Laboratory; Therapeutic; therapeutic candidate; therapeutic evaluation; Therapeutic Intervention; therapeutic target; Tissues; transcriptome; United States National Institutes of Health; Validation; Variant; ","Mouse Models Will Elucidate Genetics of CDH and Associated Pulmonary Defects and Identify Clinically Relevant Targets","068250","ZHD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","6225","","07","321432","360","","321792"

Approximately 70% of breast cancer patients test positive for estrogen receptor (ER) in their cancers. Estrogen promotes growth of tumors with estrogen receptor, so anti-estrogen therapy is frequently used to block tumor growth. Tamoxifen is an effective anti-estrogen therapy. Unfortunately, however, many patients experience resistance to Tamoxifen either at the beginning or after prolonged treatment. New strategies are needed that can overcome tamoxifen resistance and improve clinical outcome in these patients. We identified two closely related proteins, called PRCP and PREP,that can promote tamoxifen resistance and metastasis in breast cancer. We identified a chemical that can inhibit the activity of these two factors and reverse tamoxifen resistance. There are three goals in this grant: 1) to define how these two factors promote tamoxifen resistance and metastasis in breast cancer, 2) to test the potential that targeting these factors could enhance sensitivity of otherwise resistant breast cancers, and 3) to ask if high levels of these factors can be used to predict how well breast cancer patients respond to therapy.","1968099; ","MAKI, CARL G;","SCHWARTZ, ELENA IVAN","05/01/2016","04/30/2021","Address; Agonist; Antiestrogen Therapy; Archives; base; Breast Cancer Patient; Calcium; Calmodulin; cancer diagnosis; Cells; Chemicals; Cleaved cell; Clinical; Collection; Data; Development; Endocrine; Enzymes; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Estrogen receptor positive; Estrogen Receptors; Estrogens; experience; Family; Family member; Feedback; Female; FRAP1 gene; G Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling; G-Protein-Coupled Receptors; Genetic Screening; Goals; Grant; GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs; hormone therapy; improved; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; knock-down; lysosomal Pro-X carboxypeptidase; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammary Neoplasms; MCF7 cell; member; Metastatic breast cancer; Metastatic Neoplasm to the Lung; Modeling; Mus; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neuropeptides; Outcome; outcome forecast; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Patients; peptide G; Peptide Hydrolases; Phosphotransferases; PI3K/AKT; predictive marker; Premenopause; prevent; Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; public health relevance; Recurrence; Regulation; Resistance; Signal Transduction; Sirolimus; Specimen; survival outcome; Tamoxifen; targeted biomarker; Testing; therapeutic effectiveness; therapeutic target; therapy development; Tissues; tumor; tumor growth; tumor xenograft; Woman; ","Targeting Prolyl Peptidases in Tamoxifen Resistant Breast Cancer","200232","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","03","8190","4668","12858",""

Targeting these persistently infected populations requires an understanding of events that regulate and limit HIV infection and the establishment of latent infections. Experiments outlined in this proposal will utilize cellular and bioengineering approaches to directly address how cellular signals bias HIV infection towards productive infection versus latent infection. We expect that these studies will provide new insights into key regulatory networks that govern the establishment of HIV infection and persistence. Furthermore, understanding the minimal requirements for T cell signaling and HIV infection will potentially identify novel cellular targets which could be manipulated in an effort to alter the size of the latent reservoir and the course of HIV/AIDS progression.","1946225; ","HENDERSON, ANDREW J;","KUO, LILLIAN S","05/08/2018","04/30/2023","Acute; Adaptor Signaling Protein; Address; AIDS/HIV problem; Antigen Receptors; Biochemical Process; Biomedical Engineering; CD28 gene; Cell Cycle Progression; Cell physiology; Cells; cellular targeting; chimeric antigen receptor; Chromatin; Complex; Cytoskeleton; Data; Dendritic Cells; Engineering; Event; experimental study; Genetic Transcription; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Infection; innovation; insight; interdisciplinary approach; Interruption; latent infection; Lead; Ligands; Maps; Mediating; Molecular; Mutation; nanoparticle; novel; Pathway interactions; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Phosphotransferases; Population; Process; receptor; Receptor Signaling; recruit; Role; Signal Transduction; Structure; T-Cell Activation; T-Cell Receptor; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Time; tool; Transcription Elongation; transcription factor; transmission process; virological synapse; Virus; ","Signals that establish and maintain HIV latency","138960","AMCB","AIDS Molecular and Cellular Biology Study Section ","","A1","01","290031","185962","475993",""

Despite smoking-related mortality and morbidity among HIV-positive Veterans, smoking cessation research in this population is lacking. Among Veteran smokers with HIV, behavioral/pharmacological smoking cessation treatments are underutilized and furthermore may have low efficacy. The proposed CDA-2 projects use technology to optimize the reach and efficacy of smoking cessation treatment. The intervention (MESH: Mobile Contingency Management plus Evidence-Based Smoking Cessation for HIV-Positive Veterans) uses mobile health and telehealth technology to deliver a) individually personalized smoking cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy, b) behavioral reinforcement for abstinence, and c) relapse-prevention messaging.

The basis of essential hypertension is largely unknown, and current treatment strategies are suboptimal. This program of investigation will provide a new understanding of the adaptive kidney processes that limit the effectiveness of a widely used class of antihypertensive drugs, the thiazide diuretics, and translate this knowledge to drug discovery. Specifically, it examines how a salt gaining pathway is activated by the alpha-ketoglutarate receptor, OXGR1, in intercalated cells of the kidney when the thiazide- sensitive salt transport is inhibited, or when hypokalemic intravascular volume contraction occurs, as is commonly observed with vomiting or diarrhea. We expect these investigations will have a major impact on understanding how the kidney controls salt balance in health and disease, in ways that illuminate the central underpinnings of the variable diuretic response. Ultimately, these studies will provide new information and diagnostic tools that lead to the better treatment of hypertension.","1857949; 1898629; 1883547 (contact); ","DELPIRE, ERIC J; WALL, SUSAN MARIE; WELLING, PAUL A (contact);","KETCHUM, CHRISTIAN J","06/15/2017","04/30/2022","Ablation; absorption; Affect; Alkalosis; alpha ketoglutarate; Angiotensin II; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents; Apical; apical membrane; Bicarbonates; Biochemical; Biological; Blood Pressure; blood pressure reduction; Calcineurin; Calcium; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cells; Chlorides; Chronic Kidney Failure; cost effective; Data; Diagnostic; Diarrhea; Disease; Diuretics; drug discovery; Duct (organ) structure; Effectiveness; Electrolyte Balance; Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay; Essential Hypertension; Failure; G Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling; G-Protein-Coupled Receptors; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Genomics; Health; Hypertension; hypertension treatment; Hypokalemia; In Vitro; Intercalated Cell; Investigation; Kidney; kidney cell; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Lead; Light; Link; Liquid substance; Mediating; Medical; Metabolic; Molecular; Molecular Target; multidisciplinary; Mus; mutant; novel; paracrine; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Physiological; Physiology; Planets; Potassium; Process; programs; promoter; Public Health; Publishing; receptor; Recombinants; Renal function; Resistance; response; Role; salt balance; salt sensitive; Sodium Chloride; Stimulus; System; Systems Biology; Testing; Therapeutic Effect; thiazide; Thiazide Diuretics; tool; trafficking; Translating; Transport Process; treatment strategy; United States; urinary; Urine; Vomiting; wasting; Work; ","OXGR1 in Renal Intercalated Cells, Salt Transport and Diuretic Efficacy","110375","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","615970","84474","700444",""

Inappropriate tests may delay or limit access to patients with appropriate indications for testing. Reducing inappropriate testing could reduce costs and make funds available for other Veteran services. In this award, we propose a series of investigations to better understand why inappropriate tests are ordered, what the cost is to the VA system, and implement a system to reduce inappropriate tests.

Treatment for vocal fold scarring, a voice disorder caused by connective tissue or extracellular matrix injury or loss has been limited. Paucity of human vocal fold fibroblasts (VFF) has necessitated the pursuit of surrogate cells that can be exploited alone, in combination with scaffolds and/or growth factors for optimal therapeutic application. Efforts to differentiate embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells and fibroblasts from other parts of the body cells towards VFF lineage have been challenged by a lack of known factors that effectively induce and guide vocal fold ECM formation and few known benchmarks with which to assess VFF differentiation. In this application, we seek to identify and define vocal fold lamina propria pre-natal chemical and mechanical cues as well as their optimal combination that will be able to regulate guided differentiation of stem cells.","6969728; ","THIBEAULT, SUSAN ;","SHEKIM, LANA O","02/01/2000","03/31/2021","Adult; adult stem cell; Affect; American; Area; Attention; base; Benchmarking; Biochemical; Biocompatible Materials; Biology; Biomechanics; Biometry; Bioreactors; Body part; Cell Differentiation process; Cell physiology; Cells; cellular engineering; Chemicals; Chromosome Mapping; Cicatrix; Coculture Techniques; combinatorial; Communities; Connective Tissue; Cues; Data; Defect; Derivation procedure; design; Development; Developmental Biology; Embryo; embryo tissue; Embryonic Development; embryonic stem cell; Endoderm Cell; Engineering; engineering design; Extracellular Matrix; Fibroblasts; fibrogenesis; Frequencies; Funding; Gene Expression Profile; Gene Targeting; Genetic Transcription; genome-wide; Goals; Growth Factor; healing; Human; Hyaluronic Acid; Hydrogels; improved; induced pluripotent stem cell; Injury; innovation; Knowledge; Lamina Propria; Maintenance; Measures; mechanical load; mechanical properties; Mechanics; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Methods; Molecular; Motivation; multidisciplinary; Mus; Natural regeneration; Normal tissue morphology; Operative Surgical Procedures; Pathway interactions; Population; postnatal; prenatal; prevent; Primitive foregut structure; Process; progenitor; programs; Property; public health relevance; repaired; Research; scaffold; Scientist; sharing data; Signal Transduction; skills; Source; stem cell differentiation; Stem cells; Therapeutic; Tissue Engineering; tissue regeneration; Tissues; transcriptome; Treatment outcome; vibration; vocal cord; Voice Disorders; Work; Wound Healing; ","Engineering the Vocal Fold Extracellular Matrix","004336","MFSR","Motor Function, Speech and Rehabilitation Study Section ","","","19","403127","208251","611378",""

Of these a quarter of men and a third of women will experience fracture of the hip, forearm or spine by age 60 due to effete bone. In 2005, the mortality in the year following fracture in the US was 20 to 25% and is expected to quadruple by 2025. Therapies such as hormone replacement and bisphophonates are problematic, such that osteoporosis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts are normally coupled. Thus, old or weakened bone can be removed and replaced with strong new bone. Loss of estrogen at menopause leads to increased osteoclast numbers, and activation of pro-inflammatory T-cells in the bone marrow. The proposed studies will examine the role and mechanism used to counterbalance the activity of regulatory T-cells in inhibiting osteoporosis.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We have shown that regulatory T-cells of the CD8 lineage, called TcREG, can ameliorate osteoporosis in a mouse where menopause is initiated by ovariectomy. Here we propose experiments to understand how these cells are induced in vivo and how they limit bone loss. Insights from these experiments are likely to lead to new treatment modalities representing an entirely new and mechanistically distinct avenue than those currently in use or development for osteoporosis and other bone erosion diseases.","6607803; ","AURORA, RAJEEV ;","CHEN, FAYE H","04/01/2014","03/31/2019","Actins; Adoptive Transfer; Age; Antigen Presentation; Antigen-Presenting Cells; Antigens; Arthritis; Autoimmunity; base; bisphosphonate; bone; bone erosion; bone loss; Bone Marrow; Bone Resorption; bone turnover; Buffers; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8B1 gene; Cells; Chronic; Coupled; cytokine; Data; Development; Disease; Elderly; Equilibrium; Estrogen Replacements; Estrogens; experience; experimental study; Exposure to; Feedback; Forearm Fracture; Foundations; FOXP3 gene; Fracture; healing; Hip Fractures; Histocompatibility; Homeostasis; Hormones; IL2RA gene; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; Immunosuppressive Agents; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammatory; insight; Interferons; Interleukin-10; Interleukin-6; International; Knowledge; Lead; Lymphocyte; men; Menopause; Modality; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mus; novel; Osteitis; Osteoblasts; Osteoclasts; Osteogenesis; osteoimmunology; Osteoporosis; Ovariectomy; pathogen; Postmenopausal Osteoporosis; prevent; Process; Production; Proteins; public health relevance; Regulation; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; response; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Role; Serum; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; skeletal; Skeletal system; T-Cell Receptor; T-Lymphocyte; TNFSF11 gene; transcription factor; Vertebral column; Woman; ","A Negative Feedback Loop Between Osteoclasts and CD8 T-Cells","064821","SBDD","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section ","","","05","229127","118000","347127",""

This project pairs daily report of sleep duration, timing, and quality with 24-hour dietary recall reports and anthropometric measurements within a longitudinal study of children, allowing for the exploration of the daily, short- and long-term associations among variability in sleep health, diet and OW/OB risk.

Pathological pulmonary vascular remodeling occurs in subsets of patients in the setting of left heart diastolic dysfunction, the metabolic syndrome, and is a secondary event in advanced lung diseases. The development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in these settings is further modulated by host genetics, diet, and microbiome and the development of the most effective specific therapy likely requires dual targeting of the underlying conditions, such as metabolic syndrome and the pulmonary vascular sub-phenotype.

These studies address basic questions of how antibody genes are used during humoral immune responses and will help us understand how to fine tune vaccine development to ultimately provide the most efficient immune responses.","1878400; ","KENTER, AMY L.;","LIU, QIAN","05/09/2018","04/30/2020","Address; Algorithms; Antibodies; Antibody Repertoire; Antigen Receptors; Architecture; Area; B-Cell Development; B-Lymphocytes; base; Biological; Bone Marrow; Cell Line; Chromatin; Chromatin Loop; Chromatin Modeling; Chromatin Structure; chromosome conformation capture; Chromosome Structures; Chromosomes; Clonal Deletion; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Complex; Computer Analysis; Computer Simulation; computer studies; Data; Data Set; design; Development; Dimensions; Distal; Distant; DNA; Elements; Enhancers; Frequencies; Gene Expression; Gene Family; Gene Rearrangement; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Recombination; Genome; Genomics; IGH@ gene cluster; Immune response; Immunoglobulins; Individual; insight; Knock-out; Link; Lymphoid Cell; Mammalian Chromosomes; mammalian genome; Mediating; Methodology; Methods; Modeling; Molecular Conformation; Molecular Immunology; novel; Outcome; Polymers; Positioning Attribute; Process; progenitor; promoter; Receptor Gene; recombinase; Research Personnel; Resolution; response; Shapes; Site; spatial relationship; Stimulus; Stretching; Structure; Structure-Activity Relationship; Technology; Testing; theories; three dimensional structure; Three-dimensional analysis; TimeLine; tool; Transformed Cell Line; Translating; V(D)J Recombination; vaccine development; ","Deciphering high resolution Igh chromatin topologies and impacts on Ig repertoire","137865","CMIB","Cellular and Molecular Immunology - B Study Section ","","","01","150000","82971","232971",""

There is a critical need to develop strategies for training non-ID personnel to implement and sustain ASP activities. The research proposed in this application directly addresses this problem through three related studies. The first study will identify structural factors and processes associated with optimal facility-level antimicrobial-prescribing at VHA hospitals. The second study will determine barriers and facilitators to stewardship in facilities with ASPs lacking ID support. The third study will provide remote physician-mentorship to bolster ASP efforts at 2 hospitals lacking ID support.","10113007; ","LIVORSI, DANIEL ;","","10/01/2017","09/30/2022","Accident and Emergency department; Acute; Address; Antibiotic Resistance; antimicrobial; antimicrobial drug; Antimicrobial Resistance; Attitude; base; carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae; career; career development; Clinic; Clinical Research; Clostridium difficile; Collaborations; combat; Communicable Diseases; community living; Data; Data Analyses; Databases; design; Development; Development Plans; Dose; Effectiveness; Ensure; experience; Feedback; Fostering; Frequencies; Future; Goals; health administration; Health care facility; health care settings; Healthcare; Hospital Administration; Hospitals; Human Resources; implementation science; Improve Access; improved; Incidence; Infection; Inpatients; Intervention; intervention effect; Investigation; Investigator-Initiated Research; Knowledge; Measures; Medical; medical specialties; meetings; Mentors; Mentorship; Methods; Modeling; Multi-Drug Resistance; novel; novel strategies; Outcome; pathogen; Pathway interactions; patient safety; Patients; Performance; Pharmacists; Physicians; Prevalence; primary outcome; Process; programs; Protocols documentation; Provider; Pseudomonas; Public Health; Qualitative Research; Randomized Controlled Trials; Research; research and development; Research Methodology; Research Personnel; Research Proposals; Resources; Risk; secondary outcome; Series; Site; skills; Specialist; Surveys; Time; tool; Training; United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; Veterans; Work; ","Improving antimicrobial use at hospitals that lack infectious disease specialists","002281","CDA0","HSR&D Career Development Award  ","","A1","01","","","",""

Stem cell lineage decisions are strongly regulated by exercise and lack of exercise. Knowing how to use physiologic exercise to improve bone strength should be a goal of physician scientists, especially as the US population becomes more sedentary and obese. This project is built on our data showing that a critical mechanical signaling pathway prevents stem cells from becoming adipocytes, thus preserving stem cells for bone lineage. This signal pathway results in two effects: first ßcatenin is generated, and secondly, the cell's cytoskeleton is reorganized providing increased structure. We propose that ßcatenin, known to regulate MSC cell fate, requires a cytoskeletal context to effectively prevent adipogenesis and promote bone formation. The work proposed in this grant will elucidate synergism between ßcatenin and cytoskeleton, and will use a running mouse model to show that these pathways are important for exercise to promote skeletal health.","1897246; ","RUBIN, JANET E;","ALEKEL, D LEE","04/01/2015","03/31/2020","Actins; Adhesions; Adipocytes; Adipose tissue; Adult; AKT inhibition; base; beta catenin; bone; bone cell; Bone Formation Stimulation; bone fragility; bone health; Bone Marrow; bone strength; Cell Lineage; Cell Nucleus; Cells; Complex; Cytoskeletal Modeling; Cytoskeleton; Data; Exercise; F-Actin; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Focal Adhesions; Goals; Grant; Health; Histologic; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; innovation; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Lamins; lipid biosynthesis; Marrow; Measures; mechanical force; mechanical load; Mechanics; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Methods; mouse model; Mus; Nuclear; Obesity; Osteogenesis; osteogenic; osteoprogenitor cell; Pathway interactions; Periodicity; Pharmacology; Phosphotransferases; Physicians; Physiological; Population; prevent; Proteins; public health relevance; recruit; Regulation; Regulatory Pathway; Resistance; response; Role; Running; Scientist; sedentary; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; skeletal; Stem cells; Stress Fibers; Structure; synergism; Tamoxifen; Testing; Time; trafficking; Work; ","Mechanical regulation of cytoskeleton guides beta-catenin effect on MSC fate","066616","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","220000","114400","334400",""

I will use quantitative and qualitative methods to address this issue. I will develop surveys to measure success in coordination that include the perspective of the patient, PCP, and specialist (the ?triad?); I will conduct patient and provider interviews to understand facilitators and barriers to successful coordination efforts; and I will develop an intervention to improve coordination of care for the triad that builds on existing processes.

It is now timely to use the tools and analytical approaches developed by the HCP to elucidate how the structural and functional wiring of the brain develops and changes during childhood. We propose to acquire, analyze, and publicly share 1500 high quality neuroimaging and associated behavioral datasets on neurotypical children and adolescents in the age range of 5-21 years. These data will also be compared to existing HCP data from 1200 healthy young adults, generating a unique multi-project resource that provides rich, multimodal data on several biological and cognitive constructs that are of critical importance to understanding health and well-being across a broad age range.","1885436; 6250126; 1899502; 6777528; 10297869; 9763495; 1920201; 1891302 (contact); 6949910; ","BARCH, DEANNA ; BOOKHEIMER, SUSAN Y; BUCKNER, RANDY L; DAPRETTO, MIRELLA ; SMITH, STEPHEN MARK; SOMERVILLE, LEAH HELENE; THOMAS, KATHLEEN M; VAN ESSEN, DAVID C.

The university is located in Southeast Tennessee bordering the states of Georgia and Alabama, and its regional constituency deals with limited access to healthcare and limited opportunity to engage in professional preparation programs, or biomedical and bio behavioral research (BBR). Faculty at UTC are currently engaged in a limited amount of BBR representing a variety of substantive areas including the study of aging and mental health; obesity prevention and physical activity promotion in children, adolescents, and young adults; the genetics of colon cancer; bioinformatics; and the biologic activity and potential health effects of discarded tobacco products, as well as other applied research areas in public health. Funding from the NIH BRAD program will enable UTC to further enhance its capacity to support these and similar fields of BBR among faculty as well as provide expanded research opportunities among graduate and undergraduate students who represent underserved populations. The results of such improved research activity on the part of UTC BBR faculty will also result in improved and informed instruction among undergraduate and graduate students with the ultimate goal of improving health outcomes among residents of the greater Chattanooga region, the state of Tennessee, and the nation as a whole.","2060108; ","HEATH, GREGORY WAYNE;","WHITE, DELLA","05/01/2014","04/30/2019","Address; Administrator; Adolescent and Young Adult; Adult; Advocacy; Advocate; Aging; Alabama; Applied Research; Area; Associate Degree; Award; base; behavioral health; Behavioral Research; Bioinformatics; Businesses; career; Catheters; Child; college; Colon Carcinoma; Communities; County; Data; design; Development; Economically Deprived Population; Education; Educational process of instructing; Educational workshop; educationally disadvantaged; Environment; Equipment and supply inventories; ethnic diversity; Ethnic Origin; Exposure to; Extramural Activities; Faculty; faculty research; faculty support; Family; Focus Groups; Fostering; Funding; Funding Opportunities; Generations; Genetic; Goals; graduate student; Grant; Health; health care availability; Health Professional; Health Sciences; Health Services Research; improved; Incentives; Industry; Institutes; Institution; Instruction; Internships; Journals; low socioeconomic status; Manuscripts; Measurable; Medicine; meetings; Mental Health; Mentors; metropolitan; obesity prevention; organizational structure; Outcome; Physical activity; Policies; Population; Preparation; Principal Investigator; Procedures; Program Development; programs; Public Health; public health relevance; Race; racial and ethnic; Research; Research Activity; research and development; Research Personnel; Research Proposals; Research Training; Resources; Series; skill acquisition; Socioeconomic Status; Strategic Planning; Students; Tennessee; Tobacco; Training; training opportunity; Training Support; undergraduate student; Underserved Population; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Update; Writing; ","University of Tennessee at Chattanooga BRAD Project: Chattanooga Research Enhance","080232","ZHD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","81074","6486","87560",""

We propose develop a safe and effective system for measuring Mtb transmission from naïve to infected animals that will simultaneously determine other factors associated with transmission including Mtb-induced cough and aerosolized Mtb particle production. We will then use this system to analyze the transmission dynamics of a panel of Mtb strains representing multiple lineages to determine relationships between lineage and transmissibility. This approach represents the first systematic analysis of transmission dynamics in Mtb using experimental animals.","1892247; ","SHILOH, MICHAEL ;","LACOURCIERE, KAREN A","05/10/2018","04/30/2020","aerosolized; Aerosols; air sampling; Animal Experimentation; Animal Model; Animals; Bacteria; Biological Models; Biomedical Engineering; C3HeB/FeJ Mouse; Cavia; Coughing; Data; Drug resistance in tuberculosis; Drug-sensitive; Epidemiology; epidemiology study; Equipment; Evaluation; expectation; experimental study; extensive drug resistance; Foundations; Future; Human; human disease; Immunologics; in vivo; Individual; Infection; insight; interest; Interferon Type I; Laboratories; Lead; Life Cycle Stages; Lung diseases; Measures; Mediating; Microbiology; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Mouse Strains; Multi-Drug Resistance; Mus; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Nebulizer; novel; novel strategies; particle; pathogen; Pathologic; Persons; Phase; Population; portability; pressure; Prevalence; Production; Recording of previous events; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; Research; response; success; System; T-Cell Proliferation; Testing; Tissues; transmission process; Tuberculosis; Virulence; Work; World Health; ","Transmission dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis","137545","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","150000","60650","210650",""

Factors that contribute to difficult T2DM management in CKD may include low patient adherence, and conservative provider prescription decision-making, resulting from lack of long-term data on potential benefits and harms of certain medications over others in CKD as well as from little clinical experience with newer drugs. The proposed research aims to understand the comparative safety and effectiveness of various strategies aimed to manage T2DM in CKD, and to understand factors that currently influence patient and provider choice of these strategies.","9476414; ","RHEE, JINNIE J.;","RANKIN, TRACY L","05/10/2017","05/09/2022","Adherence; administrative database; Adult; Affect; Agonist; Antidiabetic Drugs; apprenticeship; Area; Attitude; Award; Belief; Benefits and Risks; cardiovascular disorder risk; Cardiovascular system; career; Caring; Cessation of life; Chronic; Chronic Kidney Failure; Clinical; clinical practice; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; comparative; Compliance behavior; Data; Databases; Decision Making; diabetes management; Diabetes Mellitus; Dipeptidyl Peptidases; Disease; Dose; Effectiveness; Emergency department visit; Endocrinologist; Epidemiologist; Epidemiology; Event; experience; glucagon-like peptide 1; glycemic control; Goals; Health; Health Services Research; Heart failure; high risk; Hospitalization; Hypoglycemia; inhibitor/antagonist; Insulin; International; Intervention Studies; Interview; medical specialties; medication compliance; meetings; Metformin; Methods; Mind; Modification; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Myocardial Infarction; New Agents; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel therapeutics; Observational Study; Outcome; patient oriented; patient population; Patients; Pattern; Peripheral arterial disease; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacoepidemiology; Pharmacology; Play; Population; Prevalence; Primary Care Physician; Provider; Public Health; Qualitative Research; Reading; recruit; Regimen; Research; Research Personnel; Resources; Risk Factors; Role; Safety; Series; skills; stroke; Structure; Sulfonylurea Compounds; Sum; symposium; Therapeutic; Thiazolidinediones; Time; Training; Universities; Weight Gain; Work; ","Toward optimizing diabetes care in persons with chronic kidney disease","110221","DDK","Kidney, Urologic and Hematologic Diseases D Subcommittee ","","","02","142630","11410","154040",""

To date, the only effective therapies are the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (Azacytidine and Decitabine), but even with this therapy, approximately 60% of patients do not respond. Currently there are no accurate molecular biomarkers that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of diagnosis, and therefore a vast majority of patients are forced to receive up to 6 months of Azacytidine before they can be offered alternative therapies. Moreover, it is unclear why some patients respond while others don't. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency that we develop more accurate ways of risk-stratifying patients at the time of diagnosis in order to prevent the unwarranted treatment of a large fraction of patients who are unlikely to ever respond to these agents as well as to identify novel alternative therapeutic targets.","9736624; ","FIGUEROA, MARIA EUGENIA;","WELNIAK, LISBETH A","07/01/2015","04/30/2019","Acute Myelocytic Leukemia; Age; Algorithms; Alternative Therapies; Azacitidine; base; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; bisulfite sequencing; Bone Marrow; Characteristics; chemotherapy; Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure; Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia; Classification; Clinical; clinical biomarkers; cohort; CpG Islands; cytopenia; Data; Decitabine; Development; Diagnosis; differential expression; Disease; Disease Management; Distal; DNA; DNA Methylation; DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor; Drug resistance; Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes; effective therapy; Elderly; Enhancers; epigenetic marker; Epigenetic Process; epigenome; epigenomics; Exons; Expression Profiling; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profile; Gene Mutation; Genetic Transcription; Genome; genome-wide; genome-wide analysis; Genomics; Hematological Disease; Hematopoiesis; Hypercellular Bone Marrow; Hypermethylation; in vivo; Ineffective Hematopoiesis; ineffective therapies; Introns; ITGB3 gene; Lead; Machine Learning; Massive Parallel Sequencing; Molecular; molecular diagnostics; molecular marker; Mutation Analysis; next generation; next generation sequencing; novel; Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences; overexpression; Pancytopenia; patient stratification; Patients; peripheral blood; Play; PPBP gene; predicting response; predictive marker; prevent; Promoter Regions; public health relevance; Regimen; Resistance; responders and non-responders; response; response biomarker; Risk; Role; Specimen; Syndrome; Technology; therapeutic target; therapy resistant; Time; transcriptome sequencing; Translating; treatment response; unnecessary treatment; Validation; ","Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes","126947","CBSS","Cancer Biomarkers Study Section ","","","04","265547","124253","389800",""

The proximal tubule (PT) cells of the kidney secrete most of this H+ into the fluid that is eventually excreted as urine. This process, which helps maintain the acid-base status of the body, increases under conditions of acidosis. However, PT cells do not sense H+ per se, but the ratio of CO2/HCO3? (the components of soda water) in the blood. Indeed, this ratio rises during acidosis. Preliminary work suggests that a protein known as receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase ? (RPTP?), which weaves through the cell membrane of PT cells that faces the blood, is the CO2/HCO3? sensor. Part of RPTP? is on the outside of the PT cell, facing the blood. Interestingly, this part of RPTP? has a region that resembles the well-studied enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA). This is the CA-like domain (CALD). However, it appears that mutations that have occurred during evolution have destroyed RPTP??s enzymatic activity. Another part of RPTP?, on the inside of the PT cell, can remove phosphate groups from target proteins. This activity is important for sending signals among molecules within the PT cell. The goals of this project are: (1) To identify how the binding of CO2 and HCO3? to the CALD of RPTP? control RPTP??s ability to remove phosphate groups on target proteins. (2) To understand how RPTP? and its target proteins control the secretion of H+ by the living proximal tubules. And (3) to understand how RPTP?, and the proteins that it sends signals to, control the pH of the blood in living animals during acidosis. The proposed work could have important implications for clinical approaches to acidosis, which is common in a wide range of diseases; hypertension, schizophrenia, and cancer.","9227544; ","BORON, WALTER F;","KETCHUM, CHRISTIAN J","06/10/2017","04/30/2021","Acidosis; Acids; Address; Adenoviruses; Animals; Apical; apical membrane; Astrocytes; base; Bicarbonates; Binding; Blood; Blood gas; body system; Carbon Dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; Carbonic Anhydrase II; Cell membrane; cell type; Cells; Chemistry; Chronic; Clinical; Data; Dimerization; Disease; Elements; Enzymes; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor; ERBB2 gene; Evolution; Exhibits; extracellular; Face; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Functional disorder; Genetic Transcription; Goals; GTP-Binding Proteins; Hypertension; inhibitor/antagonist; inorganic phosphate; insight; interdisciplinary approach; Kidney; kidney cell; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Lead; Ligand Binding Domain; Link; Liquid substance; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Membrane; Metabolic; Metabolic acidosis; Metabolism; Molecular; Monitor; Mus; mutant; Mutation; Organ; Orphan; Patients; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Physicians; Play; prevent; Process; protein profiling; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase; Proteins; Proximal Kidney Tubules; receptor; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Recombinant Proteins; Regulation; respiratory; Respiratory Acidosis; response; Role; Sampling; Schizophrenia; sensor; Shock; Side; Signal Transduction; soft drink; Testing; Translating; Urine; Viral; virtual; Water; Work; ","Role of RPTP-gamma in sensing and transducing acid-base disturbances in the renal proximal tubule","113197","KMBD","Kidney Molecular Biology and Genitourinary Organ Development ","","","02","318862","191317","510179",""

The socioeconomic impact of AD is estimated to cost 0.9-3.8 billion dollars per year. Furthermore, AD is a risk factor for other atopic disease like food allergy and asthma. Current immunotherapy for AD is based on broad immunosuppression or desensitization approaches, whereas physiologically oriented, specific manipulations are lacking. Activation of MC by IgE-Ag complexes is central for initiation, maintenance and relapses of AD. The intensity and duration of the inflammatory function of IgE activated MC are controlled by pro-inflammatory neuro-mediators.

The project will provide a cost- effective model for engaging persons living with HIV in medical care that could be adopted by Health Departments throughout the United States as a public health program to improve HIV care and reduce HIV transmission. The focus of the study is to locate and re-engage people with HIV into care. Patients identified as recently out-of-care through combined clinic and HIV surveillance data will be randomized to either an active re-engagement intervention from the Health Department or usual linkage and engagement services. An estimated 600 out-of-care patients will be identified (300 per arm) from among more than 5,000 total HIV patients of the partner clinics. The primary outcome for CoRECT will evaluate whether patients in the active intervention arm are more likely to achieve viral load suppression within 12 months of the study intervention compared with those receiving usual services. These include reminder calls to patients prior to their scheduled appointments, active follow up after missed appointments (i.e. phone calls, letters, etc.). Participating clinics must accept same-day or walk-in appointments referred from the Health Department through the intervention arm.
